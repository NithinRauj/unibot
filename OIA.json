I learned a lot from the projects because we collaborated with professionals from other areas, including the Radiology Department of the IU School of Medicine and IU Health Methodist Hospital . What activities and events have you participated in at IUPUI? I have participated in several volunteering events through my sorority, such as the Zooboo at Indianapolis Zoo for Halloween and a donation drive for the Julian Center to help homeless women. These experiences helped me learn the importance of giving back to the community and of creating a positive impact. I also have participated in several events with Asian Student Union (ASU). They often host fun events, such as a date auction for Valentine's Day or pumpkin painting for Halloween. They also host workshops about different Asian cultures and Asian-American issues/experiences. Through those events, I was able to make friends while learning more about other cultures.

The Electrical Engineering program at IUPUI was what really brought me here. My sister was already at IUPUI and she really loved it. I also really liked the idea of the downtown location because, as an international student without a car, it allowed me to still get internships, jobs, and explore the city easily. How has IUPUI helped you to reach your career goals? I went to the IUPUI career fairs and always made a point of talking to the people at the Cummins booth. During my final year at IUPUI, I chose to do a research project on Cummins and I was able to talk with several employees about the company. I think this really impressed the person working the Cummins booth at the career fair that year, which is what lead to my internship, and eventually lead to a full time job. What advice would you give to future students looking for an internship or job? Think about your grades, but also think about what sets you apart from other students besides academics. Help out around the community, get involved on campus, develop communication skills, and be open to learning about different cultures and norms. If you’re confident, employers pick up on that, and it will help you immensely.

What is the best way to make friends on and off campus? For me, being in the International Peer Mentor Program ( IPMP ) was one of the best ways to make friends on campus. I’ve met a lot of different people from a lot of different places which is awesome. I also met a lot of people from being involved in the Muslim Student Organization as well as the Egyptian Student Organization .

IUPUI provided the Purdue Engineering degree I was looking for and was one of the few universities that provided scholarships for international students. How did you choose your major? I started off as a Mechanical Engineer but then changed to Computer Engineering. One thing I like about the American Education System is its flexibility. I was able to change my major the second that I decided to. I chose computer engineering because it allowed me to study both the hardware and the software sides of computers. How do you get involved on campus? I am part of the the Egyptian Student Association on campus. I started off as treasurer, and then became vice president. We like to organize events that promote our culture so that we can share it with everyone else. I also like to play soccer on campus and take part in the intramural soccer tournament every year. How do you like Indianapolis? Indianapolis is very different from where I come from. It is quieter and more relaxed. But there are also areas where you can experience the hustle and bustle of a big city. I like this mix because depending on my mood, I can find something that I want to do. Americans, generally and people from Indiana, specifically tend to be really nice. They smile at you while walking in the street, they greet you in the morning and they hold the door for you when you’re entering a building.

I also developed the courage to speak with different people, while improving my communication and educational skills. This allowed me to get involved in more social activities and make new friends. Why did you choose IUPUI over other universities? I chose to come to IUPUI because it is an urban campus located very close to downtown Indianapolis. I also had many friends who got acepted here. In addition, many Saudi companies value Purdue’s Engineering degrees, so I decided to study at the Purdue School of Engineering at IUPUI to help me get a job easily after I graduate.

I have participated in many events with the Saudi Students Club, in addition to other clubs like the Muslim Student Association and the International Club. One of the most important events on campus that I participated in was the Saudi National Day. We spent three months preparing for it, but at the end it was all worth it.

Professors can be pretty strict, especially in my field, but I have always found them to be helpful and invested in making sure their students succeed in the real world. What was your favorite thing about Indianapolis? I loved the accessibility of everything! If I needed anything for a class, or if I just wanted to go shopping or go out with friends, it was all within walking distance or a short drive. There’s also an abundance of food here in the city. You will never get bored! What advice or encouragement would you give to international students who are considering attending IUPUI? Coming to IUPUI has been one of the greatest decisions I’ve made. The classes are smaller, the professors are genuinely interested in teaching and helping their students succeed, there’s an abundance of volunteer opportunities, I’m able to connect with people from all over the world, and I have quick and easy to access to just about anything my heart desires. IUPUI has helped me branch out and try new things. I have learned so much about myself during my time here!

What major are you and why did you choose your particular major? I am a computer science major and I study at the Purdue School of Science.

After graduation, I finished my master’s degree in Engineering Management from Northeastern University in Boston. I now live in Los Angeles where I work as a project engineer for a company that makes simulation cockpits for helicopters and jets. Did you complete any internships or OPT before/after graduation? If so, what steps did you take to find such opportunities? I’m currently on OPT. I had 2 internships while at IUPUI, one with Schlumberger in Egypt and the other with General Cable in Indianapolis. I got the General Cable internship by applying and interviewing with them when they were recruiting on campus. I would definitely advise students to pursue at least 2 internships before graduating and keep their minds open about the fields they want to work in. I never thought I would work in the cable industry but that internship was a great learning opportunity and I really enjoyed working there. Meet Youssef!

Combining the resources of two prestigious universities with our downtown Indianapolis location, we offer students the opportunity to earn a respected degree from Indiana University or Purdue University while enjoying all the benefits of city life. Will I earn an IUPUI degree? No. You will earn an IU or Purdue degree. If your major is an IU program, like Management or Finance, then your degree is granted by IU and your diploma will say Indiana University on it. Similarly Purdue programs, like Motorsports Engineering or Biology will grant a Purdue University degree and diploma. How much will my education cost? Most international students are considered “non-residents” for tuition purposes and pay an out-of-state rate. See the total cost of attendance here . If you are an international student and currently live in Indiana, you may qualify as a “resident” if you meet certain requirements. Learn more . What financial aid is available to first year international students? We offer both merit-based and competitive admissions based scholarships.

The Honors College is a program high-achieving students can apply to in addition to their major. Honors College students love to learn and want additional challenges and opportunities, like academic research with faculty, smaller and more rigorous classes, study abroad, and community based projects. In addition to these opportunities, Honors students get the added support of special advising and additional scholarships, up to the full cost of tuition! Learn more. Can I double major? Can I add a minor? Yes! Some majors are easy to combine because some of your coursework will count toward both majors or your major/minor, such as Computer Science and Computer Engineering or Mechanical Engineering and Physics. Other combinations may require more careful planning, because there is less overlap between the two programs, such as Actuarial Science and Painting. Contact us to learn more. Can I do an internship? Yes! Each school has career services to provide support in writing resumes, finding and applying for internships. Learn more . Can I get a part-time job?

What is Indianapolis like? Indianapolis, or “Indy”, is a mid-sized city and the capital of Indiana. Being mid-sized means that costs are lower, there is less traffic, but we still have lots to do! From our convenient downtown campus location, you have access to professional sports, museums, shopping, dining, parks and more. Learn more about things to do in Indy . Due to our geographic location, we also enjoy all four seasons. Learn more about weather . Is on-campus housing available?

Official documents must arrive in the original unopened envelope as issued by the originating institution. Do I have to submit my official degree certificate or diploma?

In those cases where a separate, official diploma must be submitted to verify graduation, the official diploma will be returned to the student. May I request the return of my official academic transcripts? No. All materials submitted in support of an IUPUI application become the property of IUPUI and are not returnable, forwarded, copied, or released to the student or to third parties.

Your records should also include any coursework currently in progress. Failure to submit all academic documents will result in the automatic withdrawal of your application.

Your program department will need certain types of supporting documents for the initial review of your application. If they make a decision to admit you to their program, then we will need additional supporting documents to finalize your admission. Types of Documents Needed by Departments Official Academic Records You must submit full and complete academic records from every university/post-secondary institution you have attended. Your records should also include any coursework currently in progress. Failure to submit all academic documents will result in the automatic withdrawal of your application. You must submit academic documents in the native language and provide an English translation by an official translation agency unless your institution issues academic documents in English. Please note there are exceptions to this policy and students will be notified during OIA’s admission review if further documentation is required. While an electronic copy of your records can be accepted to make an admission decision, once you are admitted by OIA you will be required to submit official transcripts, in a university sealed envelope , to verify their authenticity. Transcript evaluations by Credential Evaluation agencies are NOT necessary nor required. Proof of English Proficiency If you are a non-native speaker, please review our graduate standards for our English proficiency requirements . Test Scores Your department may require one or more of the following tests. Minimum scores required vary and are determined by the graduate program. For all required tests (including TOEFL), you must request that the testing agencies send official score reports to IUPUI. You may also wish to submit photocopies of your test results to ensure receipt of scores. IUPUI's Testing Services Codes: 1325 GRE : Many graduate studies committees require that you take the Graduate Record Examination General (GRE) Test. Check with the committee for more information. All fellowship applicants are required to take the GRE. GMAT : Graduate programs in Business and Accounting require that you take the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT). CGFNS : Applicants to graduate nursing programs are required to take the Council of Graduates of Foreign Nursing Schools qualifying examination (CGFNS) as a prerequisite for the State Licensure Examination for nurses in Indiana. Applicants must hold current nursing licenses in their home countries and achieve licensure in Indiana prior to enrollment in clinical nursing courses at IUPUI. LSAT : All applicants to the School of Law must take the Law School Admission Test (LSAT). Letters of Recommendation Graduate applicants typically need three letters of recommendation from major professors in their most recent degree program. Those not currently in school may include a letter from a past or current employer as one of the three. Check with your program about any specific requirements for recommendation letters. Other Resume Portfolio of past work (Example: If applying to Herron School of Art and Design) Personal Statement Check with your department for specific information on any of these items and what is required. Types of Documents Needed by OIA Academic Records These will be the same ones sent to your department for the initial review. Your department will forward them to our office for final review. Proof of English Proficiency These will be the same as what you sent to your department for the initial review. Your department will forward them to our office for final review. Financial Documentation (only for students requiring a visa to study) For those students who require a student visa (F1/J1), you must submit financial documentation verifying your ability to pay your tuition and living expenses . If someone other than yourself is providing funds, you will also need to submit the Financial Support Agreement. These items should be uploaded through your Atlas account. We will not be able to issue you the documentation you will need for your visa appointment until you have completed this step. **Please review the Graduate Estimated Expenses chart for more information on program cost. Clarification of Present Visa Status We want to make sure that we issue you the correct immigration documentation. If you are currently in the US, it’s important that you complete the “Submit Clarification of your Present Immigration Status” form on Atlas . You will be asked to submit copies of your current I-20, I-94, or any other immigration documentation you may have. This step is especially important if you currently hold an F-1 student visa and will need us to transfer your current SEVIS record to IUPUI. If you are a US Citizen, Permanent Resident, Refugee, or Asylee then you should apply through the IUPUI Graduate Office . Copy of Your Passport ID Page In order to make sure we have the correct spelling and format of your name on any immigration documentation we issue you, please complete the “Submit a copy of your Passport ID Page” form on Atlas . Document Policy All materials submitted in support of an IUPUI application become the property of IUPUI and are not returnable, forwarded, copied, or released to the student or to third parties. This includes financial documentation submitted for purposes of obtaining a student or scholar visa. Students are advised to bring additional copies of their official educational documents in envelopes signed, sealed and stamped by the issuing institution should they have need of their official educational documents while in the U.S. About IUPUI Academics Connect with Us Tuition & Fees Scholarships & Funding How to Apply Freshman Students Transfer Students Graduate Students Admission Standards Deadlines for Admission English Submit Supporting Documents After You Apply Office of International Affairs social media channels Twitter Facebook Instagram YouTube Copyright © 2023 The Trustees of Indiana University , Copyright Complaints Accessibility | Privacy Notice"

New York Street, ES 2126 Indianapolis, IN 46202 U.S. University Transfer Credit We require final official transcripts to perform a transfer credit evaluation for U.S. institutions. Documents must be sent to Office of International Affairs. Make sure documents are sent to address above. Use the Transfer Rule Catalog to find out how your existing U.S. coursework transfers to IUPUI . An email will be sent to you once your credit has been posted to your account Non-U.S. University Transfer Credit We are here to help you get credit for qualified, equivalent coursework you've taken. We offer preliminary transfer credit evaluations for admitted students based on unofficial transcripts from institutions outside the U.S. only. Step 1: Preliminary Transfer Credit Evaluation Preliminary transfer credit evaluations are NOT a guarantee of credit because they are based on unofficial documents. Your preliminary evaluation is for your use only and cannot be used to schedule classes, to meet with advisor, or to determine progress toward a degree here at IUPUI. Your Preliminary Transfer Credit Evaluation lists the courses and how many semester hours may be transferred to IUPUI. After you are fully admitted, the Preliminary Transfer Credit Evaluation will be sent to you via email attachment within 2-3 weeks. Evaluation Example Previous Uni. Course Title / Number Previous Credits IUPUI Department / Course Number IUPUI Credits Basic Economics EC1003 4 ECON #100A 3 Mathematics MA2013 3 MATH-UN 100 2 In order to proceed to the next phase, official documents must be submitted to Office of International Affairs. Step 2: Submit Your Official, Final Transcripts and Supporting Documentation Official final transcripts must arrive in the original, unopened envelope as issued by the originating institution. Course descriptions and syllabus can help with course articulation. Step 3: Official Transfer Credit Evaluation Credit will be posted to your IUPUI academic record as undistributed or as articulated by IUPUI faculty. An email will be sent to you once your official credit has been posted to your student account. Step 4: Meet with Your Academic Advisor At orientation, set up a one-on-one meeting with your academic advisor. During this meeting, your academic advisor will advise you on: How your undistributed credits could possibly be changed into specific IUPUI courses and count towards your degree requirements. How to work with departments outside your major to have courses articulated The classes you register for will depend upon your placement test results and whether or not you can get your transfer credit to count for specific IUPUI courses. Bring to the meeting: A copy of your transcripts Course descriptions as they would appear in a university prospectus or bulletin (mandatory) Course syllabus (very helpful) Textbook title(s) and assigned chapters (very helpful) Table of contents from textbooks (helpful) The more documentation you can provide to your advisor and the department, the easier it will be to review your previous credits for transfer. Upon review of the information you provide, each department will send the completed Transfer Credit Distribution Form to our office stating whether the course can be distributed. Then we will post the course to your academic record. The evaluation can take several weeks, so start early if you need the IUPUI course posted before registration. Courses that do not have IUPUI equivalents will remain as undistributed credits and can sometimes be used to fulfill degree electives (courses outside your major). Check back with your academic advisor to see if they may be able to fulfill any elective requirements towards your degree. What Does NOT Transfer English courses from non-native English speaking countries \"C-\" grade or lower Subjects which are not offered at IUPUI Please email tccredit@iupui.edu with any questions about the transfer credit process. Transfer Credit Definitions Official documents: Documents are only considered official when they arrive in the original, unopened envelope as issued by the originating institution. Undistributed credit: When a student has coursework from an outside institution to which there is no equivalent course here at IUPUI, the course is considered undistributed. This means it may not have an equivalent at IUPUI, however, it does not mean the course may not be considered for elective credit. Course articulation: Course articulation is the process of evaluating courses from an outside institution to determine if the course applies toward a degree at IUPUI.

Yes. As an incoming international student, you will be in a group that focuses on American culture and English (for academics). The skills you will learn by participating will help ease you into the American college experience and help you to become more successful in the U.S. What are the benefits of participating? Students who participate in the Summer Bridge Program typically earn higher grades at the end of the first semester than those who do not participate. Participating in the Summer Bridge Program will allow you to arrive on campus two weeks before classes begin. You'll get to meet new friends and also become comfortable with the campus before all the other students arrive. As a bridge participant, you will also get to make connections with faculty, staff and older students earlier in your college experience. What about Housing? If you are a first-year F-1 or J-1 visa student planning on living in campus housing for the fall semester, you can arrange to move in early by contacting Housing and Residence Life. Your housing contract will automatically be amended to reflect the prorated cost of the additional days. On-Campus housing options can be found on the Housing and Residence Life website . If you are not planning on living in campus housing, or if you have not signed your housing contract before July 1, you are responsible for finding your own arrangements or alternative housing for the Summer Bridge Program. You can find temporary hotel accommodations within reasonable distance to the campus. If you have housing related questions, you can ask iwelcome@iupui.edu or reshalls@iupui.edu . Can I Miss Any Days of the Summer Bridge Program? No. You are expected to arrive to Indianapolis on the date printed on your I-20 or DS-2019. Your orientation activities will follow the schedule posted to our website.  Attendance is mandatory and you may not miss any days. If you will be having problems getting to Indianapolis before the date on your I-20 and/or participating in Summer Bridge, you must contact iadvisor@iupui.edu immediately. Once you are here, if you need to be late or absent for an unexpected illness/emergency, you will need to contact your Bridge instructor or ucbridge@iupui.edu as soon as possible.

Planning for the Fall Semester First day of the semester August 21, 2023 We have included additional information on specific topics for you below. If you have additional questions, please contact us at iadvisor@iupui.edu . Placement Assessments Placement assessments are surveys that measure your current skills in a subject area and provide score ranges. These score ranges help academic advisors place you into courses in that subject area where you will be most successful. At IUPUI, students might take placement exams in English and mathematics. If you plan to earn a degree in science, technology, engineering, or math, you may also need to take the Chemistry assessment. You must take your placement exams before your academic advisor can give you complete course selection information .  Please review your Admission letter to see which assessments you are required to take. See more information about individual placement assessments A $52 placement test fee will be charged to your Bursar bill. This fee includes all placement tests (EAP, Math Skills Assessment, foreign language) that you may need to take. Bring a photo ID when you take the EAP exam. English for Academic Purposes, or EAP, Assessment All undergraduates are required to complete English W131 as a condition of graduation. The EAP exam tests your ability in academic English and determines if you should be placed into additional academic English courses in order to complete English W131 successfully. Learn more about IUPUI'S EAP department. See more detailed EAP assessment information » Math Assessment Most students must take this placement exam before they can register for a math class at IUPUI. The math placement exam used at IUPUI is called ALEKS (Assessment and LEarning in Knowledge Spaces). You begin this assessment from home (as long as you have internet) and can improve your placement by completing the review modules within the program. ALEKS allows students to take the placement first (be rested and studied) and then assigns each students review modules tailored to your skill level. Students can then work through the review modules and re-take the assessment. Once you arrive on campus, you will be assigned a time to take a proctored ALEKS assessment. Essentially, you will take the same ALEKS placement you have been working on at home, but in a computer lab on campus. Your academic advisor will then use your proctored ALEKS score and your desired field of study to select the math course that will meet your needs at IUPUI. See more detailed math placement assessment information » Chemistry Assessment The Chemistry Placement Assessment is an open-book, 45-minute, 40 multiple choice online tool to evaluate readiness to begin the main science major sequence, Chemistry C105-C106. Generally, students planning to earn degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics should plan to take CHEM C105. You cannot receive assistance from any person during the assessment to ensure accuracy of the placement process. The assessment can be taken on any computer with reliable internet access, but mobile devices or tablets are not suitable for testing. You must use a valid IU username to enroll in the placement assessment and you will only be allowed one attempt at the assessment. See more detailed chemistry assessment information » Technology IUPUI uses different software programs for different purposes. As a newly admitted student, it is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with the software you will come into contact with regularly. We have provided extensive resources for IUPUI Technology for your review here . In order to be prepared for International Welcome, please be sure to complete the following steps: Set up your IUPUI Technology Account Complete your Pre-Arrival checklist located in your iStart account. Register your DUO device (see your Pre-Arrival Checklist for complete instructions). Open the Canvas app in One.iu.edu at least once prior to coming to IUPUI.

The following immunizations/vaccinations are required for all students: Measles, Mumps, Rubella (commonly called the MMR vaccine in the United States) Varicella (or Chickenpox vaccine) Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis (commonly called Tdap vaccine in the United States) Meningitis View more information here. Students must submit verification of medical records to the university. Learn more by visiting IUPUI's Immunization Compliance website here. Step 1: Connect to One.iu.edu Use your university username and passphrase to access One.iu.edu Step 2: Locate Immunization Compliance records Once logged into your One.iu.edu account, use the search function to locate \"Immunization Compliance\" and click on the link that appears. Step 3: Submit your records Follow the instructions as directed within the \"Immunization Compliance\" application.  You will register with Med+ Proctor using your IU email address. If your records are not written in English, you must supply an official certified English translation. If you have one document that shows all of your immunization/vaccination records, submit that same document for each item. I have not received these vaccinations/immunizations. If you have not already received these vaccinations, our Student (Campus) Health Services does offer and administer these once you arrive to IUPUI. If covered under the IUPUI International Student Health Insurance policy (administered by Aetna), these vaccinations are fully covered. If you must pay out of pocket because your insurance plan does not cover these vaccinations, the Student Health Services office is usually the lowest cost medical facility to receive them. Expect a bill around $900 USD. I do not know which of these vaccinations/immunizations I have received. If you are unsure which, if any, of these vaccinations you have received, you may come to the Student Health Services office and discuss a 'titer' test with a nurse. Titer tests are tests that medical professionals can use to help determine immunities. These tests can help pinpoint which, if any, of the vaccinations above you need. If the titer test shows you have already received the vaccinations above, it can be submitted to verify your immunization/vaccination records. Be aware, a titer test may not be the best option based on your country of origin and medical history. You may discuss this option with the medical professionals on staff; they may recommend vaccinations or a titer test given your specific medical history. Tuberculosis (TB) Screening All incoming international students are required to undergo a tuberculosis (TB) screening after arrival at IUPUI and within five weeks of your first semester. TB screening will be administered by IUPUI Student Health, or you may also submit records of a U.S. based screening result. More information can be found on the Student Health webpage here. Please follow the steps above to submit evidence of your U.S. based TB Screening. Learn more by visiting IUPUI's Immunization Compliance Website here. The required vaccines and TB screening are covered under the IUPUI International Student Health Insurance plan administered by Aetna at no additional cost to you. This saves you about $900. Most substitute insurance plans do not cover these vaccines/immunizations/tests. If you have a substitute plan, expect about a $900 bill from the Campus Health Services office if you receive these treatments. Questions can be directed to healthsv@iupui.edu .

Steps to follow after admission: Find One.iu.edu Visit one.iu.edu and search for \"Create my First IU Account.\" Enter requested information You will need to enter: Your last name (you may refer to this as your family name) Your date of birth (mm/dd/yyyy format) Your IUPUI university ID number Read the User Agreement You will be prompted to read and agree to the user agreement. Click \"Yes\" once you have read the information. Select a username The system will give you a list of available usernames you can select from.

Example: Username - jkim233 Email address - jkim233@iu.edu Create your passphrase Enter your passphrase according to the rules. Remember this passphrase! You will need it every time you try to access a university computer or program. Passphrase authentication Select at least three different passphrase questions from the drop-down list and type the correct answers into the fields provided.

Explore CrimsonPerk Discounts Additionally, you may download many software programs such as the Adobe Creative Cloud and Microsoft Office 365 through IUWare. Windows 10 is available at a deep discount. Find Free and Discounted Software Cellular Phones in the United States Cellular phone companies (also called mobile phone companies or wireless providers) allow two payment models for service: postpaid service and prepaid service. You will need to decide which option is right for you. How should I choose a provider? You will want to choose a wireless service that provides competitive rates for calling your home country. Many students use their cell phone as their main means of communication. Low international rates will enable you to keep in touch with people at home without paying high fees. If you are a married student or are moving to Indianapolis with additional family members, choosing a company that offers additional lines at competitive fees can keep your monthly costs lower. Also, look at the wireless providers offering free mobile-to-mobile minutes. This enables you to call the other family members on your plan without using your minutes. Prepaid Service All major cell phone providers in the United States offer prepaid wireless plans. When you buy prepaid wireless service, a provider makes an agreed-upon number of minutes available to your cell phone. You pay for those minutes at the time of agreement. After you have used the minutes you purchased, you need to buy more minutes to be able to keep using your phone. This option does not typically require a credit check or a deposit.

IUPUI's campus is an approximately 20-minute drive from the airport. Black Car Services (private car, limousine and shuttle transportation), Uber, Lyft, and taxis are available from the airport directly to IUPUI and the surrounding Indianapolis area. Making transportation arrangements in advance is strongly encouraged to avoid unnecessary complications during travel.

This may be a convenient option if you need to stay at a hotel prior to moving into your IUPUI residence hall or off-campus apartment in Indianapolis. OIA Airport Shuttle The Office of International Affairs (OIA) is offering an airport shuttle service to new international students with a fee of $20 (plus convenience fee). The shuttle will only be offered on specific dates and times. Students can find information and reserve their seat through the Intent to Enroll and Arrival Plan eform in Atlas.

Travel interruptions can happen! Be prepared with an option for back-up accommodations for your arrival. If you arrive after your apartment office has closed, you will need to book a hotel or stay with a friend. If you will stay with a friend, contact your friend when you arrive at the airport to notify them that you are on your way -  especially if you have experienced any flight delays to ensure that your friend is awake and expecting to meet you when you arrive. Transportation from hotel/downtown location to other downtown location Students frequently arrive to Indianapolis too late in the day to check into their on-campus residence hall or off-campus apartment. In this case, you will need to make arrangements to stay at a hotel or with a friend until you are able to check into your on-campus residence hall or off-campus apartment. To get from your temporary location to your new home, you have the following transportation options: Ask a friend to assist you with transporting your belongings Request a taxi Request a ride on Uber or Lyft Learn more about transportation in Indianapolis >> Who can I contact if I experience a problem or concern while traveling?

Comfort and Entertainment There are also items that are good to bring for your comfort on your long flight. Items for entertainment: a book, music/headphones, etc. Toiletries: toothpaste/toothbrush, comb/brush, lotion Travel neck pillow Light sweater Bottled water (purchased after going through security) Snack foods for between meals Money You should bring with you at least U.S. $1,000-$1,500, even if you will be receiving IUPUI funding. You will need this money to pay for temporary housing, moving-in expenses for long-term housing, food, transportation, books, supplies, and other necessary items during your first few weeks in the U.S. (Payments to graduate students on assistantships and visiting scholars begin about four to six weeks after arrival). If you are bringing a bank check, have it made out to yourself — not the university — so that you can deposit the funds in a bank account here and then arrange for tuition and other payments. The University cannot accept checks greater than the amount of the first semester's tuition. At some banks these funds will not be available to you for over one week after deposit. Bring some cash — U.S. $100-$200 in small bills ($10 and $20 bills). Automatic teller machines (ATMs) frequently have a $300 per day limit on cash withdrawals. Carry your money and valuables in several places on your person, such as a wallet or purse, a separate pocket, and a pouch worn around your neck, waist, or under your clothing. That way, if your bag, wallet, or purse is stolen, you have not lost everything. Health Records and Medications IUPUI requires proof of immunizations for all new students. Non-English documents must be translated into English.  The following immunizations are required: Measles, Mumps, Rubella (commonly called the MMR vaccine), Varicella (Chickenpox), Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis (commonly called Tdap vaccine). To verify your medical records: Use your IUPUI University Username and Passphrase to log into One.iu.edu . Type \"Immunization\" into the search box, then click on the \"Immunization Compliance\" icon that appears. Now you will need to upload proof of immunizations for each item listed above. You must upload English translations . If you have one document showing all of your immunizations, upload it again for each required item.  If you have not already received these vaccinations, our Campus Health Services offers these once you arrive at IUPUI. If you are in the U.S. and need a referral to a translator, please contact OIA. Additionally, you will be asked to upload proof of a tuberculosis (TB) test taken in the United States. ﻿ If you do not have this, then TB screening will be administered by IUPUI Campus Health. You must visit the Campus Health office and get your TB test within 5 weeks. After you have uploaded proof of immunizations and a TB Test, submit the form. Students in health-related programs which include patient care may be required to show proof of immunizations to their academic department. Please check with your department to see if any immunizations are required. It is advisable to bring any current medications as well as any medical records that you might need during your stay in the United States, especially if you have any serious health conditions. If a U.S. medical doctor will need to see your records shortly after arrival in the U.S., make sure the records are in English, or obtain a translation. Checked Baggage Your checked baggage should contain mostly clothing. Make sure to prepare appropriately for the weather . If you are starting in the Fall semester, the weather will probably be hot. Students arriving in January should be prepared for very cold weather. See average temperatures for Indianapolis » Almost everything you need will be available in the United States. Pack the items you will need immediately, and purchase other items later. Clothing If you are arriving in the summer, bring: Short-sleeved shirts Shorts Jeans Light jacket and/or sweater Pair of sandals and a pair of comfortable walking shoes Socks and underwear Sunglasses If you are arriving in the winter, bring clothing that you can layer. This will keep you warmer, and you can take off layers as it gets warmer. Long-sleeved shirts Sweaters and/or sweatshirts/hoodies Long pants and jeans Winter coat Winter hat and gloves Warm socks Water-resistant shoes/boots Electronics Electronics you may want to bring: International Adaptor (U.S. uses 110 V) Cell phone Laptop Camera USB drive IUPUI students can buy laptops from the campus bookstore at a discounted price. Additionally, many software programs (such as Microsoft Office) are available at a deep discount or even for free. Learn about free and discounted software » Other Items You should avoid purchasing too many household items in advance, because it may increase your luggage costs, and will make your travel very difficult. If your housing does not provide basic household items, then you may want to bring these items: Bath towel Bed sheets and pillow case Basic toiletries (bring travel sized items and buy full-sized items in the U.S.) 1 Plate/Bowl, fork, knife, spoon, chopsticks Spices used in your home cooking Favorite decoration to remind you of home When packing any food items, it is essential to find out first if you are allowed to bring that item into the United States. Learn more about the Port-of-Entry » Shipping Items Because almost everything you need will be available in the United States, it is not recommended that you spend a lot of money on shipping items here before you travel. It is best to arrive in Indianapolis and check out items and their prices here. Later on, if there are items that you miss from home that you can't find in Indianapolis, then ask your family to ship them to you. Please do not ship items to the Office of International Affairs, as we do not have storage space to hold boxes. When shipping items, please make sure to follow U.S. Customs and Border Protection rules regarding restricted items, or else you may not be able to receive your package. Purchasing Items Upon Arrival All the items that you will need for housing purposes can be purchased here in the U.S. OIA will have shopping trips available before and during the Welcome Week to help students buy the items they need. To learn more about suggested items for your new home at IUPUI, see the What to Bring Move-In Guide on the Housing and Residence Life website. Although this list is specific to on-campus housing, you can get goo d ideas about what you will might need for off-campus housing. You might also consider having items shipped to you if you are without transportation. Search online for \"student dorm packages\" and you will find several companies that will deliver start-up sets straight to your housing address. Sets come in many varieties, and can contain bedding, household items, bathroom necessities, kitchen items, decorations, and so on. Looking for Welcome Information?

Kahn Dear OIA Friends, Welcome to the Fall 2020 semester at IUPUI. This year has been a whirlwind for us all, and the uncertainty and volatility with which we have been grappling is far from over. The world is struggling against COVID-19 and the United States is dealing with its own turmoil and entrenched history of systemic racism. The Office of International Affairs (OIA) has been reckoning with all of this, from managing the onslaught of federal policies around immigration and the suspension of international travel and overseas programs, to the severe difficulties international students and scholars are facing during this time of crisis, and our own tackling of social injustice in the field of international education. OIA staff, as always, have been solid and impeccably capable as they support international students, advance global learning, serve the campus, and continue to engage the world through these unprecedented times. While times are challenging, this is not the time for OIA to retreat and wait until the situation improves. Quite the opposite, in fact. This is a moment where OIA is doubling down on its commitment to international education and recommitting to our mission of making the world a better and more diverse and inclusive place. This year, we will advance internationalization at IUPUI by expanding access to global learning for all students; partnering with IUPUI units and organizations and institutions around the world to strengthen the infrastructure for global engagement; rebuilding and further diversifying IUPUI’s international student enrollment; and making Indiana and the world a better place by aligning our work with the 2030 UN Sustainable Development Goals. In so doing, we will be better advocates by making sure everyone at IUPUI and beyond understands the necessity of global competencies and experiences, international mobility, and why we need IUPUI to unapologetically embrace its global identity as well as its responsibility to the world. We have our work cut out for us, but you must know that the Office of International Affairs is dedicated to this more than ever. We will stand tall and work diligently for what we believe is best for IUPUI and the world. We will make sure our international students are wholly supported and are given the best chance to succeed at IUPUI and beyond. We will strengthen the foundation for global teaching and interdisciplinary global research. We will make sure that IUPUI students start studying abroad again, soon. We will continue to stand in solidarity with those everywhere who fight against discrimination and social injustice, because racism is, and always has been, a global issue. We will be here to serve and work with you. We will be brazenly global and we will champion the international identity of IUPUI, even during this trying time. I thank all of you for the continued support of our work. I also want to particularly show my gratitude to the staff of the Office of International Affairs, who have been remarkable as they have managed the uncertain territory that the COVID-19 pandemic has created for them, for IUPUI, and for the world. Of course, we are fortunate that technology allows us to continue to collaborate together, share perspectives, and come up with answers to the problems our communities encounter. However, I must also say that I do really look forward to the day where we can share the same space, engage in international travel, and feel confident that we live in a better world. We will get there, together. All best, Hilary E.

Mansa is one of over 2,100 U.S. citizens who will conduct research, teach English, and provide expertise abroad for the 2020-2021 academic year through the Fulbright U.S. Student Program.  Recipients of Fulbright awards are selected on the basis of academic and professional achievement, as well as their record of service and leadership potential in their respective fields. The Fulbright Program is the U.S. government’s flagship international educational exchange program and is designed to build lasting connections between the people of the United States and the people of other countries.  The Fulbright Program is funded through an annual appropriation made by the U.S. Congress to the U.S. Department of State.  Participating governments and host institutions, corporations, and foundations around the world also provide direct and indirect support to the Program, which operates in over 160 countries worldwide. Since its establishment in 1946 under legislation introduced by the late U.S. Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas, the Fulbright Program has given more than 390,000 students, scholars, teachers, artists, and professionals of all backgrounds and fields the opportunity to study, teach and conduct research, exchange ideas, and contribute to finding solutions to shared international concerns. Fulbrighters address critical global challenges in all disciplines while building relationships, knowledge, and leadership in support of the long-term interests of the United States.  Fulbright alumni have achieved distinction in many fields, including 59 who have been awarded the Nobel Prize, 84 who have received Pulitzer Prizes, and 37 who have served as a head of state or government.

Kahn, Associate Vice Chancellor of International Affairs Dear OIA Friends, On behalf of the OIA team, I welcome you to the new year and wish you the best for the spring semester and coming year. This is a busy time for the Office of International Affairs. Our recruitment team is traveling to various world regions to meet prospective and admitted students and we are preparing for the many international students and scholars that will be joining us this year. As always, we are working with those who are already at IUPUI and providing various services to help them be prepared for the future, whether they are graduating, finding employment, or staying with us at IUPUI. We will be onboarding new cohorts for our International Peer Mentoring Program and International House, and we are helping send IUPUI students on a record number of overseas programs during spring break! We are building up important partnerships with institutions abroad, and we are working diligently to ensure that all students graduate with at least one meaningful global learning experience. We are also busy bringing various programmatic opportunities to campus for all of us to engage internationally. We will bring in truly amazing individuals to hear their stories, learn from their perspectives, and hold conversations that transcend our differences. And, of course, we have the IUPUI International Festival on February 27 and the various high-quality programs and activities that occur that week. This will be my first International Festival as Associate Vice Chancellor, and I am excited that we have the chance to bring the campus together to celebrate our international identity. The day and week of the International Festival will also provide OIA with a chance to hear from you, including an OIA Open Forum in Campus Center room CE 310 from 2-3:30 PM on the 27 th where faculty, staff, administrators, and students can provide feedback about how we can do what we do better. This will inform the strategic planning work we are engaged in this semester, and I ask you to stay in touch as more details emerge about this event and the entire International Festival and International Week. Ultimately, I hope you take advantage of all these activities and programs this semester, and that you continue to find the Office of International Affairs a campus resource that supports you as a member of IUPUI, whether you are in Indianapolis, Columbus, Fort Wayne, or beyond. Our goal is to make IUPUI an undeniable global and inclusive campus, and I look forward to engaging with you in conversation this semester about how we can collectively advance our international work.

For the Office of International Affairs, our commitment to international engagement, transnational mobility, and global learning has never been greater. While it has been trying to watch the cancellation of our study abroad programs, the departure of international students, the deferrals of visiting scholars, and the general isolationism and xenophobia that the pandemic has stirred, the importance of the global ethos of our campus and community--and the need for us to collectively solve issues that transcend boundaries--has never been more apparent. With this said, OIA is doubling down on our commitment to ensure that IUPUI is home to diverse and top-notch international students and scholars; that the campus unapologetically embraces its international identity as core to its mission, and that our students, faculty, and staff have opportunities to engage with the world, whether they study abroad, conduct global research, or transcend boundaries in classrooms. What we do matters more than ever, and I would like to provide you with some updates as we look to the future of international education at IUPUI. International Students: The rollercoaster of the COVID-19 pandemic has not been easy for IUPUI’s international students. Though some have departed the U.S., many have remained here to finish the Spring 2020 semester remotely. OIA has been regularly communicating with international students to keep them informed and provide guidance during the COVID-19 emergency.  OIA is providing its visa services, advising, and programming virtually, and we are grateful for the essential staff who continue to come to campus as needed to process critical immigration documents for our international students, scholars, and departments. We are obviously concerned about the ability of current and new international students to come to campus, and are working with Jay Gladden, Janice Blum, and others to develop online enrollment options for Fall 2020. For undergraduates, we are exploring ways to offer the 10-15 most common courses for international students in fully online formats for Fall 2020. OIA has worked with Boyd Bradshaw and the Division of Enrollment Management to increase scholarship offers to new undergraduates, and is actively engaging admitted students through personalized virtual meetings. Planning for the Fall 2021 recruitment cycle is underway, and we continue to support IUPUI schools in developing cooperative enrollment agreements with institutions abroad. Study Abroad: The Study Abroad office has been supporting school fiscal officers through the process of refunding student expenses associated with cancelled programs, in coordination with the Registrar, Bursar, and Student Financial Services offices. The cancellation of our study abroad programs this year was particularly disappointing, as IUPUI was again on its way to achieving a record year of students studying abroad. Nonetheless, we anxiously await and are planning for when we can again support program leaders and increase the number of IUPUI students studying abroad. Curriculum Internationalization: It has never been more obvious how much we need global learning at home, and we are intentionally expanding our resources to support this work.  We are delighted that the IUPUI Faculty Council and the Division of Student Affairs recently endorsed the IUPUI Dimensions of Global Learning , which define global preparedness for all students. OIA will offer professional development sessions this summer (virtually) and throughout the year to support global learning and international virtual exchange, and the office is partnering with the Division of Undergraduate Education to integrate global learning across the First Year Experience. Please note too that faculty bids are still being accepted for the Fall 2020 Diplomacy Lab , a U.S. State Department initiative where faculty and students can explore world problems and contribute to foreign policy. International Scholars: Worldwide visa issuance has been suspended, and start dates for new international personnel have been deferred to June 1, though this date will likely be extended. OIA continues to work closely with leadership at the university and school levels to coordinate plans for their scholars’ future arrival. Our international scholar services team also continues to process visa applications to secure work authorization for IUPUI’s international personnel who are already located in the U.S.< Sustainable partnerships: Now more than ever, OIA is committed to making the world a better place, and we are engaging with primary international university partners to consider research collaborations, curriculum exchange, study abroad, community engagement, and funding opportunities that are framed around the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The goal is not only to use the SDGs to anchor international partnerships and consortia but to use the SDGs to introduce interdisciplinary global problem-solving and community engagement in coursework and research agendas. If you are interested in joining a group to further this important work, please contact Ian McIntosh While this is clearly unsteady terrain, and our international mobility will likely be curtailed for some time, our commitment to internationalization at IUPUI has never been firmer. I send you all my deepest gratitude for your partnership, support, and confidence in the potential of a global education. Hilary E.

Kahn Dear Friends of OIA, These are challenging times. We are in the midst of an extremely high-stake election. We are fully immersed in a global pandemic that has altered every aspect of our personal lives, our professional identities and practices, and our plans for the future. Every week it seems we encounter new restrictions on the free movement of people and ideas across borders. On top of all this, we are reckoning with legacies of social injustice, pronounced inequities around economic and food security, and debilitating fear and frustration about the uncertainties and instabilities that have become the norm for many. The Office of International Affairs is committed to supporting staff, students, partners, and faculty during these uncharted times. We are particularly cognizant of the current needs of our international students, many of whom are experiencing this turbulence thousands of miles away from home. It is hard enough looking to the horizon for those of us who are lucky to be near family, but it is exponentially more difficult for international students who may be far from home, uncertain about when they will next see their families and friends, and without access to various resources and financial support. International students, like many others, have severe financial needs during this time, due to reduced access to employment in the U.S. and economic instability at home. Fortunately, the campus allocates funds to support IUPUI’s international students through periods of unexpected financial hardship, but funds are being depleted at an unprecedented rate. If you are able to support these efforts, your contributions to the IUPUI International Student Scholarship Fund will help make IUPUI a more supportive, welcoming, and assuredly global institution for all. We thank for your support to our work, and we send you our warmest wishes to you and yours as we get through these countless challenges together. Global. Local. Better Together. All best, Hilary E.

Following the deeply concerning fall of Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, in August 2021, IUPUI, IU, and Hoosiers alike have been offering our support to our international students, scholars, and community affected by the crisis, as well as coordinating with local organizations to help support Afghan refugees to Indiana. More recently, IUPUI has offered support by leading a group of students to volunteer with Exodus Refugee as part of the 2022 International Festival's Day of Service, joining Welcome.US' \"Welcome Campus Network ,\" and establishing the Taskforce on Refugee Community Support in January 2022 to assist with the influx of Afghan refugees as well as other existing and future refugee populations. The taskforce will consider how IUPUI can proactively build a stronger infrastructure for refugee students, scholars, families, and communities through managing timely and appropriate communications and outreach, navigating enrollment processes and current local and federal policies, and offering solutions to educational barriers, such as financial need and language training. The taskforce meets monthly.

The SDGs build on decades of work by countries across the world and the United Nations, which today provides substantive support, tracks progress, and builds capacity towards achieving the Goals. In collaboration with the Office of Sustainability, the Office of International Affairs has been working towards advancing the SDGs at IUPUI for the last few years by taking a whole of school approach – our 17 Schools towards the 17 Goals – positioning them at the cornerstone of our internationalization efforts and allowing them to serve as a framework that helps us navigate the global and local aspects of the 5 P’s – People, Planet, Prosperity, Peace, and Partnership. IUPUI’s preeminence in addressing the SDGs is reflected in a new campus-wide website , which showcases the university'scommitment; highlights IUPUI faculty, staff, students, and scholars working on global and local sustainability issues; and offers ways in which you can take action to make the world a better place for all. In April 2021, our efforts were recognized in a big way by the Times Higher Education (THE) Impact Rankings , where IUPUI ranked 2nd in the United States and 28th in the world for our work around the SDGs. Last month, after several months of delay due to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns, we finally had the opportunity to come together as a campus to celebrate this achievement on February 17th. The 2022 IUPUI International Festival was the venue, with our SDG Day celebration serving as a highlight amongst the week’s festivities, which included sessions encouraging our global community to explore love across the world, prepare for a global career, and volunteer their time to support local non-profit Exodus Refugee. This year’s International Festival, to our team’s pride and delight, was also the largest Certified Green Event in IUPUI’s history, with the Campus Center running on 100% renewable energy the entire week! City of Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett kicked off the celebration, officially proclaiming February 17, 2022 “IUPUI United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Day,” acknowledging our campus’ work towards advancing this important agenda and recognizing changemakers across our university as they continue to make a difference at IUPUI, in our community, and beyond. Amongst those recognized more distinctly was Dr. Jessica Davis, Director of IUPUI’s Office of Sustainability, who received an SDG Pacesetter Award from Dr. Kathy Marrs, Associate Dean of the IUPUI Honors College, for her outstanding contribution towards these and other sustainability efforts across our campus. Beloved outgoing Chancellor Nasser Paydar was also recognized for his contribution and dedication to sustainability and the SDGs across campus. The event continued by bringing together the rest of our outstanding SDG leaders, an unprecedented sampling of 17+ speakers from all across the campus, who truly breathed life into our SDG motto, “17 for 17” – 17 Schools for 17 Goals. The speakers, which came from as diverse backgrounds as their differing areas of study, articulated how their research advanced one or several SDGs. Highlights from the event, which was made possible by a grant from the IUPUI Welcoming Campus Initiative , included: Dr. Jim Cleary of the IU Simon Cancer Center, who worked with Mother Theresa in Calcutta in his youth and has dedicated his life to palliative care. Cleary spoke on the unequal access to pain-relieving opioids around the world, connecting to SDG 3, Good Health and Wellbeing. Addressing the need for new drugs for the world’s neglected diseases, Dr. Bill Scott from the School of Science’s Department of Chemistry spoke about the methodology called “Distributed Drug Discovery,” or “D3” for short, which involves partnering for a common cause with faculty and staff from universities around the globe and connects to SDG 3, Good Health and Wellbeing, and SDG 17, Partnerships for the Goals. Dr. Albert William from the School of Informatics and Computing, along with an international team, showcased a short cartoon they developed on plastic pollution in our oceans featuring “Mr. Bubbles” to bring attention to SDG 14, Life Below Water. By 2050, the traditional means by which the world manufactures protein for consumption will be unsustainable. Dr. Christine Picard of the School of Science is at the forefront of research on insects as a source of protein for both humans and animals, connecting to SDG 1, No Poverty, and SDG 2, Zero Hunger. Dr. Khaula Murtadha, Vice Chancellor of IUPUI Family, School, and Neighborhood Engagement, spoke about the importance of community-engaged action research on the SDGs and the dissemination of findings in a new journal called “Engage!,” touching on all of the SDGs. And finally – representing SDG 13, Climate Action, and the Office of International Affairs – Study Abroad Director Stephanie Leslie spoke about our office’s “Green Team,” who pioneer sustainable practices across our office and outreach, including switching to 100% recyclable paper last year and leading the creation of IUPUI’s Green Travel Guide by intern Gracie Lyons to assist our faculty, staff, and students going abroad to make better choices for our planet.

The SDGs, which consist of a collection of 17 global calls to action that if answered will lead to a better world for all, serve as the cornerstone of the IUPUI Office of International Affairs’ (OIA) comprehensive internationalization efforts, facilitating partnerships across all schools, departments, and units within IUPUI and beyond. In collaboration with the IUPUI Office of Sustainability, OIA has been working to approach the SDGs through a “whole of school” approach for the last few years, bringing all 17 schools within the university on board to tackle the 17 goals – 17 for 17 – allowing them to serve as a framework when navigating the local and global aspects of the 5 P’s – People, Planet, Prosperity, Peace, and Partnership. “In a time where the interconnectivity of the world is increasingly being recognized as a reality, our ability to be collaborative and interdisciplinary while addressing both local and global challenges makes IUPUI not just an outstanding place for education, but a leader for innovation across Indiana and the world,” said Hilary Kahn, Associate Vice Chancellor for International Affairs at IUPUI and Associate Vice President for International Affairs at Indiana University. IUPUI submitted its achievements for nine of the 17 SDGs this year – #3 Good Health and Wellbeing; #4 Quality Education; #5 Gender Equality; #7 Affordable and Clean Energy; #8 Decent Work and Economic Growth; #10 Reduced Inequalities; #13 Climate Action; #16 Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions; and #17 Partnerships for the Goals, which all universities must report on. Universities’ national and global scores are then based on their ranking in #17, as well as their top three highest ranked SDGs. “Higher education plays such a pivotal role in advancing the SDGs – through pioneering research, teaching the leaders of tomorrow, and working alongside communities to make positive changes for our planet. That’s why IUPUI is so proud of this achievement and why we continue to work with faculty, staff, students, and partners near and afar towards a more sustainable and equitable world for all,” said Jessica Davis, Director of IUPUI Office of Sustainability. IUPUI ranked highest in SDGs #3, #5, #10, #16 and #17, ranking 3 rd , 4 th , 3 rd , 4 th , and 4 th nationally respectively and within the Top 10% internationally across the board. Some of these are the most reported on SDGs within the rankings, meaning that even against the stiffest competition IUPUI continues to lead the way on Good Health and Wellbeing; Gender Equality; Reduced Inequalities; Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions; and Partnership for the Goals. These high-achieving SDGs also highlight the numerous areas IUPUI is making an impact locally – with partnerships like the McKinney School of Law’s Civil Practice Clinic (CPC) and Re-entry Assistance and Community Help (REACH) Clinic – as well as nationally and globally with initiatives such as the IU Center for Global Health and AMPATH and Lugar Center for Renewable Energy .

Coinciding with this publication, various IUPUI offices and organizations are engaged in greening initiatives to offset the sizable carbon footprint that comes with domestic and international travel. Recently, for example, as part of a united effort to raise consciousness on sustainable travel, native trees were planted on the IUPUI campus by representatives of a range of schools and centers, including O’Neill, Herron, Honors, Health and Human Sciences, the Offices of International Affairs and Sustainability, and the Center for Renewable Energy. QR codes linked to educational information on the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) were affixed to signs in order to promote awareness of sustainable practices. In addition, the Herron School of Art called upon student artists to create their own vision of a sustainable future, offering a prize for the best submission. As Herron professor Stefan Petranek said: “Engaging artists opens up new pathways to address complex patterns of behavior in society that can motivate us to face some of our mightiest challenges.” Eight finalists were selected for unveiling at the tree planting event, and the People’s Choice Award went to Herron student Sarah Laudadio for her composition “Plastic Weed.” In the next stage of promotion for green travel, the artwork will rotate to different venues on campus. The first exhibit was at the International Festival on February 14, 2023. The OIA is the current destination for March 2023!

This study in the Sarapiqui area of Costa Rica in partnership with the National University of Costa Rica, is guided by the Sustainable Livelihood Framework, a theoretical framework that critically evaluates the contribution of a development method to various community assets. Dr. Liu-Lastres’ study will (1) explore if justice and equity of the residents are considerations in an emerging destination development plan and (2) develop and test a collaborative, sustainable tourism development model for CBT. Les Etienne , Center for Africana Studies and Culture; Eric Kyere , School of Social Work; Patricia Turley , Africana Studies The Digital Humanities project ‘Echoes in the Africana World’ is designed to engage a transnational cohort of persons of African descent (Brazil, Barbados, Ghana, Alabama and IUPUI) in dispelling distortions about Africana culture, identity, and history as they relate to the lives of Black undergraduate students who face daily challenges in their place in the world. This project will advance SDG’s #10 Reduced Inequalities and #16 Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions. Through this transnational engagement, we seek to strengthen relevant institutions for building capacities to educate persons of African descent to take on the challenge of reducing inequalities within their own contexts, thereby contributing to a more just and equitable world. 2023 OIA SDG Grant Recipients Matthew Hume, Director of International Programs, International Center for Intercultural Communication (ICIC) Recognizing the growing importance of the role that academic oral and written English assumes in STEM higher education in Kazakhstan, and its implicit role in conducting environmental business in an English as a lingua franca world, ICIC has been invited by our scholarly partners at Toraighyrov to lead IUPUI’s involvement in an Academic Writing in STEM Conference to be held at Toraighyrov University, Pavlodar. The conference will lead to increased awareness of the role STEM and English instructors play in preparing the emerging generation of scholars and researchers to take action, using English as a lingua franca, towards advancing UN SDGs such as Goal 7, Affordable and Clean Energy, and Goal 13, Climate Change.

The goal of this research is to enable the applicant to work with institutional partners to develop a viable application for the Spencer Foundation Large Research Grants on Education Program with the goal of assessing learning objectives(LOs), strengthening, and collaborating to enhance and improve social justice education and implementation at IUPUI. Amanda Cecil, Director of Graduate Programs, Department of Tourism, Event, and Sport Management, School of Health & Human Sciences The tourism and travel industries are eager to return to pre-pandemic tourist numbers. The young generations, specifically Gen Y and Z, play an important role in the tourism market and often assume a sustainable mindset. In turn, sustainable tourism development and \"green\" travel practices are increasingly necessary. The main purpose of this study is to develop a conceptual framework to understand and compare the young generations' attitudes and behaviors related to sustainable travel, with a specific focus on their sustainable travel motivations. The results of this study can be used in many interdisciplinary fields of study and generate conversation in multiple disciples (i.e., sociology, business marketing, consumer behavior, sustainability and tourism). The intent is also to provide suggestions for destinations to promote sustainable travel best practices and encourage more travelers to make intentional, sustainable choices. Tina O’Neal, Clinical Assistant Professor, IUPUI School of Education In her exploration of special education in Ghana, Dr. O’Neal will review the need for sustainable program evaluations projects to monitor the access of students with disabilities to the general education classroom, their transition to and participation rate in secondary education, and their transition from school to work.

IPMP played a huge role in my academic and social life on campus as a student who had just moved to a new campus. With such a short but strong connection with IPMP, I could not have dreamed of a better opportunity to get involved in campus life. This is why I joined the IPMP in May to be part of the community to help international students. IPMP has become my family over the year. I improved my intercultural communication skills while mentoring 12 different students and collaborating with diverse groups of mentors. The IPMP provided me with social connections and networking opportunities, and most importantly valuable leadership opportunities.\" Brian Cheong Computer Engineering, Minor in Computer Science and Mathematics \"As an international student from Malaysia who started my university life during peak Covid season, I was not able to attend classes in person and even had to stay in Malaysia for my first semester with a 12 hours time zone difference. Fortunately, I decided to be a part of IPMP as a mentee and met a group of amazing mentors. We would connect with each other and organize fun online events to lighten up the mood despite us having our own problems to deal with at that time. Aside from that, I also got a lot of advice from my mentors about getting involved on campus. That was when I started leaving my footprints at different parts of campus, contributing to the betterment of the IUPUI community, and still wanting to do more. Besides my on campus involvements, I was also able to make good connections with a diverse group of peers, some of which are also international students from different parts of the world. We would study and go on trips together, keeping each other accompanied, and that gave me the motivation to excel both academically and personally at IUPUI.\" Luke Dennison Accounting and Finance \"Global learning has contributed to my IUPUI experience by providing me with the opportunity to experience new cultures on a first-hand basis. It taught me how international commerce is conducted, as well as the salience of history and tradition. I am incredibly blessed and grateful to have studied abroad in London, and it is an experience that I will never forget.\" Alston Dsouza Electrical Engineering, Minors in Computer Science and Mathematics \"Global learning has been one of the main contributors to my collegiate success at IUPUI. Now as I recall, most of my close friends come from all parts of the globe like Turkey, Uzbekistan, Russia, Jordan, Nigeria, Japan, Malaysia, Brazil, Spain, Honduras, etc., My friends have exposed me to their beautiful cultural heritage, their food, their ways of living, TV shows, etc., and ultimately made me aware of the fact that we live in a humongous world and how each person and their traditions are unique respectively. Global learning has helped me learn how to be inclusive; tending to the different needs of people while also teaching me to be open-minded to different beliefs and traditions that people bring along. Being exposed to different people has definitely taught me to be a better communicator, a better leader, and also a better student in my engineering journey at IUPUI.\" Anna Marie Greenfield Sports Management, Business, and Event Management, Minor in Dance \"The opportunity to participate in a Global Learning experience has had a large impact on my IUPUI experience. In my opinion, there’s no better way to learn about something than through hands-on experience, which is exactly what the Cruise-Line study abroad opportunity provided. Getting to experience life on a cruise ship for a week gave me a whole new perspective on the events and hospitality world that I can now take back and apply to events here in Indianapolis. In addition to the educational portion, Global Learning opportunities provide an amazing and unique way to connect with other students. I never would’ve met some of the people in my class had it not been for this opportunity and I’m thankful to have created many close friendships. All students should participate in at least one Global Learning experience if they have the chance to!\" Naga Sai Adithya Kandru Electrical Engineering, Economics, Minor in Mathematics \"Global Learning has been a critical component of my IUPUI experience. I have had the opportunity to learn to work effectively across cultures, understand different communication styles, and respect cultural norms. The IPMP program and my time at the OIA have provided me with the opportunity to develop skills and competencies that are highly valued by employers, such as adaptability, critical thinking, and intercultural competence which will be very important for my future career.\" Harsimran Kaur Biology, Honors minor in Leadership \"I am beyond grateful for the opportunity to participate in Global Learning at IUPUI. Through my Global Learning experience, I had the chance to engage with individuals from various backgrounds in the Dominican Republic. During my time studying abroad, I learned about the relationship and history between the Dominican Republic and Haiti, and had the opportunity to contribute to building houses for communities and learn about the medical system in the DR, which were significantly meaningful experiences for me. Interacting with different people and communities allowed me to appreciate diverse cultures and ways of life. I believe this exposure has helped me grow personally and become more open-minded. Participating in the Global Learning program also provided me with a platform to develop critical skills such as independence, adaptability, and problem-solving. These experiences allowed me to navigate unfamiliar environments and confront challenges with confidence, resulting in my personal growth. I am grateful for this opportunity because it has provided me with so much. I returned with a deeper understanding of the world and my place in it.\" Kayla Mae Lemmon Business Management, Minor in Philanthropic Studies \"Global Learning contributed to my IUPUI experience by increasing my awareness of the world around me. I was able to make connections, learn a language, try new foods, and get out of my comfort zone. This experience was incredible, and changed my world view. I am more intentional and moderate now that I have returned. Ultimately, my trip helped me realize the true meaning of \"Pura Vida\".\" Hope Leonard Music Technology, Psychology \"I cannot separate my IUPUI experience and my Global Learning experience - they are one and the same! My time as an International Peer Mentor and my service coordinating the International Peer Mentoring Program as Coordinator has been most joyous. I am proud of the teamwork and servant leadership that I have been a part of and these experiences have shaped who I am. I consider myself blessed to have had the interactions with students and staff that have been fostered by Global Learning.\" Ashw in Manoj Mechanical Engineering, Minors in Computer Science, Mathematics \"Global learning has been an instrumental part of my time at IUPUI and I have enjoyed every moment of it. I studied abroad in Germany, interned in South Africa, and worked extensively with the OIA. I have had the opportunity to meet unique individuals from new cultures and this has helped me develop new respect for internationalism. And learning from professors from various backgrounds has added diversity to my thought-processes and problem solving skills. I am grateful for the global learning opportunities that IUPUI has presented and I hope to keep learning more about the beautiful world we live in.\" Carson Grace Prosser Neuroscience \"While I was abroad, I learned so much more about myself and the world around me. I learned that broadening my perspective would help me to connect with more people on a deeper level and enhance my own understanding of the world. I learned to take risks and put myself out of my comfort zone, because while I might risk vulnerability or embarrassment, I might also make great memories and long-lasting friendships. Another unique experience was learning about the field of neuroscience from the perspective of other cultures, which helped to broaden my own perspective of neurological research. It is extremely important to approach science from different angles and perspectives, so learning from professors of other cultures who have different ideas and methods of analyzing research is helpful to broaden my thinking as a future neuroscientist. I am so grateful that I had the opportunity to study abroad, and that I could bring all the lessons I learned back to IUPUI. This university has provided me with a unique and enriching experience which challenged me and taught me many important lessons. Studying abroad forced me to step out of my comfort zone and learn more about myself and the world around me which helped me to gain the confidence that has been essential to my success as a student, teacher, and leader for IUPUI.\" Catherine Elizabeth Sellmer Psychology \"Wow! Studying abroad was always my dream, and I thought I wouldn't be able to due to COVID. I found the program I wanted to do before even being accepted to IUPUI, and my heart was set on it. I remember the day I got accepted. I was so elated and couldn't believe that I was going to study food and culture in Greece! I have an interest in studying nutrition because my career aspiration is to become an eating disorder therapist. Being in Greece gave me inspiration to do eating disorder research there, since there is only one published study on this. Being abroad allowed me to further my studies and embrace different cultures.\" Dhriti Shah Accounting and Finance \"Being an international student, and having the opportunity to go on a Study Abroad trip to London, I am extremely grateful for the experiences that have shaped me to be the person that I am today and the person that I strive to be. I have gained a new perspective which has helped me to be even more dedicated towards my education. I could not have imagined a better experience for myself at IUPUI, and for that I will always be extremely grateful.\" Kiera Avenal Sloan Marketing, International Business, Spanish \"Global Learning has contributed to IUPUI experience more so that I ever thought possible. I knew that leaving the country and taking classes in Spanish would elevate my languages skills, but, the personal growth and broadening of my own horizons is something I never expected to see so prominently in my four months in Spain. I value people and their various ways of contributing to society so much more deeply, and this maturing of this thought will carry with me in my final year at IUPUI. I feel as though experiencing life outside the confinements of my day-to-day Indianapolis routine has bettered equipped me to contribute to our Jaguar community and in work after my time in education.\" Gabriella Soto Health Services Management \"The opportunity to Study Abroad allowed me to apply what I have learned throughout my time at IUPUI and prepared me for my experiences while abroad. This past spring break I had the privilege to visit London, England to learn and explore their healthcare system. I was able to gain an understanding of the National Health Service (NHS) from various perspectives while also having time to explore the city in our free time. As a recipient of the Study Abroad Planning Grant, I was able to apply the grant to cover a large portion of the program cost. This program may not have been possible without the Planning Grant. I had the privilege of not only exploring their healthcare system but also gaining an understanding of their culture and history. This experience allowed me to broaden my perspective on what could be possible here in the U.S. and in my own life as well.\" Zhen Hong Tan Electrical Engineering, Quantitative Economics, Minors in Mathematics and Global and International Studies \"My favorite part about studying at IUPUI is its diversity. There are people from all walks of life here, which I think is cool because everyone has something unique to offer. Adjusting to life in Indianapolis was pretty easy for me because the people here are friendly and welcoming. It made it easier for me to feel comfortable around them right away. Melissa Ruth Thomas Public Health and English, Minor in Health Communication \"Global Learning has allowed me to expand my worldview beyond my coursework, and to return to campus with new ideas to directly apply towards my education and the community. I have been able to connect with multiple faculty members and students of IUPUI, as well as establish other fantastic working relationships across campuses and across borders.\" Ria Vavhal Visual Communication Design \"As an international student, global learning has been a part and parcel of my journey at IUPUI and through my involvement with the Office of International Affairs.

It thus has been extremely difficult to witness the escalating anti-Asian sentiment and violence directed toward Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, and Asians in the United States and elsewhere. Regrettably, discrimination toward Asians is not new, but it has been exacerbated during the pandemic, and this week’s tragic murders of six women of Asian descent in Atlanta brings this situation again to the forefront. While the motives of this violence are being investigated and debated, this tragedy clearly strikes at the intersections of race, gender, power, and class. Whether overt or not, it was violence toward a marginalized population and related to deep societal inequalities, and it occurred during heightened expression of anti-Asian sentiment in the United States. The Office of International Affairs therefore reaffirms its commitment to making the world a better and more inclusive and just place. We stand firmly and in solidarity with everyone, everywhere, who fights against discrimination, prejudice, and social injustice. We solidly support all Asians and Asian Americans in the IUPUI community today and always. We stand tall with the sustained fight against institutionalized racism and violence against Black and Brown communities in the United States. We repudiate Islamophobia and all forms of xenophobia. We stand in unity with all who contribute to our diverse campus, including the thousands of individuals from over 140 countries, from China to Mexico, from Burma to Nigeria, and from India to Saudi Arabia, regardless of citizenship status. As always, we ask the IUPUI community to be mindful of any discriminatory action or incident of racial bias. As Chancellor Paydar reaffirmed yesterday , IUPUI does not accept discrimination in any form, so please report any such occurrence here . Racism is, and always has been, a global issue, and the Office of International Affairs will not ever waver in our commitment to our global and inclusive campus and community. Global. Local. Better Together. Respectfully, Hilary E. Kahn, Ph.D. Associate Vice Chancellor for International Affairs, IUPUI Associate Vice President for International Affairs, Indiana University Associate Professor of Anthropology, IUPUI IU Bicentennial Professor 2019-2021 3/19/21 - 11:55 am edit: Minor text update in the first paragraph.

Ian McIntosh, author of “Between Two Worlds: Essays in Honour of the Visionary Aboriginal Elder, David Burrumarra,” (left) and Gil Latz, author of “Rediscovering Shibusawa Eiichi in the 21st Century” (right) In \"Between Two Worlds: Essays in Honour of the Visionary Aboriginal Elder, David Burrumarra,” McIntosh examines the life and impact of Australian Aboriginal leader David Burrumarra M.B.E. (1917-1994). Burrumarra was a staunch advocate of Aboriginal rights, particularly influencing north-east Arnhem Land community development during the mid to late twentieth century. McIntosh was a close friend and student of Burrumarra and the book includes more than thirty essays about Burrumarra’s life and continuing influence even today as Australia’s Aboriginal peoples continue with their struggle for land and sea rights and reconciliation. This tribute volume – many years in the making – is intended to help connect contemporary Aboriginal youth with the worldviews that sustained Burrumarra’s clan since ancient times but which are now largely inaccessible,” said McIntosh. “Rather than have these stories ‘disappear beneath the earth’, it was Burrumarra’s wish that they continue to inspire and animate new lives, both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal.” A new book edited by Gil Latz examines the life and continuing impact of Shibusawa Eiichi (1840-1931). Shibusawa, often referred to as the father of Japanese capitalism, was a key figure in Japan’s development as an industrial country and in the fields of entrepreneurship and philanthropy. “Rediscovering Shibusawa Eiichi in the 21st Century” uncovers Eiichi’s modern day impact, particularly through the activities of the Shibusawa Eiichi Memorial Foundation over the past fifteen years. As Japan enters the twenty-first century, this book underscores how recent history can address contemporary questions such as balancing democratic values, citizenship and civil society, and Japan’s place in world affairs. Included are discussions of the Foundation’s international publications, conferences, and special museum exhibitions, as well as the establishment of a unique center gathering historical resource material on entrepreneurship, and digitization of an immense archive of Eiichi’s life and thought. About the Authors Ian McIntosh is the Director of International Partnerships at IUPUI. He is the former Managing Director of Cultural Survival, one of the world’s foremost organizations promoting the rights, voices and visions of indigenous peoples. McIntosh has written three books and over 100 articles on indigenous themes, and is a co-founder of Past Masters International. He regularly teaches courses at IUPUI on truth and reconciliation. Gil Latz is Associate Vice Chancellor for International Affairs and Professor of Geography at IUPUI, and Associate Vice President for International Affairs and professor of Philanthropic Studies at Indiana University. His research and publications have focused on: the internationalization of higher education in the US and Asia; and regional development and resource management policy in East Asia, North America and Europe. Latz also conducts research on Japan’s modernization process in terms of the role played by philanthropy and civic leadership.

The U.S. government has indicated that the flexibility for online classes will continue for the fall 2022 and spring 2023 terms. F-1 students Most classes will be in-person, but some academic programs may offer hybrid or online course enrollment. Thus, F-1 students at IUPUI continue to fall under the Department of Homeland Security's immigration guidance related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This means that if you arrived on campus for Fall 2022 or earlier, you are permitted to enroll in only online courses for Spring 2023 from a regulatory perspective. However, your academic program determines what course types are available for your enrollment, and you need to work with them to determine if you have an option for online study. If you are a new student for spring 2023, you need to enroll in at least one in-person class (coded as P, HY, IN, or IS on class schedules). Regardless of whether you are online or in-person, you need to meet all appropriate immigration status requirements . Our office is available to help in case you have any visa- or travel-related questions. You should direct other questions to your department. J-1 students J-1 students need to enroll in at least one in-person class (coded as P, HY, IN, or IS on class schedules), but be prepared to adjust to a pre-pandemic, standard enrollment if Department of State changes its guidance. Planning for fall 2023 and beyond We expect the flexibility the U.S. government has provided so far to end after summer 2023. So, you should plan for a return to normal immigration regulations regarding online enrollment in fall 2023 and beyond. Travel Can I travel outside the U.S.? If you are currently in the U.S. and want to travel outside the country, you should carefully consider your return travel. Will you be able to travel back to the U.S. in time for any in-person class requirements? Are you fully vaccinated against COVID-19? Do you need a new visa to return to the U.S. (appointment backlogs at U.S. embassies and consulates continue to be an issue)? And of course, you’d need to follow any travel/quarantine guidance for the countries you plan to visit. Make sure you review the other questions in this Travel section. If I leave the U.S., what documents do I need to take with me? Signed I-20 (F-1 students) or DS-2019 (J-1 students) Passport Print and keep a copy of your most recent I-94 Save evidence of your departure from the U.S. (boarding passes, copies of stamps in your passport) Additional information for current students You need to submit a Travel Signature Request eform in Atlas if one of these is true for you: The most recent travel signature (endorsement) on your I-20 or DS-2019 is going to be older than 12 months from the date you plan to reenter the U.S. in the same program of study You are an undergraduate student with a new major I want to enter the U.S.; what do I need to know? For new students in Fall 2022, you will need to enroll in at least one class that has an in-person component. Effective November 8, 2021, all nonimmigrant, non-citizen individuals entering the U.S. will be required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. There are some very limited exceptions. Review the vaccine/testing requirement Documents to carry with you We recommend you carry the following documents with you, and present them to the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agent. I-20 or DS-2019 (for F-1 or J-1 students), with a valid travel signature Valid F-1 or J-1 visa stamp Passport valid for at least six months from your planned entry date We recommend that you carry the following with you in your carry-on luggage but only present them to the CBP agent if requested. A copy of your current or next semester class schedule Additional information for current students You need to submit a Travel Signature Request eform in Atlas if one of these is true for you: Themost recent travel signature on your I-20 or DS-2019 is going to be older than 12 months from the date you plan to reenter the U.S. in the same program of study You are an undergraduate student with a new major After you arrive in the U.S. Find your I-94 record and upload it to Atlas. You need to do this every time you enter the U.S. Visas and Immigration Our office is your primary resource for these questions. The advice we provide one student doesn't always apply to the next student. So you need to contact us if you have questions about your situation instead of following advice from a friend or something you found on social media. Do I have to remain in Indianapolis or the U.S. while I'm taking classes? Yes, if you are a new F-1 student in the U.S. for fall 2022 OR a new or continuing J-1 student This means that you are arriving for in-person classes for the first time in Fall 2022. You need to remain in Bloomington and participate in at least one in-person class (coded as P, HY, IN, or IS on your class schedule). Otherwise, it is up to your academic department, and you should contact them with any questions. What about the \"5-month rule\"? The 5-month rule does not apply in this situation. As long as you maintain full time enrollment in your IUPUI classes, you are considered in valid status. What if my visa is expired and I need a new visa? Look to be sure that your visa stamp is truly expired. This is the sticker in your passport, given to you by the U.S. Embassy or Consulate. It is only possible to get a new visa stamp at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate outside of the U.S. If you are outside of the U.S., and your visa stamp is expired, you will need to apply for a new visa stamp at the U.S. Embassy or Consulate. You do not need to leave the U.S. if your visa stamp is expired. The visa stamp in your passport only needs to be valid to seek re-entry to the U.S. If you are in the U.S. and remain in the U.S. with an expired visa stamp, you do not need to take any action to get a new visa. You may do so on a future trip outside of the U.S. Can I extend my F-1 or J-1 student status? You may have heard that you can file Form I-539 to extend your stay in the U.S. as an F-1 or J-1 student, but that is generally not true for F-1 and J-1 students at IUPUI . It is always best to contact our office with any questions related to your immigration status instead of relying on information you’ve heard from others. Generally speaking, your F-1 or J-1 student status is valid (as long as you follow applicable rules for F-1 students and J-1 students ) until you complete your program end date (plus the additional time for your grace period, which is 60 days for F-1 students and 30 days for J-1 students). If you wish to extend your stay in the U.S. beyond the end of your grace period, you only have a few options (learn more for F-1 students and J-1 students ). The U.S. government has not provided any additional grace period benefits because of COVID-19. If you are unable to leave the U.S. or extend your stay through employment authorization or further academic study by the end of your grace period, you need to speak to an experienced immigration attorney to discuss your options. An attorney may be able to identify a non-student immigration status that you can apply for. You can find an immigration lawyer through the American Immigration Lawyers Association . Our office cannot assist you with an application to change to a non-student status. I heard that you can send my I-20 or DS-2019 by email; is that true? Yes, we can provide an electronic copy of your signed I-20. Effective Fall 2021, we will only be providing electronic I-20s unless you specifically request a printed I-20. It is not an option for the DS-2019 because the Department of State's Exchange Visitor Program, which governs the J-1 program, has stated that an electronic Form DS-2019 is not permissible. If I choose to take a semester off, what should I know? Contact our office to discuss taking a semester off. There are multiple things to consider, and we can help you work through that process. Immigration considerations Review our leave of absence website for F-1 students and J-1 students . If you choose to not enroll in classes for a semester, we would need to end your current SEVIS record, which has some important consequences. You would have to leave the U.S. (if you are in the country). You would not be able to reenter the U.S. as an F-1 or J-1 student until you have a new I-20 or DS-2019 and have paid the SEVIS fee (currently $350 USD for F-1 students and $220 USD for J-1 students) again. You would not be eligible for off-campus work authorization (CPT or OPT) until you have completed a full academic year in the U.S. For example, if you returned in fall 2021, you would not be able to hold an off-campus internship until the fall 2022 semester. If you only need one semester to complete your program, you would not be eligible for CPT or OPT for that degree program. If you choose to do so, complete the Notification of Complete Withdrawal from Classes eform in Atlas before the first day of classes. Then, you need to contact us at least three months before the semester you plan to return to IUPUI. If I am approved for a reduced course load, can I remain in status by taking online classes? If have already been approved for a Reduced Course Load, you are considered to be a full-time student—even if you are enrolled in fewer courses than is typically considered full-time. The update to the academic calendar does not change your approval. If you have concerns about your enrollment, please contact your academic advisor and the OIA . If I become ill and am unable to participate in class, what should I do? If you are ill for several days and unable to participate in online class, contact us to discuss the immigration options you have. You may have an option to withdraw for a medical reason , and we would be able to assist you with that process. If you are on an IU-sponsored medical insurance plan, you will not have to pay any out-of-pocket expenses for the focused test used to diagnose COVID-19. Any treatment related to the illness would have the same coverage that is currently available for any emergency or non-emergency illness (subject to the normal deductible, copay, or out-of-pocket amounts associated with your medical plan). Review the Anthem plan details for specific information or contact the IU Student Health Insurance Coordinator if you have questions about your coverage. If I can't return to Indianapolis; what should I do? You should contact your academic department for help. When will I be eligible for CPT/OPT because of COVID-19? The U.S. government has not updated the regulations related to Curricular Practical Training (CPT) and Optional Practical Training (OPT) due to COVID-19. Insurance Do I have to have health insurance if I'm outside the U.S.? The IU International Plan provides coverage anywhere in the world, so you can remain on it if you wish. F-1 Students: If you are in F-1 status and enrolled in IUPUI classes while outside the U.S., you will automatically be enrolled in the IU plan, but you are not required to keep it or have alternate health insurance coverage. Complete the Health Insurance Exemption Request in Atlas to indicate that you do not want insurance. When you return to the U.S.—even if it is in the middle of the semester—you need to have health insurance. Contact OIA to purchase special pro-rated coverage under the IU International Plan. J-1 Students: If you are maintaining your J-1 status while outside the U.S., you will be automatically enrolled in the IU plan.  You and your dependents are required by the U.S. Department of State to have health insurance that meets minimum coverage levels: $100,000 for each sickness or illness (including maternity/pregnancy care) $100,000 for each accident or injury $50,000 for medical evacuation $25,000 for repatriation $500 deductible or less If you do not want the IU International Plan, submit proof of your alternate health insurance coverage in the Health Insurance Exemption Request in Atlas. Do I have to pay the same fees if I am enrolled online outside of Indianapolis? The cost of tuition and fees are the same no matter where you live or what mode of instruction the classes are (online or in-person). Academics and classroom Most questions about academics will need to be addressed by your professors or academic department. IUPUI provides a VPN to all students but you will likely have access to many campus resources (Canvas, One.IU, etc.) without a VPN. Zoom has some restrictions in China, but there is a workaround so you can access Zoom from China . If you have questions or concerns, contact IU's University Information Technology Services (UITS) . Housing and dining Questions about on-campus housing and dining should be directed to those offices for the most up-to-date information. Housing Dining Definition of Common Terms F-1 visa stamp The F-1 visa stamp in your passport is just a stamp that you show at the U.S. border to ask to enter the U.S. in F-1 status. It has no purpose again unless you choose to travel outside the U.S. and want to apply again to re-enter the U.S. in F-1 status. It is not required to be valid to remain inside the U.S. in F-1 status; you do need a valid F-1 visa stamp to enter the U.S. Please note some U.S. embassy and consulates around the world may be closed or offering limited services as the COVID-19 challenges are global and not limited to the U.S., and an F-1 visa stamp can only be obtained at a U.S. embassy or consulate outside of the U.S. F-1 status Your F-1 status is what allows you to remain legally inside the U.S. and continue to remain in the U.S. even with an expired F-1 visa stamp. Your F-1 status is shown by your I-94 that indicates you’ve been granted F-1 status and you are admitted in F-1 status for “D/S”. “D/S” means duration of status. That means you can continue to remain inside the U.S. in F-1 status for as long as you have a valid I-20 and you are continuing to meet all of the F-1 status requirements . Otherwise, your F-1 status stay in the U.S. only ends once you’ve completed your study for the degree listed on your I-20 or until your OPT authorization ends. As you are on OPT, your F-1 status would remain valid as long as you continue to meet the F-1 status OPT requirements including working full-time in your field of study and reporting that employment. SEVIS record This is a record in the U.S. government’s SEVIS database. To maintain the SEVIS record, an F-1 student has to be maintaining all of the U.S. government’s F-1 status requirements, including the enrollment requirements. Please note the F-1 status requirements are not the requirements of the OIA or of IUPUI. They are the requirements of the U.S. government directly to each F-1 student in the U.S. If the F-1 status requirements cannot be maintained, this is a SEVIS violation and the SEVIS record has to be ended. If the SEVIS record is ended while an F-1 student is inside the U.S., this reflects that there is a problem with the student’s F-1 status in the U.S. If the SEVIS record is ended while the student is outside the U.S., a new SEVIS record has to be created before the student can return to the U.S. again in F-1 student status. I-20 The document created by the university’s Designated School Officials in the U.S. government’s SEVIS database. A valid I-20 is required to: apply at a U.S. embassy or consulate for an F-1 visa stamp; enter the U.S.; and to maintain F-1 status while inside the U.S. The I-20 is issued for a specific program of study for a specific length of time for study in that program. If a student is maintaining F-1 status requirements, the I-20 ends on the date the student completes the final academic requirements for the degree program listed on the I-20, even if that is earlier than the estimated program end date printed on the I-20. If a SEVIS record is ended, that also ends the validity of the I-20.

Kahn, Associate Vice Chancellor of International Affairs Dear Friends of OIA, Since becoming the Associate Vice Chancellor of International Affairs at IUPUI on September 1, every day I am in awe of IUPUI’s solid foundation for international initiatives. I am thoroughly enjoying the many conversations that I am having with a wide range of colleagues, and I am learning so much. I am also very proud of the superb OIA staff, all who are instrumental in furthering the international reach of our campus. Fortunately, there are many recent achievements, far too many to list here, that demonstrate that we are well on our way to making IUPUI an even more global and inclusive campus. For example, last year study abroad reached record participation, with 640 students studying abroad and 64 programs led by IUPUI faculty. Nine percent of the 2019 graduating class studied abroad! Also, in 2018-19, IUPUI awarded 579 degrees to international students , a record number, and our international scholar population grew by 9.5%, to another record of 728! This year, international enrollment in doctoral programs is up 10%, with a record number of 40 international students receiving PhD degrees. All international students and scholars are important to sustaining the vibrant global ethos and diversity on campus, and we thank them for making IUPUI home. I am also thrilled that we are completing the work on IUPUI’s Global Learning Outcomes, which are instrumental in assuring that all IUPUI students graduate with at least one significant international experience. Since I arrived, we have had various delegations from around the world and I am delighted to travel in November to visit an important partner, Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, China, with Chancellor Paydar and the deans from Engineering and Technology, Liberal Arts, and Science. Some of us will continue to Beijing afterwards to pursue new opportunities for IUPUI and its students, staff, and faculty to engage the world. The Office of International Affairs aims to advance internationalization at IUPUI in as many forms as possible and to be a critical resource for the entire campus. Whether you are a student, faculty, or staff, or whether you seek assistance with international admissions, global teaching and learning, study abroad, international student and scholar services, partnerships, or global research collaborations, we are here to serve you. It is an absolute honor to be working with you and the OIA team to assure that the people and practices of IUPUI are global, inclusive, and of superior quality, and that IUPUI continues to have profound impact within Indiana and beyond.

The Program for Intensive English (PIE), housed in the School of Liberal Arts, is administering the program. During the seven weeks, the students took courses in Interpersonal Communication and Advanced Academic English, a course designed to help non-native English speakers improve their academic writing. Students also audited a course in their field of study and participated in homestays with local families. The program is designed to help the students prepare to return to the U.S. in the future to successfully pursue graduate studies if they so choose. One such student is Tomás Lopez Cajaraville, a student from the town of Cañuelas, Argentina, who studies Geology at Buenos Aires University. “I am pleasantly surprised about the commitment showed at IUPUI to make our stay an unforgettable experience,” commented Cajaraville. He finds Indianapolis clean, welcoming and quiet—much quieter than major cities back home—but is surprised by its cultural and ethnic diversity. “One of the most impressive things at IUPUI is its cosmopolitan campus. I did not expect such an enormous amount of people from all around the world. This helps the university to have a cultural enrichment that is beneficial for all of us.” During his time at IUPUI, Cajaraville audited the “very dynamic” Global Cycles class with Dr. Gabriel Filippelli in the Department of Earth Sciences. He was also able to connect in the community with his other passion—the arts. “I had the unmeasurable pleasure of being hosted by people who love arts and support it in every possible manner, giving me the opportunity to know about the Indianapolis artistic production in music, dance, sculpture, and many other disciplines.” Each Friday during their time at IUPUI, students participated in cultural enrichment activities around the city. Trips to local museums (such as the Indiana State Museum, the Children’s Museum, and the Indianapolis Museum of Art at Newfields) offered insight into Indiana’s rich cultural heritage, and other excursions such as bowling and darts at Punch Bowl Social Club gave students the chance to experience the social side of Indianapolis. During the International Festival on February 14, Friends of Fulbright students held a booth to share about Argentine culture with festival attendees, while a trio of students performed songs on guitar. Another highlight of the program was a visit to the City-County building and Statehouse, during which the students had an opportunity to meet one-on-one with Mayor Joe Hogsett. Students and faculty in both the Latino Studies Program and the Spanish Program have graciously welcomed the Argentinian students and have been very helpful in serving as peer mentors during their time at IUPUI. “I have been thrilled to see the wonderful connections that the students in the Friends of Fulbright – Argentina program have been making across campus,” said Dr. Thom Upton, Director of the Program for Intensive English and Associate Dean for Faculty Affairs at the School of Liberal Arts. “I have talked with several of the faculty who have graciously welcomed the Argentinians into their classes, and all of them have been impressed with the students’ contributions and the intercultural perspectives that they bring to the class.” As he prepares to return to Buenos Aires, Cajaraville reflects on the lessons and insights he will bring back home. “Beyond academic learning, I believe that the biggest learning was to share this experience with people from another culture, but also with people from my own country that have completely different points of view. Furthermore, the experience of an international exchange brought several challenges that I had to face. It was a good training to have the possibility to face these challenges completely alone, far away from my family and friends, who always supported me from a distance,” he shared. “Now the task is basically to come back to my country, to tell my peers about this wonderful experience, but also to encourage more people to follow their dreams as I did.” The Friends of Fulbright Argentinian group will present about Argentine culture at the International Club’s Culture Hour on Friday, February 23 at 4:30 PM in UC 104.

Virtual exchange is one strategy that faculty and student affairs professionals can use to create global learning opportunities for students. Virtual exchange will be an important component of IUPUI reaching the goal of providing global learning experiences for all students. This article highlights the Office of International Affairs’ history in this area, provides an overview of virtual exchange, and shares how three IUPUI schools have recently leveraged virtual exchange to help students develop a global mindset and gain international perspectives in their discipline. IUPUI’s history with virtual exchange The Office of International Affairs has been encouraging and supporting the implementation of technology-enhanced global learning for more than two decades. In 2006, IUPUI hosted the Interactive Video for International Education Conference (IVIE). Funded in part through NAFSA: Association of International Educators, IVIE addressed the pedagogical, curricular, and social considerations of using technology to facilitate international education. Since 2016, OIA has encouraged the collaborative strategy called “virtual exchange”, providing professional development in this area, and actively seeking to broker partnerships between IUPUI faculty and staff and counterparts at international institutions. OIA’s Global Crossroads Classroom has been a primary tool in connecting students, faculty, and staff to international peers and colleagues. This video-conferencing enabled facility was one resource that enabled IUPUI to become a recognized leader in comprehensive campus internationalization. In addition to offering the Global Crossroads Classroom, OIA’s positions of director of curriculum internationalization and logistics and technology coordinator have provided guidance and support to faculty who seek to develop a virtual exchange. What is virtual exchange? Online intercultural exchange. Global Classroom. COIL. These are some of the terms used in the higher education community to refer to methods and approaches for integrating virtual exchange. Ultimately, they all have transcending borders through technology to facilitate intercultural learning, comparative disciplinary learning, interdisciplinary learning, and global problem solving as goals. Videoconferencing is a tool used to implement synchronous international engagement in and outside of the classroom. Virtual exchange, like curriculum internationalization, can manifest in different levels of complexity. Organizing an international videoconference that happens once or twice a semester can be a rich and valuable activity for facilitating intercultural learning between students during a class session. With an international partner, faculty can also collaboratively design a module or course in which students in different countries use technology (in and outside of class) to work together over time on a shared project that can yield high quality engaged global learning. For virtual exchange to have the highest impact for all involved, the collaborative model implemented over time is most effective. Technology that can be used to facilitate global learning Faculty and students can use a variety of free online tools to develop and implement a virtual exchange such as Zoom, Skype, WhatsApp, Slack, Google or other platforms. Social media platforms are also useful and student-friendly tools to facilitate asynchronous collaboration that happens outside of class time and for individual analysis and reflection. Faculty can choose to be an active participant in a group platform, using it to develop community between partner classes as well as prompt, monitor, and evaluate student engagement, or they can request that students engage one-on-one with counterparts on their own schedules. Whatever the approach, it’s important to use tools that are equally accessible for everyone involved. Recently developed virtual exchange partnerships on campus IU School of Nursing:  A “snowballing” of engagement Over the past two years, the School of Nursing has been steadily growing an effort to use video-conferencing to enhance student knowledge and abilities in examining the social determinants of health in relation to global health issues. What began as a two-way dialogue, has added a third international partner, and is poised to add two more. The initial partnership was a collaborative effort between IUPUI’s Barbara deRose, Clinical Assistant Professor in the IU School of Nursing, and Maria Begoña Errasti-Ibarrondo, a researcher with the nursing summer school program at University of Navarra in Spain. Based on the course “Managing Illness Across Care Environments,” the two faculty partners jointly decided on the topics and questions that formed the foundation of the dialogue. When she was an IU student, deRose participated in a multidisciplinary in-person exchange to Mexico. Learning that Indiana University had established a Global Gateway based in Mexico, she was eager to establish an academic relationship with the nursing school at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). Not knowing exactly who to partner with, deRose worked closely with the IU Global Gateway in Mexico City, which served as a liaison and introduced deRose to potential faculty collaborators. During this single exchange, students discuss the most prominent health concerns facing the citizens of their country, environmental concerns impacting health, and health services available in their countries via video conference. The collaboration is poised to further expand as Ukamaka Oruche, Associate Professor and School of Nursing Director of International Programs, has invited faculty from both Moi University in Kenya and Nnmedi Azikiwe University in Nigeria to observe the international dialogue with the intent of incorporating courses from those institutions in Fall 2020. Herron School of Art+Design:  Support from an institutional partner Early in Spring 2020, a conversation between Bryan Richards, Adjunct Instructor, Herron School of Art + Design, and OIA Director of Curriculum Internationalization Leslie Bozeman led to a virtual exchange collaboration between Richards and IUPUI’s partner institution, Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (Tec de Monterrey) in Mexico. Richards teaches Design Thinking techniques to boost creativity, problem solving, and clarity of communications in the business and social sectors. His Tec de Monterrey partner, Pedro Pacheco-Vázquez, Associate Professor, Department of Architecture, teaches a course that employs similar techniques and has complementary projects to Richards’. Neither Richards nor Pacheco knew each other before working on this virtual exchange. Bozeman sought assistance from Tec de Monterrey’s Global Classroom Coordinators Gabriela Méndez Carrera and Ricardo Lyle Bañuelos to help identify a partner for Bryan. The Tec de Monterrey team facilitated a series of video calls during which Richards and Pacheco found commonalities in their teaching styles and course goals. Neither Richards nor Pacheco knew each other before working on this virtual exchange. Bozeman sought assistance from Tec de Monterrey’s Global Classroom Coordinators Gabriela Méndez Carrera and Ricardo Lyle Bañuelos to help identify a partner for Bryan. The Tec de Monterrey team facilitated a series of video calls during which Richards and Pacheco found commonalities in their teaching styles and course goals. From there, Richards and Pacheco quickly established virtual activities for their students, using ideation and visual design skills to enrich daily life among urban residents. A subset of each class and the faculty met outside of their regularly scheduled time, using their own mobile devices to discuss how they would get to know and work with one another. After mutual sharing of cultural information, IUPUI students provided feedback to Tec de Monterrey students on their projects, as the Tec de Monterrey students were further along in implementation. Richards says, “Ideally, the students from both our cities will get to comment more on each other’s projects, which will lead to more learning for all of us.” Pacheco adds, “This exchange is helping both classes learn new ways to do field research, create prototypes, and build replicable tools to solve problems in the community.” In addition to identifying a partner, the Tec de Monterrey team set up both a website and a collaboration hub through Slack in order to foster dialogue between the classes throughout the duration of their virtual exchange. School of Engineering and Technology:  Working with external organizations Corinne Renguette, Associate Professor, Department of Technology Leadership and Communication was contacted by World Learning to consider a collaborative partnership on a grant from the Stevens Initiative to bring together university students and young professionals via virtual exchange to create solutions to their countries’ greatest challenges using code. World Learning was awarded the grant and IUPUI received a sub-contract from World Learning. IUPUI is responsible for curriculum development, recruiting US participants, and running the course, while World Learning provides an organizing framework for the faculty and student participants. This multi-country virtual exchange, called Next Gen Coders Network (NGCN), is structured as a 10-week hackathon that includes instruction on intercultural communication, cross-cultural collaboration, introduction to coding languages, and facilitated project design. It’s open to all IUPUI students from any major. The project, which was offered as a pilot in Spring 2019, addresses grand challenges in the Middle East and North Africa. Students communicate synchronously and asynchronously to complete a collaborative project. They also complete a pre- and post-course survey about their beliefs, values, and assumptions, and complete reflections during the project to foster their own thinking about these areas. Specifically, IUPUI partners with organizations in Iraq (Speak Now English Center, Volunteer with Us, BiteTech) and the Palestinian Territories (Partners for Sustainable Development, Palestine Polytechnic University, and Save Youth Future Society.) While this virtual exchange is not offered for credit, students gain essential skills in collaboration and work toward high level global learning aimed at a group solution to a challenge. Several faculty members in the School are involved in this project. Renguette, who has implemented NGCN in her Technical Communication course, serves as IUPUI lead principal investigator. She works with Christian Rogers, Assistant Professor, and Birhan Payli, Visiting Professor, who serve as co-principal investigators. Rob Elliott, Senior Lecturer, who has implemented NGCN in his Global Information Technology course, and Luke Jones, Lecturer, serve as consultants. After the pilot, they collaborated on ideas and made improvements for the full launch which tool place in Spring 2020. Recruitment for Fall 2020 is under way and anyone can apply. For faculty and staff interested in integrating international virtual exchange into a course or student development program, the Office of International Affairs will provide information and professional development. Lin Zheng, Clinical Associate Professor, Kelley School of Business, along with Rob Elliot, is establishing a faculty and staff community of practice on virtual exchange. For more on these opportunities, please contact Leslie Bozeman, Director of Curriculum Internationalization, at lbozeman@iupui.edu .

A total of 531 students went on study abroad programs in 2015-16, the latest year for which data is available. That's a 20 percent increase over 2014-15 and a 48 percent increase over 2012-13. This increase meets IUPUI's 2013 Generation Study Abroad goal of raising study abroad participation by 25 percent -- three years ahead of schedule. Study abroad is a key component of the campus's strategic goal to provide students with real-world global learning experiences, said Gil Latz, associate vice chancellor for international affairs. \"Study abroad dramatically changes lives and creates the global leaders we need to solve today's greatest challenges,\" Latz said. \"Study abroad teaches students to think in new ways, increases cultural understanding, and helps develop leadership skills, adaptability and independence.\" Victoria Sefcsik, a senior who is majoring in supply chain management with a concentration in pre-medicine, said the Kelley School of Business London study abroad program she attended last spring was \"absolutely incredible, and is an experience I could not have gotten through the classroom. \"During our trip, we gained knowledge on global financial markets while attending a tour and lecture at Lloyd's of London and learned about the implications of Brexit from two lecturers at Regent's University,\" she said. According to university data, IUPUI students who study abroad are more likely to graduate on time and see higher cumulative GPA and faculty engagement. In addition, study abroad alumni are more likely to have a job within a year of graduating, with starting salaries that are higher than the average college graduate. IUPUI students visited 46 countries in 2015-16, with the top three destinations being the United Kingdom, Spain and Germany. The top three schools, in terms of numbers of students participating in study abroad, were Kelley School of Business, the School of Liberal Arts and the School of Science. By class standing, seniors comprised 39 percent of students studying abroad, followed by juniors at 22 percent; professional students at 16 percent; master's students at 14 percent; sophomores at 8 percent; and doctoral and freshman students, each with 1 percent. To date, unmet financial need remains the top obstacle to students studying abroad. IUPUI has piloted the Planning Scholarship for Study Abroad, which provides $3,333 to use toward study abroad and gives students up to three years to use their award. To qualify, students must meet eligibility criteria, including being a first-generation college student and having at least a 2.0 GPA. Study abroad is also a priority of For All: The Indiana University Bicentennial Campaign , with matching funds set aside by President Michael A. McRobbie for endowed funds for study abroad.

We openly welcome students and scholars from around the world and are proud of the 144 countries represented across the IUPUI community. As Indiana University and the world currently manage the Novel Coronavirus, I would like to use this as an opportunity to double down on our commitment to the values of global engagement and inclusivity we hold dear. We recognize that the Coronavirus is impacting members of our IUPUI community and we fully support all students, faculty, staff, scholars, prospective students, and partners of IUPUI who are feeling the impact of this global situation. We also ask the IUPUI community to be mindful of any discriminatory action or statement that might take place as a result of this situation. IUPUI does not accept discrimination in any form, and you can report an incident of discrimination at the link below. We will not waver in our commitment to engaging the world and providing global learning opportunities for all IUPUI students. Report an Incident of Discrimination With this in mind, we are also disappointed by the new 2020 immigrant visa restrictions recently added to other “travel bans” already in place. The Office of International Affairs will continue to process applications for admission and issue the necessary immigration documents, regardless of citizenship. We will also provide advising to help prospective or current students and scholars from the impacted countries. Any action that impacts, even temporarily, the ability of our students and scholars to freely travel to academic conferences, engage in research outside the United States, or return to their home countries without fear of being denied readmission to the United States has a harmful impact on our ability to fulfill our educational and research mission. At times like this, we need to work together. We respect the power of international dialogue, interaction, and travel to transform lives and reduce barriers among people. We are proud to advance internationalization at IUPUI, an unapologetically global and inclusive campus that is committed to making the world a better place.

A: In 2023, the IUPUI International Festival is happening in-person in the IUPUI Campus Center. While the main events of the International Festival itself happens inside the IUPUI Campus Center, 420 University Blvd, Indianapolis, IN 46202, there will be events across campus and online. The stage and most tables are on the main floor atrium (the open space where all the windows and escalators are) with some events downstairs in the lower level and Theater. There are more events all over campus, so check the International Festival Events page for their specific locations. Q: How do I get there, and where do I park? A: In the heart of IUPUI's campus, the Campus Center is easy to get to via public transportation, and connects to multiple bike and walking paths. Visit the IUPUI sustainable transportation webpage for more details. If you're driving or carpooling, you may park anywhere there is visitor parking on campus, which you can see on the campus map .  We recommend parking in the Vermont Street Parking Garage , which connects to the Campus Center. There is also metered street parking across the street. View parking rates here . Q: Who are the performers? A: Most of the performers you see on stage by the bookstore are IUPUI students, scholars, faculty, and staff, with occasional community cultural groups. Q: Why are there a bunch of flags in the Campus Center? A: Each year during the month of the Festival we display The International Center's UN Flag Collection on the railings of the IUPUI Campus Center. These flags represent all 195 United Nations member and observer states.  IUPUI has students from over 140 different countries, so many of these flags represent populations within our student body. We display all the flags according to U.S. flag code, and only display flags that are recognized by the UN, as well as the state and city flags of Indiana and Indianapolis. This does not mean that IUPUI, The International Center, nor the Office of International Affairs endorses a particular country or groups' policies, but we recognize that flags are important cultural symbols and merit thoughtful consideration. Q: I still have questions.  Who do I ask? A: oiaevent@iupui.edu can answer all your IUPUI International Festival related questions. Thank you for your interest, and we look forward to seeing you at the next IUPUI Annual International Festival!

Procedures for both methods follow. In addition, see Food section below if food will be served. Purchase Order (Preferred Payment Method): This process ensures the purchase and vendor is approved by the University's Purchasing Department. Procedure No later than 10 business days before the event submit a written (or electronic) quotation or estimate from the vendor to OIA's administrative office. OIA's administrative office will process it as a purchase order (an invoice can be submitted instead of a quote/estimate). Do not sign or approve contracts or agreements submitted by the vendor. Only University Purchasing Department staff are authorized to do so. If the vendor requests a signature, submit the document(s) to OIA's administrative office who will forward them to Purchasing for approval. In rare instances Purchasing may ask that a different vendor is used. If that occurs, OIA's administrative office will inform the student contact to discuss alternatives. Reimbursement If payment cannot be processed via purchase order, pay for the service/items and submit receipt(s) for reimbursement to OIA within 30 days of your event . The following documentation is required: An original itemized receipt which shows proof of payment. An itemized receipt must include the merchant or vendor name, date of service, each service received or item purchased, and amount of each service or item.

The use of personal rewards club discount cards/numbers, i.e. store loyalty cards, etc. is not allowed (even if the use of the card results in a reduced price). Food If food is served, you must complete and submit OIA's hospitality form to OIA's administrative office before the event. Organizations now can use outside food vendors, but food purchased for an event must: Follow IU Environmental Health and Safety food policies ; In some cases, organizations may need to register their event with the Marion County Public Health Department as a Temporary Event (must register 30 days prior to event and pay $40); Register their event using thespot.iupui.edu If using IUPUI Food Services , payment will be processed via purchase order.

It was an idea to help IUPUI students from all over the world with their transition to both university and American life. At that time, we had a few volunteers who helped the Office of International Affairs welcome new students. Since its inception, sixteen years ago, IPMP has become so much more. Today, the IPMP is a mentoring-based leadership opportunity and a community open to all IUPUI students. Our Mission: We aim to guide the successful social, cultural, and academic adjustment of IUPUI students from all over the world. IPMP equips international students with the knowledge, support system, and tools to prosper at IUPUI and in the US. The IPMP team accomplishes this mission through pre-arrival assistance, one on one mentoring, social opportunities, and cultural programming for new international students. Who are the IPMP Mentors? IPMP attracts students from diverse backgrounds. Mentors are current students, both American and International students. Many of them have lived/studied abroad and understand the experience of acclimating to a new culture.

I was an Admissions Ambassador where I gave campus tours and lead New Student Orientation. After two years, I transferred to the University of Colorado Denver where I was involved in Student Government and the Peer Mentoring Program. Being a peer mentor ignited my love for working with and supporting students. I have a bachelor's degree in Communication with an emphasis in Strategic Communication. I then earned my master's degree from the University of Denver in Student Affairs and Higher Education with an emphasis in Student Development and Inclusion and Diversity. Once I graduated with my master's I worked at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs as an Academic Advisor for two years, and then the Coordinator of Student Activities for a little over one year. I loved my time attending CU Denver and the uniqueness of its campus as it is a tri-institutional campus in downtown Denver. When I came to IUPUI for this position, it felt like home. I love being on an urban campus with the beauty of the city and endless possibilities. I enjoy cooking with my husband, travelling, playing with my dog, Reggie, relaxing, reading, skiing, and exploring to places with friends. Favorite thing about Indianapolis: The incredible amount of activities and restaurants! There is such a variety of food and I love going to sporting events and museums!

He taught one of my most difficult courses in my sophomore year and I frequently attended his office hours for help. He helped me develop my skills, and his guidance and recommendations helped me become who I am right now as a student at IUPUI. One of the most important things I learned from him was the value of consistency. There were times I felt I would never master the concepts for the course, but he refused to give up on me. I now apply this same level of commitment to my mentees, ensuring they feel supported. And at IPMP, international students need not only academic but also moral support to help them grow roots in foreign soil and glow under the rays of opportunity. Bio: I am a young and ambitious person, who has the ability to learn quickly and adapt to any environment. I came to this country from Uzbekistan as an immigrant student with zero knowledge of other cultures and the language of the country. Over the years that I have spent here, I have learned not only English but also other important global languages that are in business demand nowadays. I can speak fluently in English, Russian, Uzbek, Tajik, and conversational Turkish. Best place to eat in Indy: My favorite places to eat in Indy are Al-Rayan Middle Eastern Restaurant and Wei Ramen Restaurant. My favorite thing about IUPUI: What I like the most about IUPUI is the diversity and inclusiveness (as well as the free stuff that they give).

Thus to thank them, I decided to be a mentor so I could help the new incoming students like the way I was helped. Bio: I come from the capital of India, New Delhi. I grew up and completed my schooling there. I love working with computers and thus I chose to major in Computer Science. I also love cooking and eating different types of food. Some of my favorite dishes include Chhole Bhature, Momos (Indian Dumplings), and Mango Lassi. One thing that really separates me from others from my place is that cricket doesn't interest me (or any other sports for that matter). So if you fall into this unique category, I'd love to chat with you. What is one piece of advice for new Freshmen: GO OUT. Period. It's really important to make connections over here, the more you get to know people the more engaged you'll feel. I know it can be hard when you are new, but there are others like you who are finding it hard too, so go out and talk to people, attend events. At the end of the day, sitting in your dorm room on your computer watching Netflix won't do anything. Best place to eat in Indianapolis: Hyderabad House and Petra Cafe.

Bio: Hi, I am Fernanda, I am a first generation American, both sides of my family are from Mexico. I was born and raised here in Indianapolis. I am currently a junior studying at Herron the School of Art and Design, aspiring to someday become a graphic designer.

I enjoy being involved on campus, last summer I was part of OTEAM as a freshman orientation leader and as a First Year Seminar mentor in the fall.  This is my second year mentoring and I am very excited to be part of IPMP and to help international students feel welcomed in Indy and at IUPUI (: What is one piece of advice you'd like to give to new Freshmen: One piece of advice I would give to new freshmen would be to not be afraid of stepping out of your comfort zone and embrace personal growth, as well as being involved on campus through different organizations.

Apart from this, I love to dance, travel places, and spend time biking near the canal. Why did you become a mentor? IPMP was my home away from home when I first traveled to Indy from Dubai during my freshman year. This is the program through which I met my closest friends and got the chance to interact with other international students. Through IPMP, I got the confidence to get involved on campus and become the best version of myself.Â I wanted to become a mentor so that I can help out students just the way my mentors helped me so that they too can find a home away from home in IUPUI through IPMP. Bio: I was born in Bangalore, Karnataka, India, and shifted to Dubai, UAE when I was 5 years old. Being the only child, I was the center of attention for my family for 17 years till we got our lil doggo named Mars who just eats and sleeps all day (i.e. the ideal life). I found my passion for business through my mom who started her own company a few years ago and to follow her footsteps, I am pursuing my degree in the Kelley School of Business. I have been a part of over 10 student organizations in the past 2 years which has helped me meet new people and gain leadership experiences on campus Favorite spot on campus: The Campus Center What is your favorite thing about IUPUI? I love the opportunities that IUPUI provides to its diverse range of students. It has something to offer for all students no matter what you are interested in and truly makes you feel at home. Advice for first time students: Don't be afraid to try new things out! It may initially seem scary with so many changes taking place at once, take your time with it, and when you feel like you are ready, push yourself to step out of your comfort zone and take advantage of everything that IUPUI has to offer. Do things that make you happy and create a gazillion memories! Events Calendar International Peer Mentoring Program Join as a Mentee!

Why I became a mentor: IPMP was my home away from home when I joined IUPUI back in Fall 2020. This is the program through which I met my closest friends and got the chance to interact with other international students. Through IPMP, I got the confidence to get involved on campus and become the best version of myself.

Staying in India I have studied in the Cambridge board and completed my IGCSEs, AS/A levels after which I am currently studying in the American Education board which allowed me to 'educationally' travel throughout the world! I can never truly trace when I found my passion for neuroscience, however, I would like to credit it to the amazing fictional characters I grew up with like Dr. Derek Shepherd from Grey's Anatomy, Dr. Stephen Strange from Marvel and rather novelly, Dr. Amy Farah Fowler from Big Bang Theory series. Best Place to eat in Indianapolis: B est place to eat in Indy, I would say is Buffalo Wild Wings or Condado Tacos downtown Indy! One piece of advice: Don't be afraid to try new things out! It may initially seem scary with so many changes taking place at once, take your time with it, and when you feel like you are ready, push yourself to step out of your comfort zone and take advantage of everything that IUPUI has to offer.

Why I became a mentor: When I first found out about the IPMP, I was excited to learn that there is a community of individuals dedicated to ensuring that international students have a successful journey not only on campus but in the USA as well. I decided to be a mentor because I understand firsthand how it feels to move to a different country and not know what to expect.

Why I became a mentor: Having begun my journey at IUPUI as a mentee in IPMP, I have personally experienced the profound impact of mentors who provided me with invaluable support and guidance.

Why I became a mentor: I became a mentor because I want to help my peers succeed at IUPUI. As a first-generation American, I have seen how hard adjusting to life in the U.S. has been for my family members and friends. I had never heard of a program like IPMP before I came to IUPUI, but I got involved because I love meeting new people and learning about people's cultures. I couldn't pass up the opportunity to help my peers transition to life in the US like no one helped my parents when they first came here. Bio: I was born in Seattle, WA, but I grew up in Connecticut, Missouri, and Wisconsin. I went to all four years of high school in Milwaukee, WI, which is where my family lives currently, so I am an out-of-state student. My family is from India (Pune and Meerut) and I am a first-generation US citizen. I am majoring in biology (pre-med) and I intend on pursuing a psychology minor eventually. I also have a lot of pets -- two cats, a dog, and a handful of fish. Best place to eat: Bangkok Restaurant & Jazz Bar, The Eagle, or shake shack. My advice: One piece of advice I would give to new freshmen is to be open to meeting new people. Whether you're coming from abroad or you are a domestic student, everyone is new to IUPUI as a freshman and open to making friends, you just have to try to reach out to people. Also, don't be scared to ask for help from professors or your peers if you're having a hard time adjusting during the first year, it's totally normal, and I guarantee people will be more understanding than you think.

Why I became a mentor: I became an IPMP mentor to help other people in the ways other people helped me and the ways I needed help. I think becoming a mentor would be a great opportunity to help other people in the ways that I can and at the same time learn from the program while meeting new people. Bio: I was born in a city called Al-Ain, UAE and I moved to the US when I was 9~10. I moved around a few times before starting my undergrad at IUPUI. I like meeting new people and I'm very curious in learning all the different interests people have. I believe that a lot of personal growth can happen by truly listening to other people and embracing that diversity to learn more about the world and each other. Favorite Spot on Campus: My favorite spot on campus is the Lockfield Gardens in front of North Hall, especially during early Fall semester when the basketball courts are packed with people at night and people are hanging out in the grass or the volleyball courts. They play movies with a big projector at night if the weather is nice. My advice: One piece of advice for a Freshman would be not to get scared of getting very involved on campus ASAP. Go on the spot and join every organization you think you'd have any interest in being a part of (this is actually how I found out about IPMP).

Why I became a mentor: As an international student myself, I can understand and relate to the struggles of moving to a new place and adapting to life here. I want to help other students who might go through a similar feeling. Through IPMP I was able to meet many people and make good friends by attending the different events that took place throughout the year and it helped me adjust to the environment and break out of my shell. IPMP is beneficial in so many ways and helped me get more involved with campus activities and other volunteer work as well.

I am currently on the pre med track and I aspire to be a doctor in the near future. Favorite spot on campus: Campus Center Favorite thing about IUPUI: IUPUI is a very diverse campus that provides ample amounts of opportunities to all students in different fields thus helping them achieve their respective dreams.

Not only will they inevitably have colleagues from international backgrounds, but by nature of their field, they will have international clients and a global audience. In addition to content-specific learning goals, both courses are guided by five outcomes aligned with IUPUI’s International Learning Goals*. One of many group projects requires students to work as a multicultural team to design a website for a specific country and context, forcing them to think about their audience and how they would do things differently to adjust their language and design for that specific culture. Not only does this project encourage students to appreciate the complexity of contemporary cultural systems and know the fundamental principles of intercultural understanding and communication, but working in mixed-culture groups with classmates who think and work differently presents ample opportunities for students to learn humility in the face of difference, tolerance of ambiguity and unfamiliarity, and willingness to be in the position of a learner when encountering others. “ I am grateful for the lessons Ms. Acheson has integrated into our course as I have already applied them to my work, even before exiting the university” Justin Copeland, Student, Advanced Database course. Benefit to the Students Before stepping into the workforce, students are given ample opportunities in class to discover and explore areas of their profession that can be internationalized. These activities prepare them for the intercultural interactions they will have in the workplace and give them tools for conflict resolution. In-class discussions and exercises trigger them to think globally, and students leave Lingma's classes with a raised awareness of themselves, their profession, and how they fit into the greater world of programming and web application design. These in class discussions and exercises teach the students that technology blurs borders especially true for those in the technology field. They realize the importance of understanding another culture and being engaged in international and intercultural events. These practices prepare students to enter the workforce more confidently and perform better from the very start. Benefit to the Faculty Member Lingma has found that teaching is more exciting, fun and overall enjoyable when she takes her teaching materials and integrates them into a global context. Seeing students having deeper conversations and sharing their cultures motivates her. When she facilitates discussions and allows students to talk about the different cultures they know, she is also able to learn more about those cultures. Using surveys at the beginning and end of her course, she checks herself to see if she has successfully raised an awareness of global thinking and encouraged a global mind-set in her students, and the results are consistently positive and encouraging. Five International Learning Goals used in the courses : Have a good working knowledge of the broader world, its natural systems and nations, their characteristics, and their relationships with each other. Appreciate the complexity of contemporary cultural systems and know the fundamental principles of intercultural understanding and communication. Are humble in the face of difference, tolerant of ambiguity and unfamiliarity, and willing to be in the position of a learner when encountering others. Understand the global context of their chosen profession and have blended international perspectives into their professional learning. Have developed a sense of responsibility and involvement with pressing global issues concerning health, poverty, the environment, conflict, inequality, human rights, civil society, and sustainable economic development.

This graduate-level course provides students with an introduction to comparative perspectives on philanthropy ethics, mainly between China and the United States. Benefit to the Students “ “Through my participation in the course, I was consistently challenged to reconcile the ethical perspectives I have known for years with fascinating, ancient Chinese teachings. The regular analysis and recognition of cultural differences and their impact on society not only enhanced my understanding of philanthropic traditions, both in the United States and abroad, but helped me better understand international politics, events, and collaboration. This course offered by the Lilly Family School of Philanthropy sets students on the path to increased cultural competency.” -Erin Crowther, Student  M.A. Philanthropic Studies, 2019 Students in the course at IUPUI and SYSU leave with an increased sense of empathy for others by being able to recognize universal, shared questions about helping one another. What’s more, students are able to articulate value systems in philanthropy more clearly in both conversation, independent writing assignments, and when engaging with others outside the classroom. These outcomes are in line with the IUPUI’s International Learning Goals. Benefit to the Faculty Member Curriculum Internationalization at IUPUI “I think we learn more about ourselves and our own culture when we look at another. We all take culture, habits, expressions, and value systems for granted because that is what we know. Just like traveling to another place, studying an aspect of another country illuminates both that country or region as well as your own. Everyone grows from that experience—faculty as much as students.” - Dr. Kathi Badertscher Although developing a new course proved challenging, Kathi described the process of collaborating with Professor Wang to create Philanthropy Ethics, East & West , as being “rewarding in every way”. Before each class, Kathi would often get to the room a bit early and find classroom full of students already discussing the readings and weekly topics. “It was sort of a ‘buzz’ in the room that made it clear that [the students] cared and were engaged with the course material,” Kathi mentioned.  At the Lilly Family School of Philanthropy we underscore that philanthropy is a universal human concept.  Students reinforced this notion powerfully.  At the end of the semester, every student said they expected to learn about their differences from their peers in China; instead they learned how much we are alike.  This recognition has informed my understanding of teaching the history of philanthropy and other ethics courses in our curriculum.

Design in a multicultural society requires a pluralistic understanding of diverse cultures through lived experiences. This process can be communicated through innovative visions to unify cultural differences that reflect our design curriculum. Virtual exchange represents a perfect method to learn about the values of design within different communities. I developed a two-month-long virtual exchange collaboration as a method to approach decolonization in design and to incorporate concepts of curriculum internationalization. This includes an exchange of ideas while keeping the language of design central alongside a collaborating professor based in South Korea from Yonsei University for Herron’s Typography course. “ “How might we empathize with one another when we do not share a common cultural experience?” Amrita Datta Even when cultures speak the same language, they do not always understand one another. However, Design is the core language shared between students studying in Herron and their South Korean counterparts. Instructors and students have been meeting through multiple Zoom meetings to engage in constructive conversations aimed at developing an intercultural collaborative project. Herron students have been highly encouraged to develop relationships with students through social networking platforms like Mural, WhatsApp & Kakao Talk. Each week, students from each country are given the same prompts to identify design features that are key to designing a cultural artifact. In the typography course, students decide how they transition through the Design Thinking Process as they strive to develop innovative design solutions. They have the ability to work in small groups, with each one consisting of 6 students in total - 3 from each university. The students are tasked with finding their own problem space. This enables students to complete the learning objectives of the course by analyzing cultural and environmental identities within a contemporary design context. This also features interpretations that are related to the exchange of course theories and other understandings of identity to develop their intercultural competence. Developing this cultural artifact by defining their problem space teaches students about the values that can be ascertained through cultural exchanges. This also teaches students about the significance of intercultural tolerance. In addition to recognizing their place within a multicultural society while working through their course objectives, the students are following these IUPUI Dimensions of Global Learning: Analyze their own beliefs, values, assumptions, experiences, and/or communication styles in respect to those of at least one other culture. Practice intercultural communication with the intent of cultivating respectful and productive collaboration, dialogue, and engagement with others. Demonstrate understanding of the workings of other nations, cultures, and/or the geopolitical processes and systems that connect the world. Explain the global, international, and/or cultural dimensions of their disciplines, professions, and/or educational interests. Summarize the consequences of policies, global systems, and/or historical trends for people as well as how people the world over impact these processes. Apply learning from internationalized experiences in the communities and contexts in which they live, work, learn, and/or serve. Benefit to the Students: During the virtual exchange projects, students develop their ability to engage with individuals belonging to different ethnicities, nationalities, religious affiliations, and cultural backgrounds. Cultural exchanges and research design perspectives are pursued through comparative and collaborative tasks based on prompts. This also includes a strong emphasis on synthesizing different forms of data, applying theories, and presenting their progress together each week. This pedagogical structure of online collaboration encourages students to explore principles of autonomy and reciprocity while receiving first-hand experience with investigating models of visual inquiry. Finally, this approach instills a comprehensive understanding of visual culture by exploring its impacts within the design and abroad. “ “Being able to collaborate and learn from our Yonsei peers has greatly enriched how I view communication and design. Having insight into another culture has helped me to approach the design process in a more global sense and has taught me to consider solutions that are inclusive and honor values and social systems that differ from my own.” Lauren Rutter, Sophomore at Herron School of Art & Design Benefit to the Faculty Member: The internationalization of my courses has brought opportunities to work with professors and students based in other parts of the world and understand the pedagogical shift in design practices that converge in cultural nuances. This facilitates a design process that exposes cultural awareness while valuing the creative vision. Employing virtual exchange pedagogy may ultimately lead to presentations and publications that could diversify the American higher education system. Additionally, the Virtual Global Learning Fellow Grant Program at IUPUI allows faculty to cultivate research collaborators. It also provides researchers with cross-cultural connections. It is a worthwhile incentive if you are concerned about the prospect of securing funding opportunities for your intercultural collaboration.

With the world more interconnected than ever before, our students must understand how to integrate international and cultural issues that they’ve never considered. Therefore, I’ve worked to include internationalization throughout our curriculum so that we can build graduates who are better positioned to navigate the world. My courses have always centered on collaboration and active learning.  IT is an inherently collaborative field, so it’s important that students learn to cooperate with one another.  But almost more importantly (to me) is the opportunity for students to exchange and debate ideas with one another.  It’s critical for them to get out of their own heads while solving these problems, so that they can better incorporate the perspectives of others into the solutions they build. This is a big, messy world with a lot of blurry boundaries. I want my students to embrace the messiness and be prepared for it--not be surprised or scared by it\" Benefit to the Students “ “This experience has given me more respect for the issues facing those less fortunate than I. I learned that people everywhere are the same, the openness and kindness of the Indian people revealed to me that being a good person is not found in one’s job title, their money, or what they have, but rather how they interact with others and what they can offer to society as a human being.” Kete Ennis, Student in Global IT Management, 2017 Employers and our industry partners are laser-focused on the concept of “soft skills.” The competency of our graduates –their potential employees – is no longer measured simply by what they “can do,” but rather how applicants are doing the things they can do.  Having a broader outlook of the world provides graduates a significant advantage when marketing themselves. This is in line with IUPUI’s Dimensions of Global Learning. Benefit to the Faculty Member Curriculum Internationalization at IUPUI “We live in a world where physical barriers – oceans, mountains, walls – are less important every day.  Our interconnectedness should be a strength instead of a weakness.  Students must incorporate that into their mindset in order to succeed.” - Rob Elliott \"I’m a native Hoosier who was born 8 miles from IUPUI.  I never traveled outside of the US until after college and as soon as I did I realized how much I had missed.  I want to work very hard to ensure my students are provided more experiences than I had, because I know now that I needed these experiences much earlier.\" Study Abroad Curriculum Internationalization Dimensions of Global Learning Incorporate a Global Perspective Curriculum Internationalization in Action at IUPUI Lingma Lu Acheson Kathi Badertscher Amrita Datta Rob Elliott Estela Ene Gabriel Filippelli Yao-Yi Fu William P.

With regard to curriculum internationalization, we explore connections between language, culture, and worldviews. We consider the U.S. in a global context when we examine world Englishes, social and ethnic dialects, and language and power in society, both in the classroom and through service-learning activities. For the latter, international students experience community engagement in Indianapolis through visits to food banks, refugee camps, and other community organizations. In 2010, I developed an online English Composition course for 2+2-degree programs between IUPUI and international strategic partner universities. In 2017, I began implementing the model of cross- or multicultural composition (in collaboration with Writing Program instructor Mary Ann Cohen). Made up of 2/3 international students and 1/3 domestic students, this combined course entitled ‘Reading, Writing and Inquiry’ focuses on global issues. The students engage in classroom discussions as well as write peer reviews to further their understanding and appreciation of each other’s cultures and viewpoints. “ “We live in a multicultural, globalized world in which we engage across cultures, locally and globally, more than ever. As individuals, societies, and educational systems, we share the responsibility to understand and promote multiculturalism. I place it at the core of my teaching, research, and service.” Dr. Estela Ene Benefit to the Students: As mentioned above, for one of our EAP classes, ‘Academic English Reading: Perspectives on Culture/Society’, which focuses on reading at the high intermediate level, we incorporate a service-learning component into the curriculum. The combination of curricular and co-curricular activities provides impactful opportunities for global learning that have not only provided many students a glimpse into “real” life in the U.S. but for many, it is a transformational experience that goes far beyond learning English. “ “I believe that in and out of the classroom, Professor Ene has demonstrated her commitment to multiculturalism, diversity, international students, and cultural competency. This is seen in her continued efforts with future educators as well as current faculty and staff. I am proud to be a part of her efforts and am grateful for the cultural values she has instilled within me.” Je’Nobia Smith, MA in TESOL graduate, IUPUI Diversity Fellow, member of the CoP on Intercultural Learning Benefit to the Faculty Member: I enjoy facilitating and witnessing the personal growth individuals experience when exposed to globally minded materials and approaches. Internationalizing curriculum is a fun intellectual challenge. With every student and faculty member who becomes more globally-oriented and interculturally competent, campus life – our life – improves. I hope that the presentations and publications I developed based on my work inform and inspire others at IUPUI and other institutions to promote curriculum internationalization and intercultural competence.

IUPUI became one of the Diplomacy Lab university sites in 2015, and I saw this as an opportunity to integrate international experiences into two courses that I typically teach—a graduate course titled Applied Earth Sciences: The Human Dimension and a capstone course for our B.S. Environmental Sciences degree titled Global Cycles. “ “Internationalizing the curriculum through engagement with the Diplomacy Lab provided invaluable opportunities for my students to learn the value of their academic training in a global setting, and for me to continue efforts to improve international diplomacy through university partnerships.” Dr. Gabriel Filippelli We are now involved with our 3 rd and 4 th Diplomacy Lab project this semester. One project is a partnership and mentoring program between our class and a sustainable engineering course underway at the University of Pernambuco in Recife, Brazil, with our involvement being training students and advising them on how to develop and conduct research that has real impact. The other project is on developing tools that the U.S. Embassy in Saudi Arabia can use in its outreach and engagement efforts to highlight the importance of environmental protection in preserving its coastal ecosystems. Benefit to the Students: By working together and engaging with State Department officials, students have gained a much greater understanding of the value of their academic training for addressing global issues. They also have a tangible project report to show for these efforts. “ “The Diplomacy Lab project and presentations opened my eyes up to engaging in an international forum, developing solutions together with my classmates, and utilizing my skills on a real-world problem. It also got me my first job after graduating! The interviewer was blown away that I had worked with the State Department and engaged in an international issue—she said that it really made me stand out from the other applicants, who had the same degree that I did but not the Diplomacy Lab experience.” Christa Phelps, Student in M.S. Geology Program, 2017 Benefit to the Faculty Member: These efforts helped me to focus courses on a tangible problem. Additionally, they helped inform my approach to assisting students on a group project, a sometimes tricky prospect for which I learned the importance of having the group self-assign workloads.

This course provides students at IUPUI and the University of Primorska in Slovenia with an international perspective on the key issues facing global tourism. About 96 IUPUI students and 80 Slovenian students have been impacted by this course. The main goals for the course are to learn about global tourism from different global and cultural perspectives, provide students with an international experience without traveling abroad, and further develop students' intercultural competence. “ I think overall our class has learned a lot about a different culture and through our differences; we have created a bond through learning from each other. I believe we will continue to build upon this bond and will continue our global dialogue long after this course is over. Student The course involves two weekly videoconferences, during which students from both countries discuss topics related to global tourism. Course Networking Global Classmates feature is used by students and faculty to connect outside the classroom. In addition, class activities are designed to provide students with a variety of formal and informal ways to connect and engage in intercultural learning. At the end of the semester, students are asked to reflect on their virtual global experience using a conceptual framework based on knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) that represent intercultural competence (Deardorff, 2008). Benefit to the Students The virtual global experience has been very fruitful for the students who learned about a different culture, its history, expanded their intercultural understanding and learnt to appreciate the differences. These outcomes are in line with the IUPUI’s International Learning Goals.

Helling William P. Helling View more profiles » Lecturer and Associate Program Director Library and Information Science, School of Informatics and Computing Internationalized Course: Information Structures for the Web My course Information Structures for the Web (S531/I400) incorporated a virtual exchange with our partners in Finland. This course combines IUPUI graduate and undergraduate students with counterparts from Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences. IUPUI and Haaga-Helia students collaborate on group website projects during the entire spring semester. IUPUI students gain experience in delivering services to international users with this virtual exchange. We work together in Canvas and Microsoft Teams, asynchronously and synchronously with video and audio chat. By working with students from around the world who attend Haaga-Helia, IUPUI students practice intercultural communication and cross-cultural teamwork. IUPUI students from S531/I400 who wish to study abroad can enroll in S604/S400 and extend their international experiences. These students travel to Helsinki for two weeks in late May to meet their collaborators in person and experience intercultural activities that further extend cultural understanding. By incorporating the IUPUI International Learning Goals, I am able to provide an international perspective to information science and enhance student competitiveness in the global marketplace. “ \"The global pandemic that separated and isolated us in spring 2020 did not dampen our desire for international collaboration. Instead, this event made us realize even more how valuable our global work has become and how creative we must be in the future to maintain and expand our efforts despite any obstacles.\" Dr. Helling Benefit to the Students The students learn to work with international students on an important area of common concern: global information delivery. They acquire the technical skills necessary for the task while enhancing their collaboration skills, their intercultural communication, and learning to work across different time zones and with colleagues with different levels of English to complete group projects that culminate in usable and accessible websites viewable on any device. Students need to work in a setting with international partners. Overcoming language, cultural differences, and even time differences prepare them for future roles in organizations whose reach is expanding. A student's future career may depend on demonstrating the highly desired collaboration skills they acquire in managing global group projects. Benefit to the Faculty Member I was able to bring undergraduate and graduate students together from different programs and skill levels so that they could combine their strengths and work with international students. I have partnered with Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences since 2013 on informal collaborative classes, but I am now able to incorporate my earlier success into an officially sponsored set of courses and study-abroad program. I anticipate further advances in successfully teaching all levels in an international setting. Working with an international partner takes continuous commitment. It is easy to lose focus and contact when personnel and situations change over time. However, with this commitment, the virtual exchange provides benefits for one's academic and personal pursuits. The investment in an international partner will pay off in many ways for both sides. Check out the gateway site to five collaborative website projects created by the IUPUI and Haaga-Helia students. $20,000 Grant for DEI Work Between IUPUI and Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences \"Building Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) in Higher Education for Staff, Students, and Teachers\" In addition to his virtual exchange work, Dr. Helling received a grant of  $20,000 from the U.S. Embassy in Finland through the Small Grants Program . This international collaboration between IUPUI and Haaga-Helia is the start of a longer-term engagement in DEI activities. The connections made during this collaborative process will form the basis of a sustainable partnership that can include all the 3UAS members along with other institutions of higher learning in Finland. This experience will help others interested in establishing DEI working groups or simply collaborating on DEI topics and activities.

In both of my courses, students here at IUPUI converse with students majoring in Education at UAEH about the education systems in Mexico and the U.S. “ “Curriculum internationalization helps promote intercultural understanding that is such a necessary component in the quest for local, national, and global social justice.” Dr. Deborah Biss Keller On the days that we videoconference, I instruct my students to each be prepared with two questions for their UAEH counterparts. Our discussions usually follow the same format: a student from UAEH will ask a question about the U.S. education system, we address it, then one of my students asks a question about the education system in Mexico, and they address it, and so on. During these exchanges, there is usually a translator present at UAEH.  Students there typically speak in Spanish, though sometimes they speak in English. Students in my courses respond and ask questions in English, although I encourage those who are native Spanish speakers to speak in Spanish if they wish. This virtual dialogue provides all of the students an opportunity to gain better intercultural understanding as conversations often move to cultural, political, and economic dimensions – all of which are related to education. “ \"The international videoconference, organized by the School of Education, is an important cross cultural experience for our students. They have the opportunity of discussing with students from IUPUI about the reality of the educational systems, such as the influence of the cultural backgrounds and the perceptions they have as students; specially when they are willing to be teachers. We definitely celebrate that the use of technologies is helpful when we try to exchange these kind of ideas that contributes to their critical thinking and their academic development\" Berenice Alfaro Ponce, Research Professor, UAEH The intercultural component of this course allowed IUPUI students to see their own culture in perspective and to appreciate the diversity of the human experience. The reviews emphasized the need for the students to be open-minded, to reconsider previously-held beliefs and to adjust their thinking based on newly-received information. The students also understood the necessity of being able to operate with respect and dignity in a complex world, and to recognize the connectedness of local and global communities. Benefit to students The experience of videoconferencing with UAEH is particularly important for my students to have myths and stereotypes surrounding Latinx immigrants debunked, and for my students to recognize Latinx students’ funds of knowledge. As prospective teachers, it is crucial for my students to be culturally competent and to examine their assumptions and beliefs about others. The experience also provides the students in Mexico the opportunity to hear that we value their culture. As a follow-up, students engage in class discussion and/or reflective writing assignments. Students’ reflections have emphasized the importance of gaining access to different perspectives on teacher education and education systems; communicating via translators; appreciating other people’s groups and cultures; and more. The aim is for my students to develop self-awareness that facilitates an openness to grapple with many types of systemic oppression and their roles in working toward a more equitable society. Student Reflections \"I never had the opportunity of assisting to a video call with foreign students. So this was a unique, pleasant and interesting experience for me. I had the opportunity to ask some questions such as, the way of assessment in their school and about the process of admission to enter the university. I was able to gather a lot useful and novel information that I did not know very well about their educational system and extra things. I hope to repeat this experience again\" - Zaira Cortéz, UAEH Student “I loved being part of the teleconference. I think it opened our minds about our positionality in the world as students in the USA. I found it very interesting and appreciated the fact that we could get a real-world answer for the questions we had and broadened our horizons with culture, education, and language. I would do it again if given the chance!” - Halsey Foltz, Former Student in Examining Self as Teacher (F200) Course, IUPUI “Videoconferencing with students from Mexico gave me an opportunity to make a global connection. Through this experience, not only did I gain insight into how higher education operates in Mexico, but I also realized the value of technology in education. Building relationships with other students and educators from a different country gave me more depth as a student and more confidence when working with individuals from different ethnic backgrounds.” - Jennifer Hashem, Former Student in American Culture & Education (H341) Course, IUPUI \"It was a wonderful experience. Getting to know about how the educational system works in another country was very interesting. However, the thing, which I most enjoyed, was having the opportunity to share our own experiences and thoughts with other students who are studying education as well. I learnt how different the scholar life is and the pros and cons we have at our own schools.\" - Diana Ramírez, UAEH Student Benefit to faculty The cross-cultural dialogue helps me in teaching intercultural understanding. I have presented about the experience at the national level at the Critical Questions in Education Conference , hosted by the Academy for Educational Studies, and with students at the Edward C. Moore Symposium on Excellence in Teaching .

There’s so much to learn, see and experience. Students and faculty alike have much to gain by adding international perspectives to a course.” Ian McIntosh In the course, 16 students from IUPUI and 16 students from Gaza University were placed into virtual groups to explore solutions to four main points of division between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East: settlements, borders, refugees, and Jerusalem (Al Quds). Both Ian and his co-instructor were present at each session to aid in facilitating thoughtful dialogue within the groups. Distinguished guest lecturers and experts on the Middle East were also invited to the course to provide a well-rounded understanding of the complex history of conflict in the region. Additionally, students in both classrooms were paired with a counterpart to conduct weekly, one-on-one conversations either through email, Skype or Facebook. During these one-on-ones, both sets of students were tasked with interviewing their respective partners to learn more about their hopes and dreams for the future. Although the course dealt with the much larger topics of peace and reconciliation, students from IUPUI were encouraged to familiarize themselves with Palestinian life and culture outside of the classroom through interactions with members of the Palestinian community on campus and in the broader community. Students visited a local mosque where there was a lively discussion on the place of women in Moslem society. They also enjoyed Middle Eastern food on several occasions and learned some basic Arabic language. In order to gain a glimpse into the daily lives of Gazans, IUPUI students were additionally assigned virtual host families from Gaza with whom they exchanged videos and learned from their first-hand accounts the realities of living in a conflict zone. Benefit to students The intercultural component of this course allowed IUPUI students to see their own culture in perspective and to appreciate the diversity of the human experience. The reviews emphasized the need for the students to be open-minded, to reconsider previously-held beliefs and to adjust their thinking based on newly-received information. The students also understood the necessity of being able to operate with respect and dignity in a complex world, and to recognize the connectedness of local and global communities. Benefit to faculty To host a successful program, the onus is on the project leaders to create a learning environment where there is a willingness by students to step outside of their comfort zones and to interact with and learn from people from quite different cultures and ways of life. There were many challenges, and also many lessons and rewards. The most noteworthy was a chance to see a vision of the future emerge from the Peace Incubator that was quite different to that constrained and defined by the politics of walls, rockets, drones, tunnels and warships, and the futility of endless retaliation and revenge. Ian and Jamil are hopeful that this classroom intervention was significant in the longer-term search for peace and prosperity in the Middle East.

While students do not necessarily need to leave their city or classroom for such engagement, virtual exchange offers them an opportunity to put into action within a different context the various concepts and methods they are learning. As a form of curriculum internationalization, I developed 3 and 4 week-long virtual exchange projects in collaboration with university professors in the United Kingdom for my Ethnic Identity and Anthropology of Tourism courses. For each class, students from both countries met jointly in live Zoom meetings to discuss a series of questions and continued the conversations via postings on the social networking platform, CourseNetworking. Each week’s discussions built on one another and helped students identify key differences and similarities across both nation-states related to specific topics, such as tourism development and identity construction and politics.  For example, in the Ethnic Identity course, the virtual exchange and accompanying fieldwork and analysis assignments enabled students to more deeply carry out the course learning objectives of analyzing ethnic and national identity construction by co-developing with their UK partners knowledge about contemporary issues unfolding in each country that, when combined with library research and the application of course theories, led to a greater understanding of national identity negotiation and politics. As students reach the course learning objectives with the help of the virtual exchange, they also meet several of IUPUI’s Dimensions of Global Learning , including engaging in productive and respectful intercultural communication, illustrating an understanding of another country’s cultural and geopolitical processes, and practicing reflection as it relates to their own beliefs and assumptions.\" Benefit to the Students “ “Having the opportunity to talk with individuals from places other than our own helped me understand, respect, and relate to others by learning and connecting with the backgrounds and lives of the people I engaged with, even if we share the same language. Especially during times of great change and adaptivity, the need for a global connection was wonderful and wanted.” Cory, Undergraduate Student During the virtual exchange projects, students develop skills in leading discussions in intercultural contexts, which involves interviewing and active-listening, synthesizing different forms of data, and applying theory to analyze their data. Such communication and analysis skills are invaluable to students’ future success across disciplines, and the first-hand experiences in digital ethnography are especially important for many of our majors. Benefit to the Faculty Member Curriculum Internationalization at IUPUI “Virtual exchanges and the resulting internationalization of the curriculum facilitate productive crossing of borders at many different levels, from disciplinary to cultural to pedagogical. Such crossing of borders helps foster holistic and intercultural perspectives that are key for finding solutions to global challenges.” - Dr. Audrey Ricke \"Through the internationalization of my courses, I have been able to develop working relationships with scholars in the United Kingdom. These working relationships in turn have fostered pedagogical creativity in course activities and design.\" Study Abroad Curriculum Internationalization Dimensions of Global Learning Incorporate a Global Perspective Curriculum Internationalization in Action at IUPUI Lingma Lu Acheson Kathi Badertscher Amrita Datta Rob Elliott Estela Ene Gabriel Filippelli Yao-Yi Fu William P.

However, why, when, where, with whom, and many more aspects of eating are heavily influenced by our geographical location, culture, and even governmental policies that dictate our eating guidelines. The Nutrition for Health course (N220) is a general education course whose overarching goal is to teach students the basic principles of nutrition. Through collaborations with three different universities, the students met synchronously four times during a seven-week project with an international partner to analyze what influences what we eat, how this differs between our two countries, and how this all ultimately creates the food habits we utilize in a day-to-day basis. We heavily incorporated the Society and Culture Principle of Learning through the students’ requirement to compare and contrast their eating habits, governmental eating guidelines, and even ways of life while also analyzing and understanding how there are connections that ultimately unite us. This is specifically measured in their final project, a PowerPoint presentation that requires them to share similarities and differences in the two countries’ eating habits and influences, common misconceptions they had about each other’s country’s way of eating, and what the project taught them overall, aside from just eating habits. “ \"Food, by nature, connects us all. Whether we never leave the country or travel all the time, we are eating food from all over the world and have eating habits influenced by our cultures and where we live. This virtual exchange enabled our students to wholly understand this, learning where our differences lie, but also how our similarities converge and connect us. By globalizing my curriculum, my students now have a way to showcase this knowledge.\" Lamia Nuseibeh Scherzinger Benefit to the Students: These projects have been extremely beneficial to our students, especially since we teamed up with the first-year seminar sections in our department to provide our students with a global learning opportunity in their first semester at college. While we know that studying abroad can be an eye-opening and enriching experience for our students, we also know that, due to finances, time constraints, and other limiting resources, many students may never study abroad. The ability to participate in the virtual exchange, therefore, increases their cultural understanding, global citizenship, and digital literacies, all done at no extra cost to my students! We are an interconnected world, and more and more businesses want employees who have experience dealing with other cultures and countries. Global citizenship is required for many jobs, as is the ability to utilize a wide variety of digital tools, which this experience provides. Personally, this project allows our students the chance to experience a culture they probably would have never done so otherwise and opens their worlds a bit more than before the virtual exchange. “ “I just wanted to say thank you for giving us this assignment. I loved getting to know my partners; you couldn’t have paired me up with anyone better! I also loved learning more about the Netherlands.” Heidi Wold, N220 student Benefit to the Faculty Member: Selfishly, part of the reason I started this project was that I value the outcomes of global learning. Limited a bit due to my asynchronous online class format, a virtual exchange was a perfect fit for me. Since then, I have grown the project to occur in both fall and spring annually with two different university partners, presented on this topic at numerous universities, and even recently was awarded the Sarah Baker High Impact Practice Teaching Award! I am deeply passionate about what benefits this project provides my students and am excited to watch it continue to improve each semester. Follow the N220 Virtual Exchange Blog to learn more!

Although this was our initial reason, once we were involved, we became excited about the opportunities for students, especially in terms of introducing them to students from another country. We also felt this focus on globalization was instrumental in teaching our students about cultural competency in healthcare, which is a key component in many of our courses. When we elected to participate in the global initiative, we decided to introduce activities using the UN Sustainable Development Goals and IUPUI’s Dimensions of Global Learning modules into the first year seminar courses. We also contacted the IU Europe Gateway and asked about setting up a virtual meeting with our first-year students and students in another country. Our thought was to allow students to meet and discuss similarities/differences in their first year of college. This led to discussions, and in November 2022, we conducted two virtual exchange sessions with 15 German students from the Technical University of Applied Sciences Wurzburg-Schweinfurt. Each session lasted 90 minutes with a total of 38 first-year students from IUPUI. These sessions were hugely successful. We asked students to reflect on the experience and received only positive feedback. Almost every student mentioned that this experience made them want to study abroad. In addition, every student stated they would engage in such an experience again (38 of our 62 students participated). “ To instructors unsure about incorporating global dimensions or engaging in a virtual exchange, I say go for it. While it can be intimidating to get started, the Office of International Affairs has numerous resources and support to help. The people we worked with at IUPUI were phenomenal and the support was very strong. And, once we started engaging with our international liaison, it was fun to interact with someone from another country and get to meet a variety of people from different areas of the world. It is definitely worth the time and students love the opportunity! Professor Kathy Berlin Nutrition for Health Nutrition is an international activity- we all must eat to survive.

I loved every second of it. I feel like this opportunity is rare, so I had to do it. During this virtual exchange, I got to talk to students from different parts of Germany in breakout sessions. We shared our experiences with the educational system, food, and much more. I learned that I didn’t know much about Germany! anonymous student Benefit to the Student First Year Seminar Reflections from students in the first year seminar courses indicated they benefitted from the global focus in many ways. It allowed them to reflect on their assumptions about individuals from other countries and realize that assumptions are not always based on truth. Students remarked they understood the idea of culture better and how this understanding led to embracing other cultures and beliefs. They also mentioned that the virtual exchange allowed them to “see” how others live compared to them. They stated that values differed, which was enlightening to these first-year students. Finally, students repeatedly mentioned that understanding cultural beliefs would make them better healthcare professionals. From our perspective, what made this virtual exchange successful was the student reaction to the opportunity. The feedback they provided us, both in person and via their reflections, was overwhelmingly positive and demonstrated the need to continue this type of work. In addition, students continued to talk about the exchange when we discussed topics in class, and they brought up other countries or cultures. They would say things like, “Well, at one time I would have agreed but now that I’ve talked with the German students, I think we should look at another viewpoint on this...\" Those sporadic comments showed us that students continued to think “globally” and were more open to considering diverse opinions on a topic. “ I just wanted to say thank you for giving us this assignment. I loved getting to know my partners; you couldn’t have paired me up with anyone better! I also loved learning more about the Netherlands.

The opportunity to allow students to engage with students from other countries was enlightening. To see how students prepared and the excitement they felt interacting with others was phenomenal. A key aspect is that it helped us to understand how the global integration process worked and how best to align this with our courses. Drs. Berlin and Hollender spoke about their virtual exchange at the 2023 E.C Moore Symposium on Excellence in Teaching. Their presentation was titled \"Let's get students talking to other students around the world.\" The PowerPoint is available upon request if you email lbozeman@iupui.edu.

In an effort to provide meaningful global experiences to students who may not have the opportunity to travel abroad, the course Nursing Intensive: Managing Health & Illness Across Care Environments offers a clinical component that is locally based and provides immersion experiences with immigrant/refugee populations. Students enrolled in this clinical component share what they have learned with members of the entire didactic group through a formal presentation. “ Witnessing student growth is the most satisfying aspect of this experience. Many of our nursing students come from rural communities and have not had first-hand experience interacting with persons form other cultures. With the help of technology, they can be transported to another country and hear how their counterparts deal with healthcare issues. It has never been more important than now, during the coronavirus pandemic, to share information globally in order to protect and preserve humanity. This type of experience will help prepare our students to cope with global health issues in the future. Professor Barbara deRose In addition to the clinical experience, all students enrolled in this didactic course meet in a virtual conference with nursing schools from Spain and Mexico. The conference is recorded to maximize the number of students who can benefit from the project. Each semester, approximately 150 IUSON nursing students have access to the recording. During the virtual conference, each school presents the answers to three health related questions from their country’s perspective. In this way, students are exposed to similarities and differences in healthcare between the countries. The participating schools are encouraged to have a post conference reflection session to discuss what has been learned from the experience. Benefit to the Student In the clinical component, students are directly immersed into the immigrant/refugee world to witness barriers in accessing healthcare. In the virtual component, students see health care through a global lens using technology to hear directly from their foreign peers. “ Gaining insight into other countries' health related issues and how their health system works. anonymous student Benefit to the School The greatest benefit of a virtual exchange is that it is an effective way to expose students to thinking through a global lens. It can lead to future projects between partner universities, and it models possibilities for other instructors in the School of Nursing or other schools at IUPUI.

Fairbanks School of Public Health Internationalized Courses: Biosocial Approach to Global Health, Dept of Social and Behavioral Sciences Curriculum Internationalization Effort In my course, Biosocial Approach to Global Health, IU senior undergraduate students in Community Health and MPH students in the Social and Behavioral Sciences work in partnership with MPH students at Hassan 1st University in Settat, Morocco. Students work in teams to compare the status of a particular women’s empowerment issue in both the US and Morocco and then design an intervention strategy to address this issue in both the US and Morocco as a means of improving maternal and child health outcomes in both nations. Students learn to navigate setting up and conducting meetings across two different time zones and vastly different cultural and language norms. In many cases this is the first time for many IU students to work with students within an Islamic nation. Likewise, it is the first time that Morocco students get to meet and work with American peers. I have loved to see new friendships formed, stereotypes eliminated and a deeper understanding of cultures. It is wonderful to see students gain an appreciation for the realities of women’s experiences in both countries and to see students advance a passion for improving women’s empowerment and health outcomes. “ “I really enjoyed working with the Moroccan students throughout this course, I mean how many college students can say they collaborated on a group project with people halfway across the world– not many, so that's why I'm glad I got to have this experience, which I think will help immensely in the real world of public health. Also, it helps so much to get a different perspective of public health in a different country, and it was an eye opening experience that I am so grateful I got to have.” IUPUI Undergraduate Student Benefit to the Students: Students learn how to work with a team of students from a different nation to create a report and intervention plan based on the daily realities, assets and needs of a partner nation, not on US goals/culture. Benefit to the Faculty Member: Teaching in this framework is the greatest joy of my entire teaching career of more than 25 years. The students from both nations provide so much insight into the social determinants of women’s health outcomes.

How does it work? The State Department identifies foreign policy projects in which faculty and their classes can be involved.  Faculty from around the nation bid on the projects. If the bid is accepted, over the course of a semester, professors guide their students in developing a final work product that accomplishes goals outlined by the State Department. Students have opportunities throughout the semester to discuss their research with State Department officials. What is a bid? A bid is a 200 word proposal of why your department is suitable to address the challenge outlined in the project and how the faculty members and students will approach the project. A faculty member submits the bid to IUPUI’s institutional coordinator, Leslie Bozeman, who then compiles all the bids for submission. Example bid: \"Entering our fourth year with the Diplomacy Laboratory Program, from the School of Public and Environmental Affairs of Indiana University, IUPUI Campus, we would be honored to author “Effective Anti-corruption Reforms” for the Office of Political and Economic Affairs of the U.S. Mission to Guatemala. This will be utilizing my graduate class of twenty-eight students from “J531 United States National Security and Homeland Security” this fall. It is our opinion this subject is very important to U. S. National Security and to the vital interests of the United States. Additionally we also desire to improve Guatemalan security and stability and thus the quality of life in Central America’s Violent Northern Triangle. Our Department is Criminal Justice, my field is National Security and we have a number of graduate students from Public Affairs as well. By capitalizing on their academic, law enforcement and government experience, these graduate students will provide concrete recommendations for systemic reforms to strengthen Guatemalan public institutions. Identifying and using successful examples of anti-corruption and institution strengthening reforms from other countries, focused on improving current Guatemalan institutions is the model. The format will be a thirty-page paper.\" Projects Semester projects change with each bid cycle to address the most current global issues.

Global learning is how learners at IUPUI attain the knowledge, skills, and dispositions they need to negotiate and contribute to the complex and interconnected world in which they learn, work, and live.* It includes integrating multiple perspectives into collective learning and problem solving, transcending boundaries, and acting in local and global contexts with a sense of responsibility, humility, and empathy. A life-long process, global learning promotes engagement with people, places, and ideas outside of one’s own environment, and offers practical and intellectual benefits, among them, career readiness, communication skills, and both critical and creative thinking. At IUPUI, global learning is facilitated through the intentional inclusion of people from around the world and results in a global mindset for the entire IUPUI community. Students, faculty, staff, alumni, the broader Indianapolis community, and domestic and international campus partners are essential to collective global learning. Pursuing global learning is a principal goal for OIA’s efforts in curriculum internationalization, study abroad, international partnerships, and international student programs. The Office of International Affairs connects IUPUI faculty and staff with resources that enable them to add a global perspective to their teaching. And our global partnerships expand IUPUI’s capacity to educate students, conduct research, and serve communities. *The Office of International Affairs views this definition of global learning as a \"living definition\" that might evolve over time.

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are the cornerstone of IUPUIs campus internationalization efforts. Our goal is to create interdisciplinary and solution-oriented opportunities for developing curriculum, partnerships, and research focused on the 2030 agenda for global change . The SDGs are a universal call-to-action to end poverty, protect the planet, and improve the lives and prospects of humankind, and it is only by working cooperatively that we can make any headway. Already IUPUI has Gold Star status as a sustainable campus, and we have a considerable number of research projects that are geared to specific SDGs: the AMPATH medical program in Kenya, our Lugar Center for Renewable Energy , the IAHI Environmental Justice seminar series , and more. By working in close cooperation with our international partners, the potential impact of our current efforts will be increased immeasurably. Times Higher Education Impact Ranking The 2022 THE Impact Ranking marks IUPUI's second year of participation in the rankings, reporting on nine SDGs: 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 13, 16, and 17. The Impact Ranking measures universities' progress in addressing the 17 SDGs. The Office of Sustainability submitted the report in October 2021, and on April 27, 2022, the rankings were released.

Here's our basic plan for how to continue engaging IUPUI in the SDGs. Create Create an IUPUI SDG network and advisory board from across disciplines. This network is growing, and you can join by signing up for the mailing list . The SDG Advisory board made up of senior leadership, campus sustainability champions, and students. Translate Translate the work of researchers into the language of sustainable development. The reality is that people are working on the SDGs across IUPUI, and have been for years. Part of our work at OIA is identifying who is actively engaging in SDG work without knowing it and incorporating their research into the SDG framework. Until all of IUPUI defaults to defining their research by the SDGs this work will be ongoing. As a part of the plan to educate faculty and staff on the SDGs, OIA presented an overview of the SDGs in the context of higher education. The presentation is available upon request at imcintos@iu.edu. Survey Survey IUPUI Faculty and Staff on SDG projects and interests, including all courses and study abroad . In order to develop a framework for the SDG-relevant activities and interests across campus, in Summer 2020 OIA conducted a campus-wide survey. The results were illuminating. While only a small percentage of respondents had a working knowledge of the SDGs, a solid majority—over 50%—were working in areas specifically linked to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. Translating the work of IUPUI researchers into the language of the SDGs is a major priority. The survey was conducted from July-September, 2020, with 95 respondents. Survey Results 50% of respondents were Not at all familiar; 28% \"moderately familiar\" and only 22% were \"very familiar\" with the SDGs Perhaps the most interesting result was the answer to the first question: How familiar are you with the UN 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals? Half of respondents answered \"not at all familiar,\" 28% \"moderately familiar,\" with only 22% saying they were very familiar. Despite this, 53.9% had engaged with the SDGs as a part of their course content in the past year. The top 5 SDGs that survey respondents engage in are: Respondents thought that areas where SDGs are most valuable in: 25% Teaching & Curriculum 17.1%Research 17.1% Community Engagement 13.4%Service Learning 10.6% Partnerships 8.9%Co-Curriculum & Programming 7.7%Grants Based on these results, we were able to plan and educate the IUPUI community. Foster Foster new research and projects in sustainability In addition to identifying existing SDG partnerships, OIA plans on leveraging our partnership networks in alignment with SDG 17 to increase partnerships for the goals, between and within nations. A part of fostering new research projects included the 2021 IUPUI Global Research Incubator Grants . The goal of this grant competition is to provide a limited number of high-potential awards that propose interdisciplinary mechanisms to tackle issues that align with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The IUPUI Office of International Affairs and the IUPUI Office of the Vice Chancellor of Research created a new grant mechanism in 2020 to support interdisciplinary research agendas that contribute to advancing the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This program is open to full-time tenure-track/tenured faculty from all IUPUI schools and departments. Grant proposals must address two or more of the Sustainable Development Goals and ideally involve two or more IUPUI faculty from different departments or schools. To align with IUPUI’s dedication to community engagement, research that involves collaborations with local or international communities and partners are encouraged. Additional priority will be given to research proposals that address the SDGs through lenses of social justice and intercultural competence. The IUPUI Global Research Incubator Grants will position IUPUI faculty to contribute to profound global challenges of the 21st century and ultimately make them more competitive for external funding of their proposed research. Recipients will thus be expected to write an external grant proposal of significance within 1-2 years Highlight Highlight best practices through regular international forums In addition to highlighting exemplary projects that already exist, we are also committed to creating new opportunities to expand expertise, like the ongoing SDG Global Conversations . Initiate Initiate an awareness campaign for students on the importance of SDGs as the cornerstone for global learning Even the hyperlocal is globally connected, and a part of expanding SDGs involves including our most important constituents: students. Their passion, interest, and energy for change can be channeled through the SDGs into action that moves us all closer to the better future the UN 2030 Agenda imagines.

Check back soon for more SDGs in action in the Kelley School of Business at IUPUI. Through the Business Sustainability Lab, Dr. Awaysheh works with companies to help enhance their sustainability and financial performance. This work has identified the substantial financial benefit that firms can reap by focusing largely on reducing resource consumption, such as energy and water, and eliminating waste generation within their operations. Founded in 2021, the IU Business Sustainability Lab offers years of research and on-the-ground business experience to firms seeking sustainability strategies. By turning these practices into specific, operational improvements, the lab allows companies to examine, understand, and leverage these strategies to their competitive advantage. Read more on the Business Sustainability Lab The 17 SDGs present the most urgent calls to action are for achieving a more just and sustainable future, while providing Dr. Awaysheh, his business-leading partners, students, and all of us with a universal and visionary framework for accomplishing these goals. Many of the targets within these goals encourage sustainable practices, many of which have been adopted by global companies, and the Business Sustainability Lab is working to further the embrace of these ideals and behaviors. The UN SDGs directly related to the sustainable practices encouraged by the Business Sustainability Lab include SDG 6 (Clean Water & Sanitation), SDG 7 (Affordable & Clean Energy), SDG 8 (Economic Growth & Good Jobs), SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, & Infrastructure), SDG 10 (Reduce Inequalities), and SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption & Production). In addition to strides made in achieving these goals, the Lab and Dr. Awaysheh’s work visibly embraces SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals), demonstrated in the many business, nonprofit, and community partnerships shared within the Lab and Dr. Awaysheh’s endeavors. Read more about how the Business Sustainability Lab is working to achieve these and other SDGs here . Since 2008, sustainability projects led by Dr. Awaysheh have had a measurable impact on the natural environment. Through partnerships and consultation, the Business Sustainability Lab is proving the value add of sustainability.

SDG (Sustainable Development Goal) Mapping: The IU Leadership of the AMPATH Consortium, IU School of Medicine Download & Read the full report Brief Overview Context The relationship between Indiana University (IU) School of Medicine, Moi University School of Medicine, and Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital began 1989 when four IU School of Medicine physicians formed a partnership with the new medical school in Eldoret, Kenya. This three-decade partnership, now known as AMPATH (Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare), includes a consortium of more than a dozen other academic health centers throughout the world led by Indiana University. See ampathkenya.org Collectively, these partners have established one of the world’s largest and most successful HIV care and control programs that has lessened the barriers to accessing antiretroviral therapy and improved the outcomes for people living with HIV, as well as continues to make significant progress toward meeting the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal Agenda 2030. See sdgs.un.org/goals Today, AMPATH serves a population of over 8 million in its western Kenya catchment area and there are currently 170,000 people living with HIV enrolled in care in over 800 care sites.  Working with the Kenya Ministry of Health, the AMPATH partnership is focused on building a health system in the public sector that leads with care in responding to the needs of the population, including people with diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis as well as non-communicable diseases such as cancer, hypertension, and diabetes. This commitment to care provides the foundation for research to improve lives around the world and bidirectional educational opportunities to train future global health leaders from all member institutions of the partnership. AMPATH Partnership and the SDGs The AMPATH partnership is responsible for a restoration of both health and wealth for many Kenyans living with HIV and other serious illnesses through medical research, improved healthcare, and patient support. Over the past decade, many IUPUI schools have joined the Moi University partnership and developed initiatives supporting AMPATH efforts, such as: The Social Science Research Network integrating the areas of sociology, anthropology, political science, traditional medicine, and geography with health; the Legal Aid Centre of Eldoret (LACE) addressing human rights issues faced by Kenyans with HIV; and an engaged bioethics training partnership between Moi University and Indiana University. Collectively, these transformative partnerships are targeting 11 SDGs, most notably SDG 3 Good Health and Well-Being. AMPATH is specifically targeting: SDG 1 – No Poverty 1.4 AMPATH’s microfinance loan program for informal sector workers SDG 2 – Zero Hunger 2.3-2.5 AMPATH and Corteva farmer outreach and knowledge-sharing program 2.3 Micofinance groups with financial and insurance component SDG 3 – Good Health and Well-Being 3.3 Care and treatment for people living with HIV 3.1 The Chamas program for maternal-child health 3.1 & 3.2 The WeCare community health program to decrease infant mortality 3.4 Non-communicable disease and mental health treatment 3.8 Revolving fund pharmacies 3.1-3.8 The AMPATH Research Network 3.C Medical training opportunities 3.2 Specialized care for infants and children 3.7 Reproductive health care 3.8 Creating a sustainable care system in the public sector inclusive of universal health coverage 3.3 & 3.9 Clean air and safe water efforts SDG 4 – Education 4.1-4.7 Medical student, post-graduate, and specialty training in partnership with Moi University and Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital 4.4 Tumaini Innovation Center of alternative education for current and former Eldoret street youth SDG 5 – Gender Equality 5.5 Young female faculty programs with Moi University 5.2 The sexual and gender-based violence care clinic at Moi Hospital 5.6 Focus on gender equity in reproductive health programs 5.3 The Rafiki Centre for adolescent health and vulnerable street youth 5.1 Legal Aid Centre-Eldoret SDG 6 – Clean Water and Sanitation 6.1 The Maji Safi Initiative for clean water at the household, school, and community-levels 6.2 & 6.B AMPATH handwashing stations for community group meetings SDG 8 – Decent Work and Economic Growth 8.3 Development of workforce, organizational and physical infrastructure 8.5 & 8.6 The Creation Hive that inspires, prepares, and employs individuals and families affected by life-altering disease 8.6 Collaborative research publications SDG 10 – Reduce Inequalities 10.6 Supporting and working towards healthcare for all 10.2 Bidirectional training opportunities 10.2 Creation of shared research infrastructure and operation 10.2 Reciprocal innovation incubators among IU and Kenyan colleagues SDG 16 – Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions 16.9 Partnerships with county governments in order to expand national healthcare insurance coverage throughout underserved communities 16.9 Partnership efforts to help Kenyan citizens obtain needed legal documents for health care insurance SDG 17 – Partnerships for the Goals 17.6 Leading collaborative institutional and individual efforts to promote health and wellness throughout western Kenya 17.6 Creating a sustainable model of partnership in medicine and care 17.6 & 17.9 Establishing the AMPATH Consortium that includes universities from around the world 17.9 Fostering reciprocal innovation efforts.

Since 2007, more than half the world’s population has been living in cities, and that figure is expected to rise to 60 percent by 2030. Cities and metropolitan areas are powerhouses of economic growth, contributing about 60 percent of global GDP. However, they also account for about 70 percent of global carbon emissions and over 60 percent of resource use. Rapid urbanization is resulting in a growing number of slum dwellers, inadequate and overburdened infrastructure and transportation services, worsening air pollution and unplanned urban sprawl. How will Electrified and Autonomous Vehicles (EAV) change the nature of our cities? What contribution can they make to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); designed to be a \"blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all\". Electrified and Autonomous Vehicle (EAV) transportation systems and technologies have the potential to disrupt the status quo, alter how people live and work, rearrange value pools, and lead to entirely new products and services. This requires decisions on how to invest in new forms of education and infrastructure, by discerning how disruptive economic change will affect comparative advantages. According to director Yaobin Chen, the mission of IUPUI’s Transportation and Autonomous Systems Institute (TASI) , and its cluster of research centers, faculty, and staff, is to conduct world-class research in connected and autonomous vehicles and intelligent transportation systems through collaboration and partnership with academics, industry, government, and other organizations. EAV systems and digital tools will enable Demand Responsive Transportation (DRT) that is agile—fast, flexible, responsive, and resilient—which will increase car-sharing, reduce traffic congestion and air pollution. EAV and advanced driver assistance systems have the potential to reduce motor vehicle deaths by an estimated 90 percent, saving thousands of lives and roughly $190 billion every year in health care costs. (For example, an autonomous vehicle can easily find a parking spot on its own, they will make public transport easier and more convenient. Extra space will be available on our streets for bike lanes and wider sidewalks, making walking and biking safer and more appealing.) UN Sustainable Development Goal #11 specifically states that, by 2030, we will be able to provide access to safe, affordable, accessible, and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport, with special attention to the needs of those in vulnerable situations, including women, children, persons with disabilities and older persons. Clayton Nicholas, IUPUI’s Industry Research Development Specialist, says that one example of TASI’s engagement to further SDG #11 is the support of the coalition of Toyota’s Mobility Foundation, the Indiana Economic Development Corporation, and the Energy Systems Network, in their Together in Motion initiative. The Together in Motion in Indiana initiative supports the concept of “Mobility for All”, demonstrating the commitment to the goal of sustainable cities. Together in Motion in Indiana is designed to improve the overall movement of people and goods in the changing mobility ecosystem of central Indiana, as underscored in their motto: “Pioneering innovative mobility technologies in the U.S. heartland. There are currently three deployments; an autonomous vehicle shuttle to facilitate the movement of people from the Rapid Transit Station to the western part Indianapolis; an autonomous vehicle shuttle in downtown Fishers, IN; and a contactless goods delivery service for the Indianapolis near Eastside. Research on EAV technology is a critical part of the vision for the transition to safe transportation. TASI’s research also envisions “Mobility for All” which will have considerable societal benefits. Therefore, TASI is not solely focused on EAV technology alone, but also how autonomous vehicles will be deployed equitably (i.e., the elderly, disabled, rural and urban individuals etc.) Traditionally it is after a new technology or service is deployed that discussions begin on the safety, security, ethics, and policies needs that govern optimal implementation. That is not the case in this IUPUI initiative. EAV technologies have the potential to disrupt the status quo, alter how people live and work, rearrange value pools, and lead to entirely new products and services. This requires decisions on how to invest in new forms of education and infrastructure, by discerning how disruptive economic change will affect comparative advantages. Mobility is as important to the poor as it is to the affluent, to the elderly as it is to the young or whether you reside in a city or rural area. EAV technologies have the potential to disrupt the status quo, alter how people live and work, rearrange value pools, and lead to entirely new products and services. This requires decisions on how to invest in new forms of education and infrastructure, by discerning how disruptive economic change will affect comparative advantages. Below are the other SDG’s that align with TASI’s research cluster’s vision and mission: SDG 1 No Poverty: Better access to transportation will increase the range of job opportunities. SDG 2 Zero Hunger: Autonomous vehicles could fill voids in food deserts. SDG 3 Good Health and Well-being: Transportation and mobility for disabled and elderly individuals is known to improve their health and reduce burden on caregivers along with drastically reducing the number of vehicle fatalities that occur annually which is 34,000 in the US alone. SDG 5 Gender Equality: Providing opportunities in emerging STEM fields through EAV systems. SDG 7 Affordable and Clean Energy: EAV systems will reduce dependence on fossil fuels and improve energy efficiency. SDG 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth: Job creation will be driven by an entirely new eco-system of EAV-related business opportunities, while better access to transportation will increase the range of job opportunities. SDG 9 Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure: EAV’s will create a new level of agile logistics and new infrastructure needs – smart cities, roads, urban and rural. SDG 10 Reducing Inequality: Mobility can be the great equalizer, allowing individuals to take advantage of opportunities outside a narrow sphere. SDG 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities: Quality transportation and mobility is essential to sustain vibrant cities and communities. SDG 12 Responsible Consumption and Production: An EAV system uses less components, are more reliable, and creates less waste. SDG 13 Climate Action: EAV systems will reduce dependence on fossil fuels and improve energy efficiency.

A strong advocate of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Dr. Awaysheh studies and teaches on the principles and practices of sustainability in business operations. His academic work in the discipline of business focuses on how firms leverage and understand their data, enhancing their operations and supply chains to improve their financial performance. Combining his knowledge of business operations and his drive for environmental preservation and a sustainable future, Dr. Awaysheh also looks at how firms integrate and manage socially responsible practices in their operations and supply chains to enhance profitability and improve firm valuations. Situated between the three core dimensions sustainable development – the economic, social, and environmental – much of Dr. Awaysheh’s research looks at what companies can do beyond basic philanthropy to help improve their impact on the environment and society, while continuing to make a profit. Through his efforts, Dr. Awaysheh is demonstrating to students and partnering business that organizations can harness the 17 SDGs to drive economic and job growth, minimize environmental risk and destruction, attract investment, and forge a better future for all. If we are to meet the challenges and opportunities for a more just and sustainable future, businesses must play a major role. Dr. Awaysheh is demonstrating this through his Business Sustainability Lab by guiding businesses to embrace sustainable practices for environmental preservation and economic growth. The Lab focuses on developing sustainable strategies and technologies to help manufacturers better understand energy consumption and work on ways to lessen this consumption while still leveraging their competitive advantage. Dr. Awaysheh also leads the IU Energy Efficiency Lab and is a Research Fellow at the Center for Excellence in Manufacturing at the Kelley School of Business. He is part of a multidisciplinary, multi-institution team that received a $70 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy to advance the use of secure and energy-efficient technology in manufacturing. Since 2008, Dr. Awaysheh has managed and participated on over 60 global corporate social responsibility initiatives with Fortune 500 firms. The cumulative impact of these projects has resulted in savings of over $1.73 billion and revenue increases of over $960 million. Combined, these projects directed approximately $380 million of investments. All of this in the name of sustainability, while encouraging and embracing the basic principles of economic, social, and environmental justice found throughout the 17 SDGs. The Business Sustainability Lab Through the Business Sustainability Lab, Dr. Awaysheh works with companies to help enhance their sustainability and financial performance. This work has identified the substantial financial benefit that firms can reap by focusing largely on reducing resource consumption, such as energy and water, and eliminating waste generation within their operations. Founded in 2021, the IU Business Sustainability Lab offers years of research and on-the-ground business experience to firms seeking sustainability strategies. By turning these practices into specific, operational improvements, the lab allows companies to examine, understand, and leverage these strategies to their competitive advantage. Read more on the Business Sustainability Lab The 17 SDGs present the most urgent calls to action are for achieving a more just and sustainable future, while providing Dr. Awaysheh, his business-leading partners, students, and all of us with a universal and visionary framework for accomplishing these goals. Many of the targets within these goals encourage sustainable practices, many of which have been adopted by global companies, and the Business Sustainability Lab is working to further the embrace of these ideals and behaviors. The UN SDGs directly related to the sustainable practices encouraged by the Business Sustainability Lab include SDG 6 (Clean Water & Sanitation), SDG 7 (Affordable & Clean Energy), SDG 8 (Economic Growth & Good Jobs), SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, & Infrastructure), SDG 10 (Reduce Inequalities), and SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption & Production). In addition to strides made in achieving these goals, the Lab and Dr. Awaysheh’s work visibly embraces SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals), demonstrated in the many business, nonprofit, and community partnerships shared within the Lab and Dr. Awaysheh’s endeavors. Read more about how the Business Sustainability Lab is working to achieve these and other SDGs here . Since 2008, sustainability projects led by Dr. Awaysheh have had a measurable impact on the natural environment. Through partnerships and consultation, the Business Sustainability Lab is proving the value add of sustainability. Teaching Sustainable Operations Since the Summer of 2020, Dr. Awaysheh led a Sustainable Operations course for MBA students at the IU Kelley School of Business. The course looked at how business models and operations can change to become more sustainable – encouraging an understanding of sustainable development and corporate social responsibility. The course stressed the significance of businesses accepting the importance of environmental preservation and sustainability and explained how can discover the financial benefit of maximizing their environmental and social performances. Using the theory of the Triple Bottom Line (TBL), students learned how businesses and business leaders can examine sustainable development and corporate social responsibility and discover the beneficial trade-offs and balances of incorporating environmental, social, and financial sustainability principles and practices. This course is groundbreaking in its acceptance and engagement with the 17 SDGs, namely SDG 8 (Decent Work & Economic Growth), SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, & Infrastructure), and SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption & Production) – and, through its education of MBA students, SDG 4 (Quality Education).

Dr. Bird is also a recipient of the 2021 IUPUI Research Frontiers Trailblazer Award and the 2023 IUPUI School of Science Research Award. Dr. Bird’s research and collaborations center on climate change and water resources, and their influence on natural and anthropogenic systems. Using lake sediment archives, Dr. Bird reconstructs climate change at the highest possible resolution in order to analyze patterns and processes causing hydrological variability. The big picture is to understand the effects climate has had on human life, and the effects humans have had on the climate. Currently, Dr. Bird’s projects are concentrated in the three geographic regions: tropical South America, Tibet, and the US Midwest. The hydroclimatic systems in these regions are connected by the Pacific Ocean, which also influences climate across the globe. Understanding the hydroclimate variations and factors that drive variability in these regions is therefore critical for accurately modelling the response to climate conditions across our world. Tropical South America In a 2011 study entitled “ A 2,300-year-long annually resolved record of the South American summer monsoon from the Peruvian Andes ,” Dr. Bird and a team of researchers utilized annually resolved authigenic calcite records from Laguna Pumacocha (an alpine lake in the central Peruvian Andes) to study trends in the South American Summer Monsoon (SASM). The study revealed that the sensitivity of SASM over time is correlated to northern hemisphere temperatures, tropical sea surface temperatures, and latitudinal variability in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The results suggest that continued warming in the northern hemisphere and north Atlantic might contribute to increased weakening of SASM which could negatively impact the availability of water in the Andes and along the dry Pacific coast. Tibetan Plateau Like the South American Andes, the Tibetan plateau is a high-elevation geographic area which behaves as a natural water reservoir for a large proportion of Asia’s water needs. The water levels in this region are connected to the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) system, one of the world’s most prominent monsoon systems. In studies published in 2014 and 2016, Dr. Bird and fellow researchers discovered significant variability in the ISM by studying sediments and other material from Paru Co and Nir’pa Co (respectively), two alpine lakes in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. The 2014 Paru Co paper concludes that these changes show correlation with summer insolation levels, temperatures on the Tibetan Plateau, Indo-Pacific Surface Sea Temperatures (influenced by the El-Niño-Southern Oscillation phenomenon and the Indian Ocean Dipole), and the position of the ITCZ. In the 2016 Nir’pa Co study, a strong correlation between the El-Niño-Southern Oscillation and ISM variation in the last 3,300 years was established. US Midwest In the US Midwest, flood concerns run high because of an increase in flooding and extreme precipitation events since the 1960s. Reconstructions of floods and droughts are crucial to understanding climate patterns and factors that drive climatic variability. Dr. Bird studied sediment archives from Martin Lake, Indiana and Avery Lake, Ohio, and unearthed a surprising discovery. Before the study, the team hypothesized that flooding in the Ohio River would be reflected by flooding in the river’s tributaries such as the White River in Indiana. However, sedimentary analysis revealed that flooding coincided with the drying up of its tributaries. This discovery led to a new understanding of how river size impacts the response of the river to precipitation: smaller rivers’ water levels are influenced by rainfall while large rivers’ water levels are influenced by snowpack. Another study revealed correlations between deforestation and flooding impacts. Before the 1800s, the Midwest showed periods of frequent flooding, followed by low flooding, then a return to frequent flooding, with the cycle repeating itself. However, samples show that starting in the 1800s, in rivers all over America, flooding trends synchronized and most rivers were flooding consistently, without reverting to the cycle of high and low flooding levels. This trend was aligned with the deforestation of the eastern deciduous forest and the clearing of landscapes by settlers. With this study, Dr. Bird and his team were able to establish a correlation between land clearing and flooding levels.

Well known for his work on pollution and climate change, his current research focuses on biogeochemical cycling and the relationship between geochemistry and geologic records of climate change. Dr. Filippelli also specializes in community and public health, with a particular focus on environmental health. This includes research into nutrient cycling in oceans and on land, studying the distribution and effects of mercury in Indiana’s coal resources, and discovering links between urban lead levels and lead concentration levels is children’s blood. His work directly contributes to the UN SDG 3: Good Health and Wellbeing, SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation, SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities, and SDG 13: Climate Action. Pollution and Human Health: SDGs 3, 6 & 13 Probing the relationship between pollution and human health is a research initiative entitled “Addressing Risks of Lead in Soil and Water”. For this project, Dr. Filippelli, and IUPUI colleagues, partnered with faith organizations to distribute small plastic bottles and bags to residents to collect water and dust samples. The samples were then tested for lead and the results shared with the residents, along with information on how to protect themselves from lead exposure. In mapping lead levels in the sampled communities in Indianapolis, the research generated valuable information for promoting community health. On a global-scale, Dr. Filippelli has studied environmental pollution and health. In two separate studies, it was discovered that pollution is responsible for a large proportion of overall global heath burdens, and this disproportionately affects low-income nations and marginalized communities. Current detection and mitigation tools are inadequate for pinpointing pollution hotspots, especially in vulnerable geographies and Dr. Filippelli proposes community-based tools and techniques which have proven highly effective in producing tangible results. Global Distribution of Phosphorous: SDGs 6 & 11 The element phosphorous (P) is a limited natural resource used extensively in fertilizers. Global P is distributed unevenly across the globe with a small region (Morocco and Western Sahara) holding 75% of all global P reserves. In an article published in May 2018 , Dr. Filippelli demonstrates the dangers of current global P usage which fails to account for its uneven distribution. To efficiently utilize phosphorous to feed growing populations, Dr. Filippelli considers models that optimize P usage, while pointing out the need for further studies and for verifying the validity of the model’s predictions.

Her main research interests include risk communication and crisis management in tourism and hospitality, tourist safety and security, and employee well-being in hospitality. While her key area of expertise is crisis and risk management in tourism, most recently, Liu-Lastres studying and working to improve the role tourism and the tourism industry can play in slowing the effects of climate change and rebuilding sustainable futures following climate disasters. This focus explores elements such as employee well-being in hospitality, risk perceptions and personal protective behaviors, and organizational behavior in hospitality. The goal of Liu-Lastres' research agenda is to promote safe travel and to ensure the health and well-being of tourists, organizations and other key stakeholders within the tourism and hospitality industry. Promoting Tourism, Supporting a Sustainable Future Tourism has been widely used as an economic development tool for many developing and developed countries; meanwhile, there has been much criticism addressing the enormous pressure on a destination brought by tourism, such as increased population, natural habitat loss, and over-tourism. Contemporary society is highly risky, and recent events such as the COVID-19 pandemic have presented various challenges for the public, communities, and society. Dr. Liu-Lastres points to Daniel Wahl’s argument that the future of tourism is highly interrelated with the future of humanity, where tourism can act as both a means to reach sustainable development goals and become a catalyst for regeneration. Tourism and public understanding and engagement with sustainability are intertwined. The UN’s World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) , for instance, is a leading voice in the promotion of responsible, sustainable, and universally accessible tourism geared towards the achievement of the universal 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The 17 SDGs and their corresponding targets offer a the world a new direction, and tourism can and must play a significant role in delivering sustainable solutions for people, the planet, prosperity, and peace. Previous academic research and organizations such as the UNWTO suggest that tourism can play a particularly useful role in SDG 8 (Decent Work & Economic Growth), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption & Production), and SDG 14 (Life Below Water); however, the work of Dr. Liu-Lastres and her colleagues is proving that tourism as an industry and a participatory learning activity has the potential to contribute, directly and indirectly, to all of the 17 goals. Tourism Enhances Global Community and Encourages Sustainability Dr. Liu-Lastres’s research agenda, which surrounds risk and crisis management in tourism and hospitality, reveals a bridge between the future of humanity and our planet. She suggests that a personal level, tourism acts as one of the primary vehicles that allow society to become increasingly connected through encounters. The connection between tourists and residents not only creates transformative experiences for both parties but also leads to a strong bond and results in positive consequences such as increased residents’ support for tourism and enhanced visitor experiences. At a collective level, Dr. Liu-Lastres suggests that destinations can incorporate tourism development in their disaster relief efforts and utilize post-disaster tourism as a strategy to enhance local livelihood, build community resilience, and achieve the sustainable development goals. Across the personal and collective levels tourism can have an impact on all 17 SDG outcomes. Additionally, tourism plays an active role in facilitating public-private partnerships and co-managing major disasters for destinations and communities, which is an essential component in sustainable development and specifically spelled out under SDG 17 (Partnerships for Goals).

Liu Assistant Professor, Curriculum and Instruction Coordinator, English as a New Language (ENL) Program IUPUC Creating Funds of Knowledge Laura B. Liu is Assistant Professor and English as a New Language Program Coordinator in the Division of Education at Indiana University-Purdue University Columbus. Liu’s research and practice engages UN Sustainable Development Goal 4 on inclusive and equitable quality education, including literacy development (SDG 4.6) and cultivating knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development (SDG 4.7). Liu invites teacher candidates to interview multilingual parents in the region, and integrate insights into lesson design to support and sustain multilingual learner cultures, languages, and sociocultural identities. She has received funding from IUPUI’s Arts & Humanities Institute (2021-2022) to support multilingual parents in authoring their own children’s books to be shared and integrated into K-12 classrooms, work addressing SDG 11.4 to safeguard the world’s cultural and natural heritage. Liu also supports teacher candidates to engage elementary students in civic-science inquiry exploring connections across cultural and ecological diversity and sustainability through a local farm visit with the Bartholomew County Soil and Water Conservation District, focused on conservation of fresh water ecosystems (SDGs 6.3, 6.6., 6.b, 15.1). From this, teacher candidates author their own children’s books meeting Indiana Academic Science and Social Studies Standards that they share as lesson plans with elementary students at a local public library. Addressing SDG 11.7 and 11.a, this course also invites teacher candidates in small groups to design a Project Based Learning lesson series engaging youth to explore and sustain regional cultural and ecological diversity. This has led to lesson plans focused on sustainable park and schoolyard design. Laura’s teaching on this has been highlighted in The Republic (see http://go.iu.edu/2aRR ). Liu completed her doctoral degree in multicultural teacher education at The George Washington University (2010) and a postdoctoral degree on teacher education faculty international professional development (2014) at Beijing Normal University’s Center for Teacher Education Research, where she served as an Assistant Professor (2014-2015). Her research is shaped by three primary lines of inquiry: glocalization, diversity sustaining pedagogies, and teacher/faculty professional development. Liu has published a book, Teacher Educator International Professional Development as 仁 (Ren) (2015) and a children’s book series on environmental sustainability, initiated with Turtle’s Treasure (2014), and mentors IUPUC teacher candidates in related research presentations/publications.

Her scholarship ranges from researching issues relating to strengthening civil society, macro-social work practice, parental involvement in post-war communities and, most recently, through her Fulbright sabbatical year she started exploring the role of higher education institutions in strengthening the local capacity for development. International Partnerships for Social Justice and Global Solidarity Dr. Luca Sugawara began her journey as a global community engaged educator more than a decade ago, soon after she joined the IUSSW. With a deep commitment to the UN Sustainable Development Goals, especially relating to human rights and justice (#16) and partnerships for the goals (#17), she has provided new opportunities for social work students at Indiana University to strengthen their ability to engage with the world and find solutions to its most critical challenges. As Dr. Luca Sugawara nicely puts it: “One of our greatest challenges as a higher education institution is to focus on preparing students to fearlessly and willingly navigate complex problems – and be comfortable at what Cathy Davidson’s call “cliff’s edge”. Dr. Luca Sugawara embraces a decolonizing approach to international social work education. Together with her global educational partners, she co-designs and co-teaches international student experiences, while always remaining accountable to her hosts, local NGOs, higher education institutions, and the international development community. For example, she forged academic partnerships with two universities and UN agencies in Croatia in order to develop a novel international service-learning course for social work students. In so doing, she has helped internationalize the IUSSW curricula. She also brings Croatian students into her virtual classrooms to learn from one another and engage with the world. The International Service Learning Course: Social Work Practice in Post-War Communities has been in operation for a decade. This course was developed as a way to better prepare social work practitioners to work with communities affected by conflict. (Indianapolis is a major center for resettlement of people from war-torn countries from Burma to Afghanistan). Dr. Luca Sugawara says that these types of global community engagement courses give students the opportunity to be in the world and outside of their comfort zones, allowing for personal transformation to take place. The best way to truly learn, she says, is “…to be engaged with the unknown, to walk on new roads in new places, and have an opportunity to ask questions about yourself, the world, and the profession, outside one’s own cultural values.” Prior to joining IUPUI, Carmen was responsible for the Academy for Educational Development’s Eastern European civil society strengthening portfolio and served as a consultant for UNICEF in Romania, where she worked on developing partnership programs between governments, schools, and child welfare agencies. While undertaking research in Vukovar, a community that endured a siege and bombardment during the Croatian War of Independence in the early 1990s, she developed close ties with a non-government agency (NGO), the PRONI Centre for Social Education , as well as the University of Zagreb Department of Social Work, and the University of Osijek. Discovering the passion of her Croatian colleagues to engage youth and find ways to make their community strong again, she understood that the PRONI team and Croatia would be a valuable setting to expand the global mindedness of IU students and, more specifically, to understand the complexity of the social development arena. In Croatia they could explore the roles that social work plays in a post-war context. However, it was not just the painful stories of the war that moved Dr. Luca Sugawara to action. It was the incredible strength and creativity of the community to create new social structures, build new social spaces, and develop inclusive youth polices that was her true inspiration. With an increasing number of new Indiana residents having direct experience of war, Dr. Luca Sugawara thought it was important to expose social work students to communities that had endured ethnic conflict, so they could gain a deeper understanding and reflect on that experience in preparation for becoming social workers in post-war communities at home. Throughout the Croatia international service-learning experience, students meet with social work faculty and students from the two Croatian universities, and with local community organizations. They also have a unique opportunity to engage in dialogue with officials from UNICEF and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. As part of the service to the Croatian community, IU students are asked to develop presentations on youth services as they pertain to improving social skills, employability and voluntarism of youth in Indiana. They also engage in street events, support organizational strategic planning, and undertake their own research. After eighteen days abroad, students participate in a community forum to (a) share lessons learned with local community members, and (b) publicly acknowledge and thank the host community for their role in student learning. Nicole Ridge’s digital story echoes the type of learning that takes place in this course. As one student, Mason Hutcheson, wrote, “Having had the privilege of traveling to Croatia to see social work practice in a post-war community has enabled me to develop a clearer vision for professional social work in Indiana… The importance of networking, cooperating, and seeking to understand are now central concepts guiding my work with agencies, government programs and colleagues.” A 2017 graduate student, after returning home, she was invited to meet with the school superintendent from Richmond to discuss new ways of partnerships between schools and community organizations (as she witnessed them taking place in Croatia).

Fairbanks School of Public Health Expanding Knowledge and Access Dr. Gerardo Maupomé is Professor and Associate Dean of Research in the Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health (FSPH) at Indiana University. He was a Professor with the IU School of Dentistry from 2005 until 2017. He also has multiple adjunct/affiliated positions within IU, including the Indiana University Network Science Institute and in 2020, he became Associate Director of the Community Health Partnerships (CHeP), with the Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute. Dr. Maupomé’s work focuses on dental public health, population health, dental health services, global health, social and behavioral sciences, and health disparities. The International Association for Dental Research (IADR) recognized his work in 2019 as a co-recipient of 2019 Giddon Award for Distinguished Research in the Behavioral Sciences , and in 2022 he received an IADR Distinguished Scientist Award . In 2021, he was also recognized by the IUPUI Center for Translating Research Into Practice with the 2021 Bantz-Petronio TRIP Faculty Award . Research Interests Dr. Maupomé’s research interests align with the SDGs and include epidemiological studies assessing the impact of public health fluoridation, clinical trials of chlorhexidine varnishes, and the promotion of healthier lifestyles. He is also engaged in appraisals of factors contributing to poor oral health and the failure to access dental services, with particular attention to the social and economic determinants of health. Many of his studies have been focused on Native Americans, people of Hispanic origin, those 65 years of age and older, children, and population groups with restricted access to dental services. Current Projects Dr. Maupome is currently the Chief Innovation Officer with the IUPUI ECHO Center , where the goal is to improve clinical and public health practices in real life. Project ECHO uses technology to leverage scarce resources, reduce disparities in care by de-monopolizing knowledge, provide case-based learning to enhance mastery of complex information and increase impact, and monitor outcomes. Project Echo is a partnership between local primary care providers and the Fairbanks school to improve access to high quality treatment for common, complex and chronic diseases, with support from interdisciplinary teams of medical specialists. Dr. Maupomé is also leading an NIH-funded, six-year study on the oral health status, dental care use, mental health, and overall well-being of Hispanics in Indiana. The link between access to clinical services and social dynamics among Hispanic immigrants has been a long-standing focus of Dr. Maupomé’s work. By identifying the evolution of personal and community networks and the impact of such network factors in improving or undermining health outcomes, this project is affording a unique perspective to leverage future interventions. Another significant study conducted by Dr. Maupomé and his team focused on the impact of sugar consumption on dental health among Hispanic immigrants. Data were analyzed for the ties between high sugar consumption and decline in dental health and a manual to support the exploration and discovery of dental issues for people otherwise left out of the dental care market was developed. This resource grew organically from focus groups, key informant interviews, administering a survey to about 200 immigrants, and analyzing data. The manual is entitled “ Dental Health Inequities Affecting Central Americans: Enabling Choices at the Grass-Root Level and Supporting Change in Policy-Makers ”. Additional research addressing SDGs 3, 10, and 17 is Dr. Maupome’s work on a Hispanic-focused survey in collaboration with the IU Simon Cancer Center about the state of health and cancer throughout Indiana. An earlier survey gathered considerable information about ‘mainstream’ residents in Indiana, whereas the new approach sampled those segments of the Hispanic population most likely to have been undercounted in the first survey. The research expands the knowledge base about risk factors, perceptions, attitudes and behaviors related to cancer experience and cancer treatment overall. A further example of Dr. Maupome’s SDG-related work is an assessment of COVID-19 impacts on Hispanics. There is little doubt that Hispanics are one of the groups hardest hit by the COVID-19 epidemic. They often are hourly workers with unstable employment and inadequate benefits; undocumented immigrants who are not eligible for public assistance protection or access to health care; persons with limited schooling who are less able to navigate government support opportunities; and living as isolated families or individuals who may not have peers to rely on when catastrophic financial situations arise. To address gaps in the COVID-19 body of knowledge relevant to Hispanics, Dr. Maupome designed a survey to support the assembling of reliable, context-specific, and actionable resources for the community to meet health challenges. Expanding such knowledge about the health of vulnerable communities in Indiana is key to improving health outcomes. Such dedicated research and its application can make significant headway in ameliorating health disparities in our state. Glocalization and Hispanic Immigrants - Making the World a Better Place with the SDGs Gerardo Maupomé presented his work in a 5-minute video as a part of the 2022 IUPUI International Festival - IUPUI SDG Day.

Dr. Pastakia specializes in diabetes and chronic disease management in low and middle-income countries, care delivery in remote and rural areas, fortifying pharmacy distribution systems in impoverished nations, and supply chain construction for essential medications. Dr. Pastakia is also involved with the largest trade union of women in the world, the Self-Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) in India, working to build a model of healthcare delivery for the association’s members. He is also involved in COVID-19 education and treatment for underserved populations in central Indiana. Dr Pastakia held a Jefferson Science Fellowship with the USAID Africa Bureau for Sustainable Development in Washington D.C. and has served on the medical board of Direct Relief. He also works as principal investigator or co-investigator on several grants for the National Institutes of Health, United Kingdom Medical Research Council, and USAID. Ongoing Projects A key focus of Dr. Pastakia’s research and service is understanding and addressing global healthcare inequities. One area of focus is the Bridging Income Generation with Group Integrated Care (BIGPIC), an initiative of the IU-led and Nobel prize-nominated Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare (AMPATH) program in rural Kenya. BIGPIC integrates chronic and non-communicable disease healthcare with economic sustainability education, with a vision of providing healthcare while simultaneously addressing underlying barriers to access of health among low and middle-income populations. BIGPIC hosts seminars for patients on strategies for income generation and healthcare education. During these seminars, BIGPIC also utilizes mobile diagnosis and treatment devices to detect diabetes and hypertension among participants, and provides treatment. Dr. Pastakia is also co-author of a medicine textbook chapter focusing on global health and travel medicine. His goal is to educate readers about health disparities between global regions, causes and barriers that create these disparities, and provide an analysis of such factors in different continents. This is also the subject of Dr. Pastakia’s article entitled “The Unpaid Debt of Underinvestment in Public Health”. From his experience with AMPATH and BIGPIC in Kenya, Dr. Pastakia outlines the consequences of poor investment or neglect in the provision public health services. His response is to emphasize strong intersectoral collaborations for addressing socio-economic constraints to medical health access. Specifically, he presents the case of AMPATH to show how a multi-faceted program that provides holistic healthcare and economic education can help neutralize disparities in public health, and he calls for the adoption of models similar to AMPATH in other settings. Reciprocal Innovation Key to Dr. Pastakia’s research and service is the concept of reciprocal innovation – taking lessons learnt in one academic research setting and applying it to a different setting to address similar problems. For example, Dr. Pastakia is applying the lessons from Kenya in underserved communities in Indiana. Indiana is currently ranked 41 out of 48 in health outcomes in the US, and 48th in public health funding, and multiple counties experience life expectancies lower than those found in some regions of Kenya. Populations of underperforming counties in Indiana are now the beneficiaries of community-based models that integrate socio-economic development and healthcare. Research indicates that the United States is one of the highest spenders in clinical healthcare. However, this expenditure fails to translate into positive health outcomes. Dr. Pastakia’s work suggests that the key factors limiting positive health include a disproportionate distribution of health resources, which severely limits access for low-income populations in the US. An approach which only addresses one of the four social determinants of health cannot prevail. The BIGPIC approach to healthcare wherein all the four social determinants of health (socioeconomic factors, physical environment, health behaviors, and health care) are considered and addressed, is at the heart of reciprocal innovation. By organizing small microfinance groups, educating participants on productive labor and agricultural practices, educating on healthy lifestyles, and providing portable, on-the-spot treatment, the BIGPIC initiative has been able to substantially reduce hypertension in Kenyan participants, with a parallel increase in the number of patients who return for treatment after testing positive for a chronic disease like diabetes or hypertension. Dr. Pastakia anticipates similar positive outcomes in Indiana and India.

A Herron School of Art and Design Associate Professor of Photography and Intermedia, Petranek is driven by anxiety for the future of our planet. Through his work, he seeks to create a dialogue with his viewers about the true status of our planet, and how contemporary culture, through advances in science and technology, affects our perception of nature, how we define it, and what we must do to protect it. Petranek’s 2019 IUPUI exhibition, ‘The Future Is Broken’ , and the subsequent 2021 Dittmar Gallery at Northwestern University exhibition ‘Anthro-obsence: what we choose not to see’, represent a personal response to what he describes as an obscenity: the current lack of action on climate change, despite ample knowledge of its reality and consequences. In a recent interview, the artist described how his work attempts to expose what is happening to our landscapes beyond what meets the eye. “These landscapes often can look just fine and normal, and our capacity to understand how they’re changing is really limited,” Petranek said. “When we can start to comprehend or recognize how those spaces or those landscapes are going to be changed by climate change, we feel like we have a much closer connection to it and concern for it.” Petranek’s penetrating photographic style overlays climate science data onto landscapes of personal significance in order to visualize what is often hidden from plain sight. Incorporating laser etched photographs, Pixelstick light exposures and projection mapped video sculptures, his work looks broadly at how our pristine and idealized North American and other landscapes are being overwritten by searing heat and turbulent waters. The changing landscape is captured, frozen in time, as a mirror to the paralyzed response--or lack of response--by governments and peoples. Petranek's work asks us not only to imagine a future, but reckon with the reality of the present and to reject these static images as inevitabilities.

Led by Christine Picard , an associate professor at the School of Science at IUPUI, and Yunlong Liu , a professor of medical and molecular genetics at the IU School of Medicine, researchers at The Center for Environmental Sustainability Through Insect Farming benefit from collaborations with Texas A&M AgriLife Research, and Mississippi State University, as well as key industry members, including 30 companies in the US and around the world. This innovative research addresses many of the challenges identified in the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 2030 Agenda, including hunger, health and wellbeing, and climate change. According to the UN’s Food and Agricultural Organization , it is estimated that traditional agriculture will fall about 40 percent short of the world’s food needs by 2050. The researchers at The Center for Environmental Sustainability Through Insect Farming believe that insect farming can provide a practical, economical, and sustainable path for producing nutritional food options and reducing agricultural waste. According to Picard, this is possible because certain insects are suitable for use as feed for animals such as fish, poultry, and swine, as well as in food products consumed by pets and humans. An initiative that reaches across the disciplines at IUPUI, The Center for Environmental Sustainability Through Insect Farming benefits greatly from the participants’ unique research specializations. while simultaneously having them engage with professional, regulatory, and governmental bodies to enhance public understanding and adoption. IUPUI researchers will focus on the genetic aspects of insects for food and feed, while collaboratively the center will conduct multidisciplinary laboratory and field experiments to advance new knowledge and technologies to fill critical scientific and industrial gaps. Why Insects? Population Growth, Climate Change, and Food Security As our planet continues to react to the stress of a growing population and the effects of climate change, we as a global community are realizing the impacts these phenomena are having on our future food security, health, and wellbeing. According to UN statistics , from the 1950s to the present our global population has increased over 250%, from 2.6 billion to around 7.9 billion. Population projections for the year 2050 are over 10 billion people. At this rate of growth, no county in the world will be able to meet the food and wellbeing demands of its citizens while also adjusting to the ongoing changes in climate and environment. Population dynamics are at the center of the climate change-food security nexus. Not only does population growth contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, it also drives demand for food. Likewise, economic progress towards higher standards of living often influences changing diets toward animal-based products, which are typically more resource-intensive and display higher environmental impacts. Insect farming and harvesting for both livestock and human consumption is a well-thought-out response to the major challenges identified in the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 2030 Agenda. This new initiative at IUPUI will have direct implications for achieving food security (SDG 2 – End Hunger), encouraging good health and wellbeing (SDG 3 – Good Health and Wellbeing), conserving and developing life below water (SDG 14 – Life Below Water) and on land (SDG 15 – Life on Land), and combating climate change and its impacts (SDG 13 – Climate Action). IUPUI researchers are also working with partners in the IU Business Sustainability and Innovation Lab led by Amrou Awaysheh to explore how scaling-up and expanding insect farming could have positive and sustainable economic implications in employment and revenue generation (SDG 8 – Decent Work and Economic Growth) and responsible production and consumption (SDG 12 – Responsible Consumption and Production).

Director, Lugar Center for Renewable Energy Professor of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Purdue School of Engineering & Technology IUPUI Biographical Sketch Dr. Peter Schubert is a Professor of electrical and computer engineering and the Director of the Richard G. Lugar Center for Renewable Energy (LCRE) at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) . Dr. Schubert holds 43 US patents, is the author of over 100 technical publications, and is the principal investigator on research projects from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Department of Energy (DOE), the US Department of Defense (DOD), the National Science Foundation (NSF) and NASA, all related to renewable energy, energy harvesting, and sustainability. A key aspect of Dr. Schubert’s work – and the primary mission of LCRE – is to support and produce interdisciplinary research for the purposes of promoting renewable energy solutions and sustainable energy applications. Outside of LCRE at IUPUI, Dr. Schubert is an instructor with the Society of Automotive Engineers, the global leader in technical learning for the mobility industry, and has taught over 1,000 engineers from 17 countries in systems engineering and mechatronics system design. He has served as a technical fellow for Delphi Electronics and as a space, energy, and education research consultant for Packer Engineering, Inc., becoming recognized as a technology leader in multiple disciplines and an expert in areas such as renewable energy, fuel cells, environmental engineering, and sustainability. His work within and beyond the academy demonstrates his emphasis on translating research into practice so to positively impact lives and communities, a quality that recently earned him IUPUI’s Bantz-Petronio Translating Research into Practice Faculty Award (the “TRIP Award”). The Lugar Center for Renewable Energy At LCRE technology, research, and education converge to form solutions for a clean, sustainable energy future – improving energy security and mitigating the negative impacts of climate change. Established in 2007, LCRE began as a research center to discover and promote excellence in self-sufficiency and renewable energy with a mission of addressing the societal needs for clean and affordable energy sources and efficient use. To date, LCRE researchers have collaborated in discovering biofuels from local resources, developing hydrogen fuel cells, and increasing efficient use and storage of energy through other innovative technologies. An important belief of the late US Senator Richard Lugar, for whom the Center is named, was putting research into practice and applying what has and is being done in the university to the world at large. This agenda to create knowledge, support job creation, and benefit the public’s access to and use of sustainable energy resources has remained unchanged for 14 years. LCRE currently hosts 44 research members from multiple disciplines who support approximately 60 students, interns, and post-doctoral researchers, all of whom benefit from 13 external advisory experts. Collectively, Dr. Schubert and other LCRE members are pioneering renewable energy technologies and these groundbreaking innovations directly align with identified targets for achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the 2030 Agenda. Local research making a global impact: an integrated, holistic approach for sustainability Dr. Schubert, alongside fellow LCRE researchers and other IUPUI colleagues, is providing cutting-edge solutions to climate change issues and fostering sustainable development through integrated and coherent renewable energy innovations. His expertise in fuel cell technology and bio-fuel production and consumption is positively impacting the lives of those most vulnerable around the globe, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. Key to IUPUI, LCRE, and the Purdue School of Engineering and Technology at IUPUI’s efforts to lessen the devastation of climate change, preserve our environment, and further efforts in sustainable development is Dr. Schubert’s biomass conversation initiative. This work is reducing agricultural waste, promoting sustainable energy use, and bringing new technology, for both the purposes of education and employment opportunities, to those in underserved and remote areas. This revolutionary system uses a biomass gasifier that is designed to break down crop residue and agricultural waste using high heat, breaking the waste into the simplest possible components while eliminating toxic externalities. The gas created can be used for electricity, presenting greater opportunities for education, healthcare and medical devices, and upscaling manufacturing operations. Through this initiative Dr. Schubert believes that the 1.2 billion people on the planet without access to reliable electricity will see interrelated socio-economic benefits, including: sustainable access to clean water; increased accessibility to knowledge for education; the ability to utilize electrical lighting for schooling and industry; greater efficiency in agricultural activity and less desertification; and improved connectivity to information and resources for political and social justice issues. Every aspect of this project is directly aligned with the 2030 Agenda and targets the achievement of the SDGs. The problems of today and solutions for tomorrow cannot be achieved with the tools of yesterday. Engineering is necessary for the development of tools for new, sustainable solutions. The research and innovation headed by Dr. Schubert is proving an effective response to the complex development challenges countries face. His contributions present a multifaceted approach to achieving the SDGs. One of the main aims of the biomass conversion program, for instance, is to lessen the negative impacts of current indoor cooking and heating techniques used in parts of Africa ( SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy ), which are destructive to the surrounding natural environment ( SDG 15: Life on Land ) and harmful to one’s personal health ( SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being ). An initiative such as this can provide people with electrical heating and cooking options, preserving natural resources and personal well-being. Specifically, the biomass conversation project makes progress toward these SDGs: SDG 1: Reducing Poverty – Access to electricity can allow for the expansion of industrial productivity and the creation of employment opportunities for communities in need. SDG 2: Zero Hunger – Access to electricity can limit food spoilage and enhance food security. Additionally, a biproduct of the conversion process known as biochar can be recycled to improve agricultural practices by enriching and naturally augmenting the soil. SDG 15: Life on Land & SDG 13 : Climate Action – The use of biochar to improve farmland, coupled with the access to electricity and the limited need for local natural resources for cooking and heating fires, can prevent desertification and the climatological impacts the destruction of an ecosystem and land can cause. SDG 12 : Responsible Consumption and Production – The conversion process can allow for the sustainable production of hydrogen that can be captured, stored, and used in fuel cells that could power clean and efficient agriculture equipment, protecting the environment while increasing crop yields. Additionally, as Dr. Schubert explains, this biomass technology could provide a continuous, around-the-clock baseload of power to a rural and underserved community or village, helping the individuals within the area achieve a greater quality of life through the use of water pumps ( SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation ), better access to internet infrastructure ( SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure ), availability of online resources and information for education ( SDG 4: Quality Education ), and proper lighting for safer and more productive work conditions ( SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth ). This initiative will provide developing nations and communities an avenue to enter and equally participate in the global economy ( SDG 10: Reducing Inequalities ) without causing the environmental and ecological damage that developed nations caused during their own route to industrialization. Engineers play a crucial role in creating infrastructure for the world. They apply knowledge and experience to innovatively meet human needs, protecting the environment while progressing towards sustainable development. Dr. Schubert and his colleagues are doing just this, and it is his goal to further diversify his interdisciplinary partnership network within and beyond the IUPUI community so to successfully reach the goals necessary for the 2030 Agenda.

Scott, PhD, is a Research Professor who teaches as part of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at IUPUI’s School of Science. Dr. Scott earned his Bachelor of Arts (BA), Chemistry, from Williams College in 1967, and went on to obtain his PhD in Organic Chemistry from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1972, followed by postdoctoral positions at Rockefeller University and CalTech. His academic career led to industry where Dr. Scott worked as a Research Scientist at Eli Lilly and Company for 27 years. In January 2002, Dr. Scott joined IUPUI as a Research Professor to engage in teaching and research. This move set the stage for a global collaboration in the effort to produce drugs for diseases in the developing world. D3: Distributed Drug Discovery In today’s society, pharmaceutical companies play a crucial role in the development of drugs. However, due to their capitalist philosophy, these companies focus on drug development for developed countries since this is where drug sales are high, in turn boosting profits. On the flip side, this means that pharmaceutical companies do not have an incentive to produce drugs for infectious diseases in the developing world, leading to a lack of drugs for diseases in low-GDP countries. Diseases for which drugs are not commonly available are often termed Neglected Diseases. An example of a neglected disease is Afghan Leishmaniasis which affects numerous Afghans every year. With many diseases globally falling under the neglected or infectious diseases category, Dr. Scott devised a method to convert the traditional pharmaceutical drug discovery process into a discovery process which splits the large units of the traditional discovery process into smaller, manageable, and resource-efficient steps. This program was termed D3: Distributed Drug Discovery. The D3 program is powerful as it utilizes simple, efficient, inexpensive procedures and apparatus in conjunction with global collaborations and pre-existing educational networks. With Dr. Martin O’Donnell at IUPUI the first D3 chemistry laboratories were designed and successfully piloted in the 2004-2005 academic year. With that, Dr. Scott worked tirelessly to expand the program with global collaborators. Through an international recruitment tour in 2004, Dr. Scott identified three partners – University of Barcelona (Spain), Moscow State University (Russia), and Lublin Medical University (Poland) – and the first global D3 labs were implemented and started functioning. After setting up the labs, they initiated the synthesis of new molecules, and subsets of those compounds were replicated at the four global sites. These results validated D3’s ability to bring students and educators together across geographic and political boundaries, and aid drug discovery in a powerful and resourceful method. Expansion and Potential of D3 After the initial establishment of D3 global sites, and a 2009 publication co-authored by Spanish, Polish, and Russian authors, D3 achieved global recognition for its effectiveness and potential. In 2010, Dr. Scott received an invitation from Solomon Nwaka (then at the World Health Organization, Geneva) to attend the 13 th African Network for Drugs and Diagnostics (ANDI) Stakeholders Meeting in Nairobi, Kenya. Here, Dr. Scott was able to learn about the opportunities and challenges for D3 in Africa. Collaborations for global sites grew with partners from Cuba, Czech Republic, Mexico City, Puerto Rico, Australia, and continental USA. In 2013, the Inaugural International Distributed Drug Discovery workshop was organized at IUPUI by Dr. Scott. This event brought together synthetic chemists, computational chemists, and biologists from Poland, Czech Republic, Kenya, and four schools in the US with the agenda of the workshop being improvements to D3 and the building of further collaborations. Results of D3: Synthesis of potent molecules and reagents Since the conception of D3, students and researchers have actively participated in the synthesis of molecules with antimicrobial activity. Over the years, the powerful compounds that can be potentially produced by the D3 collaboration have been virtually cataloged. Since their synthesis is based on simple, resource-effective processes, consistently reproducible globally and with the simplest of equipment, conversion from “virtual” to “real” has a high probability of success. Furthermore, subsets of compounds available in the virtual catalog have been made by students and tested at the Australian Community for Open Antimicrobial Drug Discovery (CO-ADD) – a partner of D3. The results have led to the identification of novel student-made antimicrobial molecules, patents, and even a publication co-authored by collaborators from schools in Cuba, Australia, and four American schools. Another example of the success of D3 came after students from workshops in Puerto Rico and Mexico collaborated with students from four American schools to produce 42 new molecules which were tested by IUPUI biology students for activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a cause of serious infections in patients with Cystic Fibrosis. A number of these compounds showed potential activity. Similarly, after the global influx of COVID-19 in 2020, a new undergraduate lab at IUPUI was created following the D3 protocol to produce numerous potential inhibitors of “Mpro”, an enzyme essential for the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. D3 and Scientific Diplomacy Discovery Drug Discovery (D3) has demonstrated its potential for producing disease-fighting compounds for diseases which are commonly neglected by the traditional drug discovery processes employed by large pharmaceutical companies. However, D3 has also shown advantages and capability in other avenues such as producing employment opportunities and providing research and development opportunities for students. One of the biggest avenues of benefits from D3 is Scientific Diplomacy fostered by a common goal which transcends borders and politics. The D3 collaboration with the University of Havana is a testament to the scientific diplomacy which this program offers. Despite political tensions between the US and Cuba over the past few years, D3 collaborations have always been focused on disseminating knowledge and experience between the two countries. Furthermore, D3 does not impose first-world technologies on countries such as Cuba. Instead, the program empowers developing nations to effectively use available resources and educate students to produce powerful drugs. In the spirit of scientific research and education conducted without geographical or political constraints Dr. Scott is extending the D3 program to Ukraine. He is scheduled in November to deliver three remote lectures on drug discovery and D3 to students and researchers in Kyiv, Ukraine. When safety permits he will travel to Kyiv to oversee a synthesis workshop and connect Ukraine to the widening network of D3 collaborators.

An active participant in community engagement programs and research, Dr. Parrish-Sprowl is dedicated to improving health and clinical communication for the greater good. Dr. Parrish-Sprowl has served as a senior member of the Community Health Engagement Program (CHEP), World Health Organization (WHO) Roster of Experts for Social and Behavioral Change, and the Assembly of the National Communication Association. Additionally, he has worked on research projects from USAID, NIH, and private foundations. As an award-winning educator and consultant, Dr. Parrish-Sprowl is renowned for his expertise in international applied communication research for Universal Health Coverage (UHC), Malaria eradication, mitigating vaccine hesitancy through better communication, and mental health services in humanitarian settings. Vaccine Hesitancy Within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world witnessed the danger of widespread vaccine hesitancy. Dr. Parrish-Sprowl, in 2017, authored an article – “Vaccine Hesitancy Communication: What counts as evidence” - which analyzed the significance of how individuals attach value to evidence regarding the efficacy or danger of a vaccine. The article highlights patient-provider interactions as playing a significant role in addressing vaccine hesitancy. Dr. Parrish-Sprowl purports that the message is not the only factor that can persuade a hesitant patient to receive a vaccine; rather, the way in which the message is conveyed plays a significant role in alleviating anxiety and hesitancy among patients. When a patient receives a message through a conversation with the healthcare provider, the information (considered evidence) is processed depending on how the patient feels. If the patient perceives the conversation to be adversarial, this puts them in a state of mind which is reactive and/or defensive. When this happens, their brain processes the information slightly differently, making the patient less likely to count the message of the healthcare provider as valuable evidence. Therefore, Dr. Parish-Sprowl theorizes that communication research regarding vaccine hesitancy must include the nature of the conversation, rather than sticking to the message. This, in turn, will produce solutions which help healthcare providers have interactions that reduce vaccine hesitancy. By helping to break down misinformation, research of this kind can have significant impacts on improving the health and well-being of individuals, while also acting to bridge inequality between different communities. WHO: Fighting Malaria Malaria eradication, and improving vaccine uptake, has been key to Dr. Parrish-Sprowl’s work with the WHO. A 2019 WHO report on malaria eradication – in which Dr. Parrish-Sprowl was a contributor – highlights strategies utilized in the past to stem this disease, and the recommended course of action to eradicate it. The Global Malaria Eradication Program (GMEP - 1955 to 1969) eliminated malaria in many countries but a resurgence killed millions. Today, the WHO continues its work to eradicate the disease, with an emphasis on sub-Saharan Africa, a demographic where GMEP was not implemented. The action plan to which Dr. Parrish-Sprowl contributed, recommends customizing implementation within the context of each country. Another critical WHO project of Dr. Parrish-Sprowl was to develop the Global Action Plan (GAP) to improve influenza vaccine uptake. This 2016 report highlights the uniqueness of influenza vaccines which change annually due to mutations of the virus, and the importance of scaling vaccine production to match the ever-changing needs of influenza vaccines. However, the report highlights that an increase in vaccine production does not correlate with an increase in uptake of the vaccine. In this regard, the report highlights key communication strategies to address the emotions of patients, thereby hopefully increasing vaccine uptake. Addressing Mental Health Needs Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) is a domain in the humanitarian health sector that focuses on providing mental health services to refugees. In many countries, refugees face intense psychological distress caused by stressors such as migration, war, and injury, and this can lead to long-lasting trauma. To such patients, MHPSS aids in the processing of trauma. In a 2020 case study, Dr. Parrish-Sprowl collaborated with two other experts to develop a system of intervention for a large Jordanian Healthcare NGO to address the mental health needs of staff and patients. A Communications for Whole Health (CWH) intervention framework, and a Communication Complex (CC) perspective were utilized. The CC perspective regards communication as more than the transfer of messages between individuals; rather, it focusses on the process, pattern, and perturbations that distinguish the dynamic linkages between humans and their environment. Human interaction is seamlessly intertwined with our biology and helps shape our health and well-being. The CWH intervention framework is an implementation of the CC perspective which aims to systemically integrate MHPSS services throughout primary healthcare settings, in contrast to the conventional view where MHPSS acts separately (or as an add-on) to primary healthcare. Between 2015 and 2017, Dr. Parrish-Sprowl and his team in the Global Health Communication Center (GHCC) designed and implemented the CWH and CC system at the Jordanian healthcare facility, producing noted changes in mental health and overall well-being outcomes among patients, and staff.

A professor of earth sciences in the IUPUI School of Science, Dr. Wang’s cutting-edge work on the UN Sustainable Development Goals has also resulted in grant funding in excess of $3 million. In addition, he is a reviewer and editor of major international journals including Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, Nature, Nature Climate Change, Nature Geoscience, and Journal of Hydrology. Water and vegetation are critical to the Earth’s natural processes, and Dr. Wang’s research involves studying spatial and temporal patterns of water and nutrient availability, how vegetation adapts to and affects these patterns, and how future climate/land use changes affect vegetation-resources interactions. This research directly contributes to SDG 2: Zero Hunger, SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation, SDG 12: Responsible Production and Consumption, and SDG 13: Climate Action. Drivers of Ecological Change in Drylands Drylands are land with limited natural water supply and can include deserts, parched land, and dry non-desert areas. About 40% of the Earth’s land surface is classified as drylands and this environment is home to approximately 2.5 billion people. A key aspect of Dr. Wang’s work is to investigate the effect of non-rainfall water sources in dryland ecosystems, especially contributions from fog and dew. Dr. Wang’s research used stable isotope techniques to show the surprisingly numerous origins of source water for fog and dew formation in deserts and that these have important implications for future changes of fog and dew dynamics. It also shown that it is possible to use satellite data to study the impact of fog levels on vegetation health in drylands. The Redwood Forests in California, the Atacama Desert in Chile, and the Namib Desert in Namibia all depend on fog as one major water source. The novel technique of studying climate factors using stable isotopes and satellite data has greatly improved the efficiency and accuracy of investigations. These research studies and their subsequent findings allow us to understand and mitigate climate change impacts, thus making them significant for SDG 13. Impact of Environmental Changes on Vegetation Global climate change, including a rise in atmospheric CO 2 levels and reductions in water levels, have crucial implications for vegetation across the globe. Dr. Wang’s research into the effects that global climatic deviations have had on plant life in the past allows researchers to build accurate models of future vegetation growth. One study by Dr. Wang’s group analyzed greening of areas traditionally classified as drylands in the Mediterranean, Middle East, Mongolia and South America. After considering other factors such as increased rainfall and altered agricultural practices, Dr. Wang concluded that increasing atmospheric CO 2 concentrations provide the key explanation for global dryland greening. Between 1960 and 2015, carbon dioxide levels have risen approximately 27%. The increased CO 2 levels augment soil water levels through higher efficiency in water use by plants, thus causing greening, but further investigation is necessary to understand the long-term effects of dryland greening. Dr. Wang reports that determining whether the greening of drylands is good or bad, also requires further investigation. Another study conducted by Dr. Wang’s group investigated the effect that rising global temperatures and CO 2 levels have on vegetation water needs in the northern hemisphere. This novel and large-scale research used satellite remote sensing data to show that increased atmospheric temperatures and CO 2 levels are reducing water availability to vegetation, thereby stunting the growth of plants. While general increases in carbon dioxide promote vegetation growth, this study indicates that water limitations arising from temperature changes are hampering plant growth. Therefore, Dr. Wang and his colleagues see an urgent need to significantly reduce CO 2 emissions in a bid to reduce warmer temperatures. The results make these objectives significant for SDG 12 and 13. Climate Change and Agriculture Agriculture is a significant source of human and animal food. Projected demand for food over the next few decades is astronomical, making food supply chains and production systems paramount. In recent history, climate change has caused extreme weather events, such as droughts, that severely impact crop yields. Furthermore, agricultural practices can also exacerbate climate change through greenhouse gas emissions and water pollution. Dr. Wang’s research delves into both these aspects in a bid to produce knowledge which can help mitigate the effects that they have on each other. One study provided insight on the factors which affect legume yield during drought. The study showed a positive correlation between yield reduction and water availability reduction, but the magnitude of the impact depended on the legume and the stage of the crop’s life cycle. Soil textures were also found to have an effect on legume yield, revealing subtle nuances which must be considered to minimize loss of legume yield during drought conditions. Agriculture contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and runoffs that affect aquatic ecosystems. One technique which has become increasingly common is no-till farming: Soil is left undisturbed without tilling, allowing organic matter to build up in the soil. The technique is touted for its ability to reduce soil erosion and nutrient contamination of water. However, Dr. Wang’s research has discovered that this technique in fact increases nitrate leaching, a common cause of water pollution. This study is critical as it highlights the need to understand agricultural practices and implement them in a manner which minimizes environmental effects. Building on these findings, Dr. Wang and his colleagues have received a $500K United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) grant in 2021 to study the impact of combining no-till and cover cropping on greenhouse gas emissions and nutrient leaching. Such studies are critical to SDGs 2, 6, 12, and 13.

Together, they planted a sapling that had grown from the seeds of a remarkable tree in Hiroshima, Japan, which had endured the atomic bombing of the city in 1945, surviving for over 300 years! This sapling is part of the Green Legacy Hiroshima project, dedicated to promoting global peace and imparting knowledge about the far-reaching impacts of nuclear weapons. IUPUI's involvement in this initiative is a collaborative endeavor between the Japanese Studies Program and the Office of International Affairs. The IUPUI Japanese Studies Program, led by Dr. Keiko Kuriyama, in partnership with the IUPUI Office of International Affairs and the IUPUI Greenhouse, are cooperating with the Hiroshima Green Legacy Project to bring seeds from the few remaining trees that survived the Hiroshima A-Bomb blast of 1945 to the IUPUI campus and across Indiana. Linked to UN Sustainable Development Goal 16 on peacebuilding, the Hiroshima Green Legacy Project ( summarized in this YouTube video) was established to spread the seeds of Hiroshima's A-Bomb ‘survivor trees’ worldwide as a gesture of reconciliation and peacebuilding. With the planting of this 3-year-old sapling on the IUPUI campus alongside Democracy Plaza in Taylor Square, IUPUI became active ambassadors of this peace message. The goal of the IUPUI Japanese Studies Program is to educate the public on the devastating consequences of nuclear weapons and thus contribute to the United Nations goal of promoting peaceful and inclusive societies at the national level, and cooperation at the international level. The next stage of the project is to share more Hiroshima seeds and seedlings with other communities in Indiana, including secondary schools, colleges, churches, parks, and arboretums. The planting ceremony at IUPUI was attended by senior IUPUI administrators and faculty members in the School of Liberal Arts, and community dignitaries, including Jeremy Kranowitz, the director of Keep Indianapolis Beautiful, and Charlie Wiles, the director of the Center for Interfaith Communication. See an excerpt from the official press release below: Click to view the full press release Ginkgo tree with historic roots in Hiroshima is planted as a symbol of peace at IUPUI: News at IU: Indiana University Amber Denney ...The highlight of the event, which was organized and managed with the help of students in E384: East Asian Nationalism and Cultural Identity, a class taught by Dr. Izumi Harris, was the heart-felt presentations by students. Their personal reflections on the impact of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki through music, art, poetry and other forms of expression was described by them as their own personal ‘peace declaration.’ The origins of the planting at IUPUI go back to March 2020 when the Japanese Studies Program hosted the \"Hiroshima Nagasaki A-bomb Poster Exhibition\" at the Cultural Arts Gallery at the IUPUI Campus Center, along with a symposium \"Hibakusha (Survivor) testimony: Hiroshima 1945 to the U.S. 2020\". The symposium included the testimony of Dr. Hideko Tamura, an A-Bomb survivor and founder of One Sunny Day Initiatives. A Hiroshima Peace Ambassador, Dr. Tamura is also an ambassador for the Hiroshima Green Legacy Project, which is where the idea for planting the tree at IUPUI was born. The Spring E384 class taught by Prof. Izumi Harris included zoom lectures from Hiroshima survivor Kiyomi Kono, and Mr Steven Leeper, former Chairperson of the Hiroshima Peace Culture Foundation. Dr. Harris believes that an important role of higher education is to help students develop a sense of humanity in their attitudes towards all challenging social issues. In her previous teaching experience at Nanjing University in China, Dr. Harris’ taught Japanese language and culture to Chinese youth. How did she address the 1937 Rape of Nanjing by the Japanese during the class? Hatreds run very deep, but in an exercise designed to build trust, she conducted a fieldtrip for her Chinese students to the Memorial Hall of the Victims and then led a discussion on ways to build peace through compassion, empathy, apology and forgiveness. That same degree of sensitivity is evident in her work on the topic of Hiroshima and Nagasaki at IUPUI. Some will argue that the A-Bomb was a necessary evil to end WW2, while others say that Japan can never be forgiven for the atrocities that they committed in Manchuria and Nanjing, but Dr. Harris has taken on this challenge and focused her efforts on relationship-building and reconciliation. After the IUPUI planting ceremony, Dr. Harris’ students provided glowing feedback. They were thankful to have had an opportunity to help in organizing the event and to present their work to the assembled group of invited guests. Several students commented that the process of working on their peace declarations had changed their lives and given them a direction for the future they did not have previously, a powerful testament to the importance of such global learning in our university curriculum. The following video was created by Japanese Studies program student, Devon Miller, who played “Flowers Will Bloom” during the ceremony. The video consists of images of those who participated in the tree planting. Enjoy Devon’s guitar background music, too.

These cutting-edge books bring together scholars, researchers, and practitioners from around the globe to map out and explore emergent disciplines. Explorations often include business and human rights, and the real-world effects of businesses on individuals and communities. With innovative focus on voices of affected individuals and communities from both developed and developing nations. Business and Human Rights - Karen Bravo IU Robert H. McKinney School of Law Dean Karen Bravo, is a well known international law scholar. Her research interests include regional integration, labor liberalization, slavery, and human trafficking. Of late, her research has centered on illicit international markets, with a focus on the human rights implications of the international flow of goods and services (e.g., “wombs for rent,” human organ harvesting, and wildlife trafficking), as well as the parallels of and connections between historic chattel slavery and contemporary human trafficking. Dean Bravo’s collaboration with Professor Jena Martin of West Virginia University College of Law led to their first co-edited volume The Business and Human Rights Landscape: Moving Forward, Looking Back published by Cambridge University Press in 2016. This book was launched at the Palais des Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, as part of the proceedings of the fourth annual United Nations Forum on Business and Human Rights. The book offers an analysis of changes created by the 2011 adoption of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The adoption of these principles marked a watershed moment, establishing the very first global standards addressing the human rights impacts of businesses. In light of this paradigm shift, the volume offers a comprehensive analysis of the current legal framework. It includes in-depth explorations of the UN Guiding Principles from both theoretical and practical standpoints, with case studies ranging from the 2013 Rana Plaza garment factory building collapse in Bangladesh, Conflict Diamonds and corporate social responsibility, and resource extraction and the ‘Resource Curse’ in Kenya. Bookending current analyses are historical accounts of the creation of corporate entities and forward-looking perspectives (analyzing labor's role). Bringing together legal scholars from multiple countries, The Business and Human Rights Landscape is a key resource for academicians, activists, and lay persons tracking the implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, especially SDG 8 on decent work and economic growth, and SDG 12 on responsible consumption and production. Dean Bravo’s most recent co-edited book, When Business Harms Human Rights: Affected Communities that are Dying to be Heard, was published by Anthem Press in 2020. This book uses story-telling techniques to explore the real-world intersection of laws and policies on individuals and communities from around the world, including the United States, and offers an in-depth investigation of business-related human rights impacts and the challenges experienced by victims in addressing remedies. The narratives follow rights holders in their attempts to secure remedies, and examine the impact of the emerging legal regime of business and human rights. Cases include the pursuit of justice for DBCP-Exposed Banana Farmers in the Philippines, violations by Chinese multinational corporations in Zimbabwe, community disruption caused by mining exploration in Colombia, and the heath of veteran coal miners in the United States, among many others. None of the scholarly books currently published within the field of business and human rights have provided narratives from victims or made their perspectives and experiences the center of inquiry and analysis. Both of Dean Bravo’s volumes make a substantial contribution to the UN Agenda 2030 for global transformation, as the world updates its vision on the role of business in sustainable development. Climate Change - Dr. Gabriel Filippelli Climate Change and Resilience in Indiana and Beyond – A book addressing SDGs 2, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17 Co-authored by Dr. Gabriel Filippelli and other experts, Climate Change and Resilience in Indiana and Beyond delves into issues of Climate Change and methods to address these problems. Climate Change is shifting the lifestyle and livelihoods of Hoosiers, while threatening the Indiana environment. These changes can cause significant disruptions to the state’s economy, health and infrastructure. However, despite concerning predictions about future climatic conditions, Indiana has an opportunity to avert these disastrous consequences. The book Climate Change and Resilience in Indiana and Beyond aims to identify avenues of reducing climate impact to stop climate disasters. The culmination of Indiana University's Prepared for Environmental Change Grand Challenge, this collection showcases how scientists, policymakers, communicators, and others are working hard to protect Indiana's economy and way of life by becoming more resilient. Researchers are creating new environmental resilience frameworks, building on years of existing research on how ecosystems can adapt, how social systems process threats in order to change, and how individuals themselves fit into the larger picture. In addition to presenting research results, Climate Change and Resilience in Indiana and Beyond provides clear examples of how Hoosiers can make a difference by reducing risks, lessening the harmful impacts of climate change, and preparing for the unavoidable. Book chapters co-authored by Dr. Filippelli include Climate and Water Systems; Built Environments and Green Infrastructure; and Equitability, Health, and Resilience in the Face of Climate Change. The topics in the book directly address SDGs 2 (Zero Hunger), 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), 10 (Reduced Inequalities), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Infrastructure), 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), 13 (Climate Change), 14 (Life Below Water), 15 (Life on Land), and 17 (Partnerships for the Goals). Climate Change and Life - a book addressing SDGs 13, 14 & 15 Climate Change and Life , by Dr. Gabriel Filippelli (School of Science), targets the critical work of SDG 13 on climate action, SDG 14 on life below water, and SDG 15 on life on land. Over billions of years, the Earth has undergone major shifts in climate and geography, while living organisms have grown and thrived through major extinction events. These major shifts have effectively shaped the world into the planet we know now. Dr. Filippelli analyzes the Earth’s climate history and compares it to the histories of our neighbors Venus and Mars. The parameters studied include atmospheric and orbital conditions of climate, how past climate change is quantified, major evolutionary and extinction events, human evolution and its impact on global climate, future climate expectations, and the fate of global ecosystems. In his conclusion, Dr. Filippelli explores the limits of habitability in the Universe and sets realistic expectations on our world’s climate change.

This section highlights several examples of the ways in which students have engaged internationally in critical analysis and solution building around the SDGs. IUPUI Honors - University of Eswatini Virtual Exchange In Fall 2022, Prof. Ian McIntosh from the IUPUI Honors College co-taught a virtual exchange class with his colleague from the University of Eswatini, Zenzo Ncube. Twenty IUPUI Honors students and twenty students from the University of Eswatini, representing multiple disciplines, were brought together virtually to learn about each other and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (the SDGs). The platform for this connection was a novel new technology called CN or Course Networking (www.theCN.com), a learning management system (LMS) developed at the IUPUI Cyberlab that is ideal for virtual exchange. There were two major dimensions to the class. The first involved the students getting to know each other, with a strong emphasis on culture, identity, and current affairs. The students were paired up, but they also connected with other class members through the Facebook-like Course Networking site. The goal was to make the students feel like they were actually visiting Eswatini or the USA. During the 'get to know you' phase of the class, the students shared amazing things about where they live and what makes their home so special or unique. For Eswatini students, it was the fact that they live in one of the world's few remaining absolute monarchies. Indiana students, by contrast, shared stories about their favorite holidays, like Halloween and Christmas, popular restaurants, and things that they would do together when their partner came for a real visit, such as visiting the world-famous Indianapolis Children's Museum or the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. While this cultural learning was happening, the students were also becoming familiar with the UN's 2030 agenda for global transformation encapsulated in the '5 Ps': People, Planet, Peace, Prosperity, and Partnership. Adopted by all UN member states in 2015, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and associated targets are a call to action for all, both rich and poor, to promote prosperity while protecting the needs of future generations. Universities play a critical role in meeting the SDGs through teaching, interdisciplinary research, the creation of evidence-based knowledge, measuring and evaluation, and advocacy. We need to inculcate this idea of working together to meet the challenge. So, working in cross-country teams, the students were asked how the US and Eswatini were responding to this global call to action. How can the specific disciplines of the students, whether it is business or marketing, or the arts and sciences, be engaged in this struggle? The major assignment for the virtual exchange class was to create a poster where the students summarized their findings to these questions. Some examples of these posters by the students are below. IUPUI Honors - University of Rwanda Virtual Exchange In Fall 2020, Prof. Ian McIntosh from the IUPUI Honors College co-taught a virtual exchange class with his colleague from the University of Rwanda, Michel Ndahimana. Twenty-three IUPUI Honors students from multiple disciplines, and twenty marketing students from the University of Rwanda, were brought together virtually to learn about each other and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (the SDGs). During the 'get to know you' phase of the class, the students shared amazing things about where they live and what makes their home so special or unique. For Rwandan students, it was the modern-day miracle of Rwanda post-genocide. Kigali is now the safest and cleanest capital city on the African continent. Then there were posts on famous tourist attractions like the Gorillas in Volcano National Park or how Rwanda is using walking, talking robots to monitor COVID patients in the larger cities. Indiana students, by contrast, shared stories about their favorite foods, music, movies, and hobbies. Some examples of these posters are below, along with commentary by the students.

The scholarship provides $15,000 to an incoming or current IUPUI student whose family was displaced during the establishment and construction of the IUPUI campus. This newly established financial support program is the ‘Through Their Eyes Memorial Scholarship’. Founded in 1969, IUPUI stands on the historic homelands of Native peoples and a once-vibrant Black residential community. This new scholarship honors the descendants of those displaced ancestors who once called the Ransom Place and Indiana Avenue neighborhoods, where IUPUI campus now stands, home. The name of the scholarship honors the IUPUI Black Student Union 's 2006 Black Student Initiative, which was a catalyst for advancing change toward racial equity and inclusion on the campus. Students who are related to the families displaced by the development of the IUPUI campus and are pursuing their first undergraduate degree at IUPUI will be eligible for the award of up to $15,000, renewable for up to four years. The first recipient of the scholarship, announced on July 21, 2021, was Pike High School graduate Nona Duncan of Indianapolis. Her great-great grandfather had built a house on Minerva Street, which is now where the University Tower is located. The establishment of the Through Their Eyes Scholarship, as well as the simultaneously introduced Center for Africana Studies and Culture in the School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI , are among the goals identified in the IUPUI Action Committee Report detailing anti-racist and racial justice initiatives. Since its formation in 2000, this committee has brought forth several recommendations after identifying where systemic racism in higher education's daily practices and procedures unfairly target populations of color. Instrumental in the push for the establishment of the Through Their Eyes Scholarship was IUPUI historical archeologist Paul Mullins . Along with his colleague Susan Hyatt, Dr. Mullins produced a groundbreaking study titled “Invisible Indianapolis: Race, Heritage, and Community Memory in the Circle City”. This project examines history and material culture in a series of Indianapolis neighborhoods that are currently effaced, ignored, or misrepresented in public discourse. The goal of the project is to use ethnographic interviews and documentary research to illuminate how otherwise “invisible” neighborhoods provide powerful insights into challenging the histories of the class, cultural, religious and racial inequalities that continue to shape our city. It was this area of research that helped to document the oral history of the Ransom Place and Indiana Avenue neighborhoods, which in turn inspired the creation of the Through Their Eyes Scholarship for the descendants of those silenced and displaced during the establishment of IUPUI. Read more about Dr. Mullins’s work on race and racial justice The Through Their Eyes Scholarship is administered through the Olaniyan Scholars program, an undergraduate research program in Africana Studies. In support of the Through Their Eyes scholarship, the Olaniyan Scholars program manages the application process, provides support and mentoring for Through Their Eyes scholars, and coordinates with the Native American and Indigenous Studies program to support Native and Indigenous student mentoring and research experiences and opportunities where appropriate. Within the Center for Africana Studies and Culture, the Olaniyan Scholars program will serve as the conduit for community-engaged undergraduate research. The scholarship is a way to honor the displaced, their ancestors, and their descendants. It is also one of many examples of how IUPUI is engaged in furthering the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals related to lessening inequalities ( SDG 10 – Reducing Inequalities ), inclusive education ( SDG 4 – Education ), and peaceful, inclusive, and just societies ( SDG 16 – Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions ).

The certificate, coordinated by Dr. Pat Fox, addresses seven of the UN Sustainable development Goals: SDG 7-Affordale and Clean Energy; SDG 9-Industry, Innovation and infrastructure; SDG 11-Sustainable Cities and Communities; SDG 13- Climate Action; SDG 14-Life Below Water; and SDG 15- Life on Land; SDG 17 Partnerships for the Goals Sustainable Technologies Certificate Patricia Fox is a Clinical Assistant Professor in the Department of Technology Leadership and Communication in the Purdue School of Engineering and Technology (SET) at IUPUI. Pat has been a member of the faculty in the School for over 37 years and has taught leadership, ethics, staffing, senior research project, and sustainability courses, including the ‘Go Green’ study abroad course about sustainable practices in businesses and industries in Germany and France. In 2021, Pat is serving Co-Chair of the University Faculty Council’s Climate Action Plan Task Force. One of the most significant sustainability initiatives in which Pat has been involved is the creation of a Certificate in Sustainable Technologies. In the United States, sustainability has gained importance in business, industry, government, government agencies, higher education, and in the public consciousness. The goal of meeting today’s needs without harming future generations’ ability to realize their potential is a hallmark of sustainable practices, and there is widespread interest from many disciplines and sectors in developing, enhancing, and integrating sustainability into aspects of products, services, and solutions. Thus, the need to equip students with the knowledge, skills, and perspectives to make contributions to sustainability initiatives has never been greater. Green jobs are rapidly being created as the economy begins embracing sustainable, energy efficiency, and low-carbon practices. The driving forces behind the development of green jobs are businesses wishing to maintain cutting edge technology, become more energy efficient, while lowering their carbon footprint, or becoming entirely carbon neutral. SET’s Certificate in Sustainable Technologies is designed to address a growing need for professionals who can contribute to the green global workforce with knowledge in sustainable practices in current technologies. The Sustainable Technologies Certificate will be beneficial to students who want to acquire knowledge in areas of renewable energies, green building, and sustainable design, and who may want to pursue a career in a sustainable technology. All of the Sustainable Technologies Certificate courses are offered online. The Certificate in Sustainable Technologies addresses seven of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, in particular #7-Affordale and Clean Energy; #9-Industry, Innovation and infrastructure; #11-Sustainable Cities and Communities; #13- Climate Action; #14-Life Below Water; and #15- Life on Land; #17 Partnerships for the Goals. The Sustainable Technologies certificate, which the students can complete in one year, consists of 6 courses for a total of 18 credit hours. Course topics include: Introduction to Sustainable Principles and Practices; Energy Efficiency and Auditing; Renewable Energy Technologies; and Emerging Green Technologies, etc. For more information contact Pat Fox at psfox@iupui.edu .

Since 2005, the Galleries at the Herron School of Art and Design have served as a vibrant site of exploration, participation, and learning. Previous, current, and future planned exhibitions inspire patrons to reflect on historical social wrongs, honor marginalized people and perspectives, and consider our environment and sustainable solutions for the future. In Spring 2021 the Galleries opened three new exhibits that explore race, equality, and decolonization – building on previous gallery programming aimed at promoting public understanding and engagement in the areas of inclusion and equality (SDG 10), peace and social justice (SDG 16), and environmental sustainability (SDG 13, 14, and 15). As Herron Galleries Director and Curator Joseph Mella explains, “art with an informed social consciousness is alive and well at Herron.” This observation is made abundantly clear through the currently exhibited arresting work of Paul S. Briggs. Cell Personae: The Impact of Incarceration on Black Lives represents Briggs' personal response to America's other pandemic – the mass incarceration of Black people. The 25 rectilinear slab-and-coil sculptures featured in the exhibition – each scaled to represent the size of a 6-by-8-foot prison cell – serve as a statement of protest against the startling statistic that Black people account for 40 percent of the US prison population, despite accounting for only 6.5 percent of the total American population. Briggs’ pieces unlock a space for personal and collective reflection and dialogue about this ongoing American tragedy, and illuminate the importance of achieving social inclusion, equality, and social justice (SDGs 10 and 16). Learn more about Cell Personae here . Related to the themes found in Briggs’ exhibition, The Sum of Unity – curated by artist and Herron alumnus Samuel Levi Jones – is a composite exhibition in response to the divisive climate in which we all find ourselves, displaying a collection of protest signs created by 50 Indiana and Chicago-based artists, including Herron students, alumni, faculty, and staff (SDG 16). SHIFT: What Can Museums Change? – an exploratory exhibition presented by the students of the Museum Studies program at the School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI – spotlights four museums that have taken steps toward moving their institutions and the cultures in which they are embedded toward honoring people and perspectives that had been pushed to the margins. The students’ collection asks patrons to consider museums’ positionality, messaging, and the institutions of privilege and power which they can challenge or reinforce. The exhibition also calls on museums to reflect on their historical mistakes and change practices and policies that have historically privileged whiteness and wealth. The project gets to the heart of target two of SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities) – promote universal social, economic, and political inclusion. Learn more and virtually tour these and other exhibitions here . In addition to the SDG-relevant exhibitions found in the Galleries, Herron Professor and Graduate Program Director for Visual Communication Design Youngbok Hong is working on sustainable design. At a recent conference on sustainable design as a common good – benefiting the whole of society –Professor Hong presented a paper on the methodological framework for the common good and its applicability in understanding and achieving sustainable design while working towards the SDGs. This work targets sustainable and inclusive aspects in achieving sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11). Additionally, this as well as the art of Professor of Fine Arts Valerie Eickmeier show Herron’s engagement with topics of sustainable development like climate change (SDG 13), life below water (SDG 14), life on land (SDG 15). Professor Eickmeier’s research and studio practice explores aspects of cartography to relay information about specific locations and environments and how they are impacted by climate change. Currently, the particular focus of this work is on how climate change is melting glaciers and icefields at an unprecedented pace and consequently the sea level is rising globally. Through the creation of paintings, woodcuts, and prints, Professor Eickmeier aims to promote awareness and contribute to the dialogue surrounding environmental responsibility and effects of climate change (SDGs 13, 14, and 15). Learn more about Professor Eickmeier’s art and view a virtual gallery here . Herron's galleries – as well as groundbreaking curriculum – continue to be an innovative educational forum for diverse audiences by providing direct and meaningful encounters with art and artists through a wide range of curatorial projects and programming.

However, SDG 16 is not an isolated objective. In fact, as the International Development Law Organization (IDLO) and other global human rights advocacy organizations have demonstrated, SDG 16 drives the success of other rights and justice-related SDGs. The IU Robert H. McKinney School of Law at IUPUI is a champion of the rule of law and its faculty, students, and live-client learning experiences are advancing access to justice, combating inequalities, and promoting social inclusion by embracing the vision of the 2030 Agenda and reaching the targets of its goals. The rule of law is relevant to all three dimensions of sustainable development: economic, social, and environmental. By providing stable and transparent legal regimes, the rule of law encourages economic development, a target of SDG 1 (No Poverty) and SDG 8 (Decent Work & Economic Growth). By ensuring equal opportunity and equitable access to basic services, the rule of law also promotes social development, a target of SDG 10 (Reduce Inequalities). By strengthening laws to protect the environment and ensure proper management of natural resources, the rule of law ensures environmental sustainability, a target of SDG 13 (Climate Justice), SDG 14 (Life Below Water), and SDG 15 (Life on Land). The IU McKinney School of Law and its faculty not only provide students with the training necessary to practice law, but also work with and support students in efforts to help others while doing so. The School, faculty, and students stress the importance of giving back and working with the people and communities of which they are a part. One way that students and faculty realize this dedication is through the various live-client clinics offered at IU McKinney . These Law School Clinics provide students with tangible counsel-client experience in areas of appellate proceedings, immigration law, civil practice, and re-entry assistance – all areas of the dimensions of the rule of law necessary for rights and justice in sustainable development. Two clinics in particular coincide and complement each other in the areas of rights and justice for previously incarcerated citizens: the Civil Practice Clinic (CPC) and the Re-entry Assistance and Community Help (REACH) Clinic . The CPC and the Legal Expungement Advice Program (LEAP) Directed and facilitated by Clinical Associate Professor Carrie Hagan , the CPC provides legal representation and brief advice and service to low-income clients on a variety of general civil matters, including housing and expungement. Shelter, or housing, is a basic human right, yet access to housing remains a consistent barrier to those existing the carceral or prison system. Through their advocacy and representation work, CPC students are helping citizens find and retain adequate housing as they re-enter the community, a clear indication of the clinic’s important efforts in achieving targets in SDG 1 (No Poverty), SDG 8 (Decent Work & Economic Growth), SDG 10 (Reduce Inequalities), and SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities & Communities). More from the UN SDGs and the targets of adequate shelter, affordable housing, and ending homelessness around the globe can be found here . Professor Hagan and CPC students participating in these live-client experiences also work to advise citizens with criminal records through expungement processes so to help lessen the burdens these individuals face while striving to meet their basic needs after repaying their debt to society. For many, a criminal record becomes a deadweight that hinders an adequate quality of life, making it challenging and, in some cases, nearly impossible to attain housing, employment, and education – factors necessary for the justice, equality, and social inclusion entrenched in the SDGs. To assist in alleviating this affliction, the CPC clinic has partnered with Goodwill of Central and Southern Indiana to create the Legal Expungement Advice Program (LEAP). LEAP is designed to provide resources for citizens to get back on their feet and achieve a better, fulfilling life moving forward. With the help of students and Goodwill staff members, program participants develop paths to success that involve setting career and financial goals, while being offered any necessary services, such as temporary emergency assistance, housing, childcare, and transportation, during the expungement process. The support and services provided though LEAP demonstrate the IU McKinney School of Law and CPC clinic’s dedication to the rule of law found within the dimensions of the SDGs. While the partnership with Goodwill highlights the program’s observation of SDG 17 (Partnerships for Goals), LEAP is realizing the targets of SDG 8 (Decent Work & Economic Growth), SDG 10 (Reduce Inequalities), and SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities & Communities), all while valuing SDG 16 (Peace, Justice, & Strong Institutions) and its regard for the importance of social justice and human rights. Read more about LEAP The Re-Entry Assistance and Community Help (REACH) Clinic Expungement is an option for those re-entering society after they have been charged, convicted, and incarcerated for a crime. Complementing the Law School’s CPC clinic is the Re-Entry Assistance and Community Help (REACH) clinic, which provides mentor advocacy to newly released probationers’ reintegrating into society. Students also offer outreach to the greater Indianapolis community where they provide brief service and advice to their clients in areas of employment, licenses, and additional re-entry-related matters. In line with the principles of SDG 17 (Partnerships for Goals), the mentor advocacy component of this clinic is an innovative collaboration between the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Indiana, the Indiana Federal Community Defenders, the United States Probation Department, Goodwill Industries, Inc., and Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law. Additionally, prior to the severe restrictions imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, REACH students partnered with IUPUI’s Black Law Students Association and community partners to present an annual in-person Re-Entry Job and Resource Fair to provide advice and public service recommendations to citizens recently released from the carceral system. In Spring 2019, the fair hosted nearly 400 students , alumni, and community members. Faculty and staff from the IU McKinney School of Law were on hand to make sure everyone that attended received the assistance they needed. In 2020, the fair reached its fifth consecutive year, providing advice and suggesting services to attendees virtually due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The fair, which hopes to resume in-person as pandemic restrictions ease, is organized by IU McKinney Professor and head of the REACH clinic, Lahny Silva , in partnership with Professor Hagan. Even with the hurdles presented by the global pandemic, the students of the CPC and REACH clinics remain determined to offer the services necessary for community re-entry. Services offered at the fair have included resume reviews, expungement information and advice, driver's license information, child support, help with food assistance, health insurance applications, and voter registration. Similar to the CPC, the REACH clinic inspires progress towards a society that embraces the elements of social justice and human rights found in SDG 16 (Peace, Justice, & Strong Institutions) and throughout the targets of the other 16 goals for global transformation. IU McKinney School of Law: Health and Human Rights Clinic and Seminar Engages in SDGs 3, 16, & 17 Fran Quigley is a clinical professor of law at the IU McKinney School of Law. He is the author of five books and many articles on social justice and human rights themes, including most recently How Human Rights Can Build Haiti: The Lawyers, the Activists, and the Grassroots Movement (2014), If We Can Win Here: The New Front Lines of the Labor Movement (2015), Prescription for the People: An Activist's Guide to Making Medicine Affordable for All (2017) and the forthcoming Religious Socialism: Faith in Action for a Better World (Fall, 2021). He also contributes to the publications of the Religious Socialism working group of the Democratic Socialists of America. Prof. Quigley is the director of the IU McKinney Health and Human Rights Clinic, where students partner with Indiana Legal Services to advocate for the rights of the poor, with a special focus on individual and systemic barriers to accessing healthcare and the social determinants of health. He also teaches a classroom seminar focused on Health and Human Rights. As articulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, health is a fundamental human right and a necessary foundation for the exercise of almost every other human right. Yet enforcing that right is an elusive goal for billions of people across the globe, including many people in our own local community here in Indiana. This course aims to understand the evolving nature of a right to health, and the many challenges posed by efforts to make that right a practical reality. Students review the unequal distribution of goods and assets—in particular healthcare—globally and in our own community, and the social determinants of health. The most recent cohort of students reflected on the class itself, and on their course projects in the light of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: Samantha Mitchell \"Centering a course around the topic of health and human rights allowed me the space to delve deep into a topic that intrigued me. The class fostered a passion that I hope will one day lead me to a seat on Indiana's Maternal Mortality Review Committee.\" The impetus behind my paper on maternal mortality was the death of Dr. Chaniece Wallace, a Black resident physician at Riley Children's Health Hospital who died from postpartum complications two days after giving birth to her daughter. Additionally, as of 2019, Indiana ranks third in the nation for the highest rate of maternal mortality. I began my paper by examining existing Indiana legislation regarding maternal mortality, and then outlined the main contributors to maternal death. Then I looked at the challenges faced by pregnant women in maternity care ‘deserts’ in Indiana and what measures other states have taken to lower their maternal mortality rates. Finally, I discussed how, using other states as a model, Indiana can lower its maternal mortality rate. My policy proposals to lower the maternal mortality rate in Indiana include: A comprehensive federal database utilized by every state to record, analyze, and compare maternal deaths Closing the three-year reporting gap that the Indiana Maternal Mortality Committee is currently operating under by allocating a full-time maternal mortality division within the Indiana State Department of Health, and Addressing the state's maternal care ‘deserts’ through the promotion of tele-health programs to encourage mothers to attend perinatal care visits. Follow the success of other states when modeling our maternal mortality response, in particular the public-private partnerships fostered by California and the Massachusetts. Taylor Webster “Professor Quigley's Health and Human Rights course really opened my eyes to the direct impact I could have on the legal community. I am privileged to be in law school and it is important that we leverage our education and take classes like this to learn how to positively impact our communities. If we do not know about issues, we cannot contribute to the solutions. This class opened my eyes to a plethora of social issues, most of which could be directly impacted through the intervention of a lawyer who integrates themselves in the community and uses the privilege of a legal education to make a difference.” My course topic was segregation in Indianapolis. Black Indianapolis residents have contributed to the vibrancy and deep history of Indianapolis; their contributions, however, have not always been met with appreciation. Historically, and even today, segregation has run rampant through Indianapolis. Segregation is ever-present in housing and schools. Redlining and other mechanisms have rendered the city and its schools even more divided today than in the past. The implementation of I-65 and I-70, which tore through vibrant communities like Ransom Place, helped contribute to the segregation we see today. The highways made ‘white flight’ to suburban areas and counties more accessible. Those privileged and wealthy enough to move to the suburbs were still provided with easy access to their downtown Indianapolis jobs at the expense of marginalized communities and the homes and neighborhoods they cherished. The effects of segregation can be seen widely throughout Indianapolis. Highways and redlining have decimated neighborhoods and lower life expectancy is seen in the areas affected by these policies. Meanwhile, the life expectancy and health of those who live in Hamilton County and surrounding areas not directly impacted by segregationist policies is much better. Without action to address segregation, its root causes, and the implications it has had on the lives of communities of color, but especially Black communities in Indianapolis, its effects will persist and continue to negatively affect the lives and health of Indianapolis residents. Matthew Serf “Being in Professor Quigley’s Health and Human Rights course allowed me to bring light to a topic that I am very passionate about. It also made me cognizant of the potential for change that I hold as a future legal professional. Offering a course such as this in law school provides an opportunity to educate and to be educated on issues that are not as commonly discussed as others but are equally as important.” My class project was on Black mental health. Conversations surrounding the importance of mental health have grown over the past two decades. As this discussion grows, more research regarding the significance of mental health and positive coping mechanisms have emerged. More people are seeking proper treatment, health insurance companies are covering mental health treatment, and society has begun to destigmatize mental health. However, access to these resources and insurance coverages are disproportionately enjoyed by the majority, leaving those who would benefit greatly from it to suffer. While there is not one community that suffers from poor mental health, the centuries of inhumane treatment of Black Americans have impacted the mental health of generations. There is a plethora of reasons that can be attributed to the state of Black mental health, but a large portion are rooted in racism, socio-economic status, and the pressure to persevere. Events such as the Tuskegee Experiments and the mortality rate of Black mothers while giving birth have created distrust in the healthcare system. In the event that a Black person would like to seek to improve their mental health, obstacles in health insurance such as high deductible costs and requirements for coverage stand in the way. This can result in the continued degradation of an individual’s mental health due to financial stress. Additionally, individuals are more likely to seek proper care if the healthcare professional looks like them. However, African Americans make up 5% of psychiatrists and psychologists. Examining the mental health disparages of African Americans gives a different perspective on the larger issue of inequalities in healthcare we face. Although well-known celebrities and societal figures have used their platforms to bring notoriety to Black mental health, the larger issue of healthcare inequality persists. Mollie Golden “In the fall of 2020, I participated in Professor Fran Quigley's innovative Health and Human Rights Seminar. During this course, I was encouraged to write on a topic that was important to me for my final that touched on health and human rights. I am bilingual in English and Spanish, and have spent the past 9 years assisting individuals with limited English proficiency (LEP) navigate the Indianapolis area in various advocacy roles. I have witnessed the extreme barriers that LEP individuals must overcome to access basic services; so I wrote my paper highlighting the difficulties that LEP individuals face in our current healthcare system, and the importance of language access services.” Over 61.6 million individuals in the United States speak a language other than English at home and this number is only going to continue to grow. The U.S. Census has predicted that by 2030, the U.S.'s primary method of population growth will be from international migration. Therefore, this is the smallest the language access issue will ever be, and it is not a small issue now. The current reality is that many LEP patients become branded as \"poor historians\" due to a culture in which LEP patients are not communicated with because calling for an interpreter is perceived as a hassle. Unfortunately, family members, even young children, are often asked to interpret for their family member on the spot. Interpreting is a difficult skill, and the use of unqualified and subjective interpreters leads to more miscommunications. Without effective communication, a patient’s health and wellbeing is at risk every time they step into a doctor’s office. When a patient cannot effectively communicate, they cannot share important information with their physician, or make informed decisions about their health, and as a result grave errors occur. It is possible to prevent these grave errors through the use of competent interpreter services. There needs to be a focus on language access services in the U.S. to ensure that the nation can keep up with the changing demographics. Indiana has an opportunity to lead the nation and should jump at the chance to rebrand ourselves from the Crossroads of America to the Language Hub of America. A place where languages are celebrated and providing access isn't seen as a hassle, but simply just part of communication. One thing Indiana can do is set a standard for health interpreters so that personnel can confidently and competently share information with LEP individuals throughout the state. Institutions like IUPUI should look to build interpreter certification programs that are accessible to a wide range of participants, specifically immigrant participants. By building interpreter certification programs within Indiana, we would help to ensure that all Hoosiers have access to qualified interpreters as well as others throughout the nation. Courtney Oliver “The Nordic countries have been at the forefront of social change in adopting policies to provide for the needs of parents, especially working parents. For Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, the chief means of reconciling work and family life, promoting equality, and ending poverty lie in the institutional support created by legislative action. Hopefully the Scandinavians can show Americans that a welfare system for all citizens is not something that should be feared, safety nets do not mean you don’t work hard, and socialism is not a bad word.” My Health and Human Rights Seminar paper was entitled “Parenthood in The Nordic Countries: How Welfare States Help Parents in Producing the Happiest People in the World and What the U.S. Can Learn from Them”. The Scandinavian, “democratic socialist” countries of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark consistently rank at the top of the list of best countries to live. They are also known as the happiest countries in the world. This is especially true for women and mothers. Raising a family can be difficult and stressful, but the Nordic countries have alleviated most of the financial strains associated with parenting and the cultural stigmas associated with being a working mother. In my paper I discussed the Nordic welfare system, how social support and services like work flexibility, family benefits, childcare provision and other socialist ideals have worked together to mitigate the psychological and financial stresses associated with parenthood. I then compared those countries with the United States and explained how and why we rank so low in both the World Happiness Report and Save the Children Mother’s Index. The U.S. ranks much lower for many reasons including poverty, lack of family benefits, lack of trust in institutions, divorce, and perpetual gender, socioeconomic, and racial inequality. The World Happiness Report and other studies suggest that the secret to Nordic happiness and parenting is the institutional framework of the Nordic welfare state. People tend to be happier in countries where there is easy access to relatively generous welfare benefits, and where the labor market is regulated to avoid employee exploitation. While Scandinavians don’t consider their countries to be democratic socialist in the precise sense of the term, the experience of these nations can serve as an example to other countries (like the U.S.) that want to keep a market system while improving the lives of their populations. While it might not be possible to completely copy the Nordic welfare state systems and implement them here in the United States, their example of how to balance capitalism with social reforms will continue to inspire people all over the world. Confronting Barriers to the Human Right to Housing - Making the World a Better Place with the SDGs Allyson Crane, a student in IUPUI's McKinney School of Law, presented the school's work with SDGs as a part of the 2022 IUPUI International Festival - IUPUI SDG Day.

The school offers degrees from undergraduate to post-doctoral levels. IUSD also has an established International Dentist Program for dentists who received their degree from non-US accredited schools and want to practice in the US. With nine academic departments and approximately 300 faculty members, IUSD is at the forefront of dental health innovation. Since its establishment in 1879, the school has pioneered oral and public health education, contributing to significant public health breakthroughs such as the invention of the first fluoride toothpaste and research in dental informatics. IUSD Office for Global Engagement The IUSD Office for Global Engagement is actively involved in the pursuit of global development through the creation of multidisciplinary opportunities in partnership with global communities in order to meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). From teaching, research, service programs and projects, oral health addresses SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 16, and 17. Pursuing SDG 3: IUSD Curriculum SDG 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being within all age groups. This goal aligns with IUSD’s mission “to advance the oral and systemic health of the people of Indiana and globally through excellence in teaching and learning, research and creative activities, patient care, civic engagement and service.” To fulfill this mission, the school’s behavioral sciences, ethics and professionalism curriculum is taught from a relationship-centered care vantage point, a paradigm for enhancing population health management. Pursuing SDG 6: Research and Collaboration SDG 6: Ensure availability, and sustainable management, of water and sanitation for all. IUSD is actively engaged in addressing this sustainable development goal through various research and advancement initiatives. Key examples include: Loai Hazzazi (Photo 1) is conducting his PhD dissertation on water filtration systems, fluoride in water for caries prevention, and water insecurity in the US and Saudi Arabia. His mentor is Dr. Frank Lippert. Guillermo Tamayo-Cabeza (Photo 2) (supported by Fulbright) is studying exposure to toxicants in water and salt in Mexico. Hisproject, which is NIH funded, will include data on water availability, sanitation, and insecurity. Dr. E. AngelesMartinez Mier is his mentor. Gina Castiblanco (Photo 3), a Post-Doctoral Fellow, is preparing an NIH submission to study the effect of environmental toxicants on bone health in women in Mexico. Her study will also includeissues of sanitation, including toxicants in water. Pursuing SDG 11: Community Engagement and Partnerships SDG 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. In pursuance of this goal, IUSD has forged partnerships with community organizations to foster sustainability in health care. Community engagement is a key domain in IUSD’s strategic plan which aims to enhance IUSD’s impact throughout Indiana, and globally, through excellence in community engagement and interprofessional collaboration that builds on community assets and improves health equity. Promoting Globally Engaged Health Practitioners IUSD’s curriculum focuses on educating students about the social determinants of health in the communities they will serve, their responsibilities for supporting community health initiatives, and their responsibilities for health promotion and disease prevention. Topics included in IUSD courses that align with the SDG goals are: Social determinants of health and oral health inequalities Culture stereotypes, biases and prejudices in clinical care Lifespan and mental health Childhood development and access to care issues Diversity, equity and inclusion Access to care for LGBTQ+ Patients living with HIV Human trafficking IUSD is also embarking in curricular mapping and redesigning to ensure that their students receive instruction and experiences to support the SDGs as dental professionals upon graduation.

Dr. Amanda Cecil is fully engaged in this initiative to corroborate and develop sustainable travel practices. In coordination with GBTA, SHHS faculty promote education, research and resources on corporate travel sustainability practices. This overarching initiative aims to educate travel managers and industry players (including airlines and hospitality companies) while proactively advocating for change in meeting the needs of people, planet, and profit in organizations. GBTA is also making a significant commitment in 2022 to set goals, push emission reductions, and collaborate on actionable sustainability priorities. SHHS is also focusing on understanding and enhancing the effect of the tourism industry on climate change, while enabling the building of sustainable futures after climate disasters. Dr. Becky Liu-Lastres leads this research with the impetus behind this research being the fact that tourism is an effective tool in building economies in developing and developed countries. However, tourism is also associated with the destruction of habitat, over population, and pollution. To use tourism and hospitality in a sustainable fashion requires a solid understanding of the various effects the industry can present on local- and global-scales. Such research on sustainability will ensure that economic growth can be attained without putting local lives and environment at risk. The prevalence of gender equality in the tourism and hospitality sector is another research initiatives at SHHS.  This initiative focuses on the reduction of gender inequality in the tourism industry, studying the constraints preventing women from progressing and attaining leadership opportunities in this sector. With this research, SHHS hopes to develop and help implement effective policies in tourism corporations. Addiction Recovery: SDGs 3, and 17 In collaboration with community partners, an IUPUI SHHS research team is studying occupational health strategies to enable youth addiction recovery. This research has the primary goal of adding to the knowledge of occupation therapy’s distinct contribution to mental health studies, and to reveal ways in which occupational therapists help mitigate the shortage of qualified behavioral health providers in Indiana. Neurological and Behavioral Health: SDGs 3, and 17 Researchers at SHHS are actively engaged in studying the neurological processes involved in rehabilitation, and behavioral health modifications resulting in quicker and more complete recoveries. Primary research is performed in key areas include investigations of biological risk factors for the development of post-traumatic headaches following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Results from this study will enable identification and development of effective preventative strategies and treatment plans among civilian and military populations. Another critical research area is motor skills recovery and neuroplasticity. The initiative uses noninvasive brain stimulation to study the brain plasticity of numerous motor skills. This work has the potential of leading to a deeper understanding of human motor activity, and improvements to motor ability rehabilitation among recovering patients and high-level athletes. Physical Activity and Wellness: SDGs 3, and 17 Physical Activity and Wellness is an important area of research at SHHS. Researchers study the mechanisms of physical activity which benefit healthy people and those with orthopedic and neurological disorders. Pain management and reduction is also a principal area of study, with researchers investigating relationships between mobility and pain reduction, and the effect that interprofessional education has on reducing opioid prescriptions. Run in partnership with the IU Health Family Medicine Clinic, SHHS aims to minimize opioid usage while increasing quality of life for participants. Another significant initiative is the “Healthy Me fitness outcomes” study, where the feasibility of fitness measures implementation into a clinic-based lifestyle is assessed among adults 18 years + in Indianapolis. Models of Teaching and Learning: SDGs 4, 10, 16, and 17 SHHS is expanding the integrated case-based learning model to promote clinical readiness using videos and interactive media. The research prepares students to be critical thinkers and problem solvers in a versatile and global healthcare setting. Additionally, SHHS is constantly working towards improving the curriculum to ensure that students are prepared for the world they will work in tomorrow. Current curricular additions that are being considered include the impact of integrated clinical education on acute care confidence in entry-level physical therapy students, the potential to develop student confidence in critical-care environments through high-fidelity simulation, and the development if clinical decision making using a case rounds seminar course. Nutrition Virtual Exchange Faculty members are encouraged to pursue the SDGs in their lectures and student interactions. A virtual summer exchange program, led by Dr. Lamia Scherzinger, with a focus on nutrition studies has been able to incorporate SDGs into the syllabus. Students are given the option to work as pairs and choose between SDGS 2, 3, 6, and 14, and are tasked with the challenge of coming up with novel solutions within the chosen SDG. On an individual level, faculty have also attended the Online Learning Consortium’s Institute for Emerging Leadership in Online Learning where all 17 SDGs are discussed. Afterwards, each participant selects one SDG and creates a unique artifact addressing it in the world of Online Education. Such experiences enhance and expose SHHS to novel method and ideas to implement in their contributions to a sustainable future.

Her goal is to understand the limitations and strengths of information and communication technologies to foster or inhibit social change. The themes of power, empowerment, politics, ethics, values, advocacy, and social justice within the context of the design and use of socio-technical systems, are center stage. For example, innovations in collaborative work information systems can keep track of employees and contractors in domains such as ride-sharing. Drivers login to begin a work session, and computers keep track of their cars, customers, and ride locations. Such systems enable accurate payments to drivers and create work histories that are shared among managers, drivers, and clients. In other work domains, such as home care, delivery, farm work, and child care, transparent collaborative information systems do not exist, leaving work environments open to inaccurate compensation, conflict over work requirements or behavior, or even exploitation. Prof. Dombrowski’s research, which is funded by the National Science Foundation , Intel Science & Technology Center for Social Computing , The Newkirk Center For Science and Society , and UCI’s Graduate Division Public Impact Fellowship Program , examines the needs of workers, employers, and managers for collaborative and shared reporting, and opportunities for innovative technology to create such systems. Prof. Dombrowski’s research has also explored how to design for low-wage workers, how blue-collar work is becoming data-driven and, with PhD student Nitya Verma, the challenges police face with data-driven approaches . Current projects include: Designing Social Computing Tools for Wage Theft How to design computing tools to help low-wage workers deal with a problem called wage theft, which is any illegal conduct by an employer or manager that denies benefits or wages. How are computing-aided automations changing low-wage service work? Computerization is changing different kinds of work, and the impact on lower-waged occupations is little understood. Prof. Dombrowski is conducting interviews with low-wage service work stakeholders to identify current trends and challenges related to how new computing tools will impact their work. Social computing systems and domestic violence With her PhD student, Hawra Rabaan, Prof. Dombrowski’s is looking at how to design social computing tools to better support Muslim domestic violence survivors in the U.S. Lowering Barriers for the Blind: Davide Bolchini SDG 4: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all SDG 16: Promote just, peaceful and inclusive societies SDG 17 Building Strong Partnerships There are over 7 million blind people in the United States and Davide Bolchini, who chairs the IUPUI School of Informatics and Computing Department of Human-Centered Computing , is actively exploring novel solutions that could make surfing the Web easier for them both on mobile and laptop devices. “The blind user experience with the web is still very far from enjoyable”, says Dr. Bolchini. “There is so much more that we can do to make it, not just slightly better, but considerably more natural and desirable. Together with our stellar graduate students, we will explore strategies to help blind users understand where they are on a complex website, where they can go next from a page, or what to do to know more about a topic. This can make a significant difference in daily web navigation tasks”. Bolchini has received a major grant from the National Science Foundation’s Cyber-Human System program and a Google Faculty Research award to explore the use of wearable and sound-based technologies to increase web-accessibility for people who are blind or visually impaired. Building on over a decade of research to understand how people who are blind may aurally navigate the web, Bolchini says that we take for granted that visual displays are the only medium for experiencing information-rich, interactive applications. But he says that this paradigm is very limiting. “Typing… is an activity that relies upon on-screen keyboards that still display characters visually. This presents a barrier for people who are blind.” Example of a non-visual keyboard: a wearable device that tracks hand gestures and converts them into text combinations Bolchini’s research investigates how to free ourselves from screens and keypads. “A major unsolved challenge is how to manipulate text aurally and silently, in situations when voice input fails or breaks privacy boundaries,” he says. “This will allow us to unbind users from a visual display.” When people who are blind or visually impaired navigate the mobile web, for example, they have to hold a phone in their hands at all times. Such continuous, two-handed interaction on a small screen hampers the user's ability to keep hands free to control aiding devices (e.g., cane) or touch objects nearby, especially on-the-go. It also increases the chances for their device to fall or be stolen. Community partnership is an important part of human-centered computing research. Bolchini’s research engages people who are blind and visually impaired from the Indiana School for the Blind , Bosma Enterprises , and Easterseals Crossroads as well as IU students from underrepresented groups. Bolchini’s work build upon the research on ‘aural informatics’ by professor Steve Mannheimer and Dr. Mathew Palakal in the Human-Centered Computing Department, which already counts a prior Google Research Award and two NSF-funded projects on web accessibility, non-speech sounds, and aural navigation. Listen to Prof. Bochini speak about his research in this 8 minute YouTube video This research is based on work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant IIS #1909845.

Collaboratively designed and implemented virtual exchanges provide a rich educational environment for students, faculty, and staff. Students can connect with counterparts synchronously or asynchronously. It can be developed as a module in a course or used as the pedagogical approach for an entire course. Virtual Exchange in Action The Office of International Affairs has been supporting the implementation of technology-enhanced global learning for more than two decades, and in Spring 2020, we profiled three new IUPUI virtual exchanges, each with its own unique characteristics. Read about real examples Virtual exchange as a strategy for curriculum internationalization Virtual exchange can facilitate comparative and interdisciplinary learning across cultural contexts, intercultural learning, and global problem solving. Faculty can develop a virtual exchange to serve as the primary way to incorporate a global perspective into a course or it can be used to complement another internationalization strategy such as study abroad or service learning. Virtual exchange in the co-curriculum Student Affairs professionals can also employ virtual exchange to facilitate learning between students and groups around the world. For example, similar student groups, whether it be student government organizations, cultural groups, or leadership programs, can engage in a collaborative virtual exchange in order to address shared interests. Student benefits Through virtual exchange students can gain knowledge and skills in a variety of areas important to their personal, academic, and professional development, including intercultural communication, critical thinking, foreign language, cross-cultural teamwork, and problem-solving skills. Virtual exchange can also motivate student participation in study abroad or other types of internationalized learning experiences. Faculty benefits Faculty benefits include enhancing their scope of disciplinary knowledge, widening their professional network, cultivating research collaborators, and enhancing their own personal development through intercultural and international interaction . Connect with a Partner Institution Are you ready to include virtual exchange, but don't have an international contact?  OIA can help by connecting you to IU's Global Connections through the Office of the Vice President for International Affairs. Find a Global Connection Technology to facilitate virtual exchange Faculty and students can use a variety of free online tools to develop and implement a Virtual Exchange. Social media platforms are also useful, student-friendly tools to facilitate asynchronous collaboration that happens outside of class time and for individual analysis and reflection. Faculty can choose to be an active participant in a group platform, using it to develop community between partner classes and to prompt, monitor and evaluate student engagement, or they can request that students engage one-on-one with counterparts on their own schedules. Whatever the approach, it’s important to use tools that are equally accessible for the classes. Here are some commonly used tools: Google Hangouts Skype Slack WhatsApp Zoom CourseNetworking - The CN IUPUI Virtual Exchange Community of Practice (VECoP) The Office of International Affairs and the Institute of Engaged Learning are establishing a community of practice to support faculty in learning about, implementing, and enhancing virtual exchange. For more information, contact VECoP Chair Lamia Scherzinger , Senior Lecturer, School of Health and Human Sciences. NextGen Coders Network IUPUI is also participating in the NextGen Coders Network (NGCN), a free, non-credit virtual exchange offered by the Stevens Initiative and implemented by World Learning that brings together university students and young professionals to create solutions to their countries' greatest challenges using code. No experience with coding is necessary. For more information, see Corinne Renguette , Associate Professor, School of Engineering & Technology. For more information You may contact Leslie Bozeman , Director of Curriculum Internationalization, to discuss implementing a virtual exchange and inquire about professional development opportunities.

We have designed a financial assistance program to specifically address situations where your funding was severe and negatively impacted by a situation that was unpredictable and beyond your control . Students with no change in funding or situation are not considered for this award. We accept applications in the fall and spring semesters. Applications for the current academic must be submitted by 11:59pm on the following dates: Sunday, October 15 (Fall 2023 applications) Sunday, March 10 (Spring 2024 applications) Please read all the information below before submitting your application. Eligibility Requirements If you are an IUPUI graduate or undergraduate student from abroad on an F-1 or J-1 visa, you may apply for grant or loan assistance if you meet the following requirements: Must have completed at least two semesters of full-time coursework at IUPUI at the time the award begins. (Exceptions to this requirement may be considered in the case of loan applications when the situation is particularly severe). Be able to document an extenuating financial circumstance leading to a financial hardship with insufficient sources of financial support. This need must have developed after starting the academic program. (In other words, applicants must have had sufficient funding when starting the program, as was demonstrated on the financial documents.) Be currently enrolled in a degree program and have at least a 2.75 (undergraduate) or 3.2 (graduate) GPA. (Please note that we are unable to consider students in certificate programs at this time.) Must be maintaining legal F-1 or J-1 student visa status. Must be enrolled at least half-time during the semester for which assistance is requested. Learn more about full-time and half-time enrollment for F-1 students. Must be assessed tuition at the non-resident rate. How am I selected for an award? Preference is given to students who meet the following selection criteria: Priority of applications is assigned in the following order: undergraduate students (juniors and seniors above all), master's level students, PhD and Professional level students (MD, JD, DDS). The minimum GPA requirements are listed above, but priority is given to students who have earned a GPA of 3.0 (undergraduate) and 3.5 (graduate) or higher. Students nearing the end of their program are given higher priority than those near the beginning. These criteria will be used to make a decision on your application and type of award available (grant or loan). The committee will review your academic records and financial history and may consult with your Academic Advisor. This committee will make the final award and loan decisions. Once a decision has been made, you will be notified whether or not you have received a financial award. How Much Will I Be Awarded? The amount of the award varies according to the financial need of the student. We try to meet the needs of individual students while providing assistance to as many as possible. As there are often many applicants, we are unable to meet the needs of all students. No single award or loan is intended to cover the total living or tuition costs of a student, nor are the funds available to support needs of dependents. Grant awards can only be applied to bursar balances, and cannot be used for a cash refund. Loans are applied to the student account, but a refund may be issued if the account balance is at $0. Usually awards or loans range from $1,000 to $3,000 USD. Applicants are encouraged to consider this award or loan along with other ways to meet their needs. Applicants are allowed to apply during more than one semester, regardless of whether an award or loan was previously granted. How Do I Apply? Complete the \"International Student Financial Assistance Program\" application in Atlas (available under the “Insurance and Finances” menu) and attach supporting documents of your financial situation. Documentation should include a letter from your sponsor(s) explaining their current financial situation with a realistic picture of their ability to continue funding. Specific dollar amounts should be included. You can also attach any other documentation that supports your case. (Ex. Bank statements, Newspaper articles, Employment termination letters, etc.) We highly recommend that supporting documents be provided. Without documentation, an application is considered weak. Make sure you have your academic advisor's name and email address, as you will need to provide both as part of the application. You will also be asked to complete a budget form. You will need to download the Excel file from the iStart eForm, complete the budget, save as a PDF, and upload a completed budget in PDF form. Atlas will not accept an Excel upload. Submit complete application no later than the deadlines listed above. The International Student Financial Assistance Program application is only available in Atlas during the open application periods. Late applications will not be accepted.

What are Student Loans? Depending on your situation, a student loan may be your best option to help pay for your education. A student loan is money you borrow that you are legally obligated to repay later, usually with interest. A loan enables you to invest in your future by helping you finance a degree that will likely lead to a higher earning potential, which will enable you to pay back the loan. What Types of Loans Am I Eligible For? As an international student you are not eligible for U.S. federal loans or work study. However, you do have several other options. Loans From Your Home Country Find out if you are eligible to take out a loan in your home country. Contact your federal government or education advisor in your country to learn your options. Always carefully consider the terms and potential consequences of a loan before you borrow. Before signing a loan, look into other funding sources, such as scholarships and fellowships. Never borrow money you do not believe you can pay back. Private Loans Consider taking out a private loan in the United States. You will most likely be eligible to borrow from some lenders; however you will most likely need to find a co-signer who is a U.S. citizen. What is a Private Loan? A private loan is a student loan from a private lender to support your education. These are granted by non-IUPUI affiliated lending institutions. Before you apply for a private loan, consider if you are eligible for a loan in your home country. How Does a Private Loan Work? You will borrow a private loan in your name, but because a loan approval depends on a credit check, you will probably need to find a U.S. citizen or permanent resident to co-sign the loan with you. Do your research! The terms, conditions, and eligibility requirements vary widely for private loans, so it is important for you to carefully consider the full financial implications before you borrow. How Do I Find a Private Lender? You have the right to select the private lender of your choice. Neither IUPUI nor the Office of International Affairs is liable for the services provided by the lender you select. The Office of Student Financial Services on campus has created a resource for students seeking Private Loan options. Learn more» Are you dealing with a severe economic hardship?

Several credit unions and banks are located on or near the IUPUI campus. The Indy Chamber has compiled a list of local banks, many of which have multiple locations. Find a bank » All financial institutions offer similar services, with slight differences. Take the time to learn about the services and fees offered before choosing a bank or credit union. Be careful to select the account that best meets your financial needs. Opening an account is like entering into a contract. Be sure to read everything and ask questions if anything is not clear to you. How Do I Get a Bank Account? Before you go to a bank, you should be aware of the requirements you will need to satisfy to open an account. Customer Identification Programs In an effort to prevent fraud like money laundering, U.S. financial institutions are required to verify the identity of every person who opens a bank account. Banks must obtain the following information from you before allowing you to open an account: Your name Your date of birth Your street address—you cannot use a P.O. Box An identification number—you may provide one of the following: A Social Security number (SSN)— Get an SSN » A passport number and country of issuance An alien identification card number A number and country of issuance of any other government-issued document proving nationality or residence and bearing a photograph or similar safeguard Each bank has its own customer identification programs and may ask for documentation in addition to what is described above.

Reference this glossary when you encounter a term you do not understand. Go to the glossary » If I applied for an SSN, do I need to wait until I receive it to open a bank account? If you have already applied for the Social Security number before you try to open a bank account, you should take a copy of the receipt notice with you.

You must have a valid driver’s license to drive in the U.S. There are two kinds of licenses you can use. You can drive legally in the U.S. for one year using a driver's license from your home country and an International Driver's Permit (IDP). An Indiana driver’s license is recommended if you will be in the U.S. more than 6 months, or if you will purchase a car. You must get your International Driver's License in your home country before you arrive in the United States. The United States does not issue IDPs to nonresidents. Getting an Indiana Driver's License Get your learner's permit first If you do not have a driver's license in your home country, the first step to getting an Indiana driver's license is to obtain a learner's permit. A learner's permit allows you to practice driving under the supervision of a licensed driver so that you can learn the rules of the road well enough to pass the tests required to obtain your driver's license. The Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) has more information about getting and using a learner's permit. How to get a driver's license Learn about getting a driver's license » Find the closest BMV location » Tips to Help with the License Process The BMV often is very busy. Plan to spend 2-3 hours there. The BMV has recommended the Indy West Branch at 10 S. Mickley Ave, 46241, and the Madison Ave Branch at 1400 Madison Ave, 46241. These locations are best equipped to handle the special needs of international student and scholar documents. Branch offices are closed on Sundays and Mondays. Some are also closed other days—check before you go. The busiest times at the BMV are Tuesdays, the 15th day of the month, and the 30th day of the month. If possible, avoid going on these days. You will need to provide the car used to take the road test. Be sure that the car is insured and that all of the lights function properly. If you are accompanied by a spouse who also needs to obtain a driver’s license, be sure to arrange for your spouse’s name to be listed on your bank account or utility agreement so that you can obtain an appropriate document to facilitate your spouse’s license application. Whenever you go to the BMV be sure to take note of the names of the individuals who assist you, as well as the date and time of your visit. You may need this information if there are any complications with your application. OIA has no control over the process you must go through to apply for a license, nor the length of time it takes. However, if you receive a letter indicating that you have been denied a license, please bring it to our office. If it appears the denial was an error, we will try to help you get it corrected. Can I get a Driver’s License without a Social Security Number? Yes! In the case that you not have an SSN, you will need to show a letter from the Social Security Administration (SSA) that documents your ineligibility for an SSN. You can obtain the letter from your local SSA office . Find out more about SSNs » Buying a Car in the U.S. New cars are a big investment, so do your research before making the purchase. This will help you determine what a fair price is for a car in today's marketplace. To buy a new car, you will need to go to a car dealership. Tips for Buying a New Car Before visiting a dealership determine how much money you can afford to spend. Stick to your budget and shop around, many dealerships carry identical models. Do not let dealers and salespeople impair your ability to make a rational decision. In Indiana, car dealerships are not allowed to sell cars on Sundays, so this is a good day to look at cars without being pressured to immediately make a purchase. After deciding on a particular model, consult the following resources to help you determine a fair price: \"New Car Buyer's Guide,\" available at drug stores and bookstores. This guide contains the \"list\" price and \"dealer cost\" on base models. If you are looking at an upscale model, the publication also lists the dealer cost on factory-installed options (air conditioning, power steering, etc.). Kelley Blue Book, available in print or online. This allows you to calculate and add taxes to the \"list\" price, along with a reasonable dealer profit ($200 to $500). Visit the Kelley Blue Book » The Car Talk website, which offers advice on buying a car, car insurance, and car maintenance. Visit Car Talk » Buying a Used Car Buying a used car is generally more affordable than buying a new car. However, you have to be careful to make sure the car you buy is in good condition. If you are in the market for a used car, you can buy either from a car dealership or a private seller. Tips for Buying a Used Car Before visiting a dealership or talking to a private seller about purchasing a car, determine how much money you can afford to spend. You can find most dealers online. Private sellers place advertisements in the classified sections of newspapers and special interest papers such as the “Trader” or “Wheels and Deals.” Many sellers also advertise their cars on the classifieds website Craigslist. Visit Craigslist » Note the condition of the car and the asking price, and consult these resources to help you determine if that is a fair price: Kelley Blue Book, available in print or online.

Visit Car Talk » Always drive the car before buying. Check for oil leaks, chassis damage, brake wear, transmission problems, window damage, and door problems. Once you are satisfied with a car, take it to a mechanic for a diagnostic check. This will cost money but is worth the price. Keeping it Legal After purchasing a car you need to take certain steps to make sure your car is legally registered and insured. Insurance Car owners in the U.S. are required by law to carry a minimum level of automobile liability insurance coverage, which will pay up to a certain amount if you are involved in an accident. Liability insurance covers the expenses of the other driver(s) if you cause the accident. Collision insurance covers your own costs if you have a one-car accident. Additional coverage options are available; in general, the greater the value of your car, the more comprehensive insurance coverage you should have. Insurance coverage rates can vary significantly, so be sure to shop around for the best rate for you. You can receive quotes online from most insurance companies.  If you hold a non-U.S. driver’s license, be sure to mention that if you call for a quote. The payments may be higher than they would be with a U.S. license. Registration & Title You will need a license plate for your car to prove that you have registered it with the state. It is against the law to not register your car. If you have a permanent driver's license and buy your car from a car dealer, the car dealer will give you a temporary license plate. That plate is good for a maximum of 30 days. You must register the car to get a new plate before the 30-day period expires. If you do not receive a temporary license plate, you should take the car to be registered as soon as possible. To register your car, bring the following with you to the BMV: Bill of sale: The receipt that the seller gives you when you pay for the car Title and registration card: Proof of ownership of the car that you will get from the seller. If you have financed the car through a bank, the title to the car will go to the lending institution, not to you. However, you will have a registration card. Proof of automobile insurance: A letter or insurance card that you receive from your insurance provider Social Security card: If you do not have a social security card, take all your immigration documents, including your passport and I-94. You will have to pay a fee, based on the price you paid for your car and the model and year of the car. The fee can range anywhere from $26 to $1,000 or more. Other Important Information about Driving in the U.S. Indiana law requires that you have your license, car registration, and proof of car insurance with you at all times when driving. If you are ever pulled over by a police officer, stay in the car with both hands on the steering wheel until the officer comes to your window. If you get out of the car, the officer may assume that you intend to attack and may draw his or her gun. Once the officer arrives you can retrieve the vehicle documents for inspection. Do NOT attempt to bribe the officer—they won’t like it! U.S. laws are very strict about driving after consuming any alcohol. The best plan is to choose a designated driver if you plan to go out in a group. If you are found guilty of driving while drunk you can face jail time, heavy fines, loss of license, and in extreme cases, removal from the country. If you are arrested for drunk driving, you could have your visa revoked without warning. Be especially careful around school buses or in school zones. Fines for speeding or passing a stopped bus can be very high. Be aware that driving at really high speeds can sometimes result in an arrest, which may influence your ability to get future visas. Even when it is late at night and the roads are empty, you should still drive safely and within the speed limit.

This law requires all persons filing resident tax returns in the U.S. to demonstrate that they have a particular level of health insurance coverage called “minimum essential coverage.” If you are in F-1 or J-1 student status and have lived in the U.S. for more than 5 calendar years and made income in the last tax year, you will file a resident tax return. On the resident tax forms you will be required to answer a question as to whether you and your family members had health insurance that met the minimum essential coverage requirements. Most students are non-residents for tax purposes and do not have to attest to their health insurance coverage while completing a federal tax return. What happens if I am required to have an ACA Compliant plan and don’t? You may be required to pay a penalty called a \"shared responsibility payment.\" For more information, you can review the information on the IRS website . I am covered under the International Student Plan Great! The IU International Student Plan is ACA compliant. Aetna will be sending you a form 1095 which gives information about your insurance coverage and period of coverage. You may need this form if you will file a resident tax return for 2015.

Aetna will be sending you a form 1095 which gives information about your insurance coverage and period of coverage. You may need this form if you will file a resident tax return for 2015. I am covered by a different health insurance plan You will need to check with your insurer to find out if your plan is ACA compliant and whether you will receive a form 1095. OIA does not evaluate health insurance plans on the basis of ACA compliance, rather we review health insurance for compliance with immigration regulations pertaining to F-1 and J-1 students.

If you do not understand your health insurance documents, contact your insurance provider for further assistance. Important Insurance Terms You Should Know Claim A request to be paid by a health plan for health services given. An example would be the claim your doctor sends to your health plan after an office visit. Coinsurance The amount you are required to pay for medical care after you have met your deductible. The coinsurance rate is usually expressed as a percentage. For example, if the coinsurance is 20%, then you pay 20% of the medical bill and your insurance company pays 80%. Copay A flat fee you must pay every time you receive a medical service (for example, $15 for every visit to the doctor). The insurance company pays the rest after you pay the deductible. Deductible The amount of money you must pay each year to cover your medical care expenses before your insurance policy starts paying. Low deductible plans are more expensive and high deductible plans are cheaper. Exclusions Specific conditions or services your health plan will not cover. It is extremely important to read the exclusions of an insurance plan before purchasing it. Inpatient Service provided after you are admitted to the hospital. Inpatient stays are those lasting 24 hours or longer (at least one night). Maternity Care Services that generally include prenatal care, normal childbirth/delivery services, and routine newborn nursery care. Network The select doctors, clinics, hospitals, and other medical providers your insurance company contracts with to provide health care to its members at negotiated rates. Out-of-Pocket Maximum The maximum amount you will be required to pay each year for deductibles and coinsurance. This is a stated dollar amount set by the insurance company, in addition to regular premiums. Outpatient Service provided at a hospital, physician's office, or other health facility without you being admitted overnight to the facility. The term \"ambulatory\" is often used to describe outpatient care. Preexisting condition A health problem that existed before the date your insurance became effective. Preferred Provider A doctor who is referred by your insurance company. (Sometimes called a “network provider”.) When you use the doctors and hospitals that are preferred providers, a larger part of your medical bills are covered. You can use other doctors, but at a higher cost. Primary Care Doctor Usually your first contact for health care, this is often a family physician, although some women use their gynecologist. A primary care doctor monitors your health and diagnoses, treats minor health problems, and refers you to specialists if you need another level of care. Provider Any person (doctor, nurse, dentist) or institution (hospital or clinic) that provides medical care. Urgent care Services received for an unexpected illness or injury that is not life threatening but requires immediate outpatient medical care and cannot be postponed. An urgent situation requires prompt medical attention to avoid complications, unnecessary suffering, or severe pain. Usual, customary and reasonable The amount charged or the amount determined to be the reasonable charge, whichever is less, for a particular covered service in the geographical area where it is performed. Who do I contact if I need help understanding my insurance? If you have purchased an IU insurance plan, then you can contact the IU Health Insurance Representatives at studenhc@iu.edu or 812-856-4650. They are located on the Bloomington Campus, but can come to Indianapolis if you schedule an appointment requesting meeting at IUPUI.

Learn more about the health insurance program and benefits offered by IUPUI for international scholars. Employee Benefits (for scholars with full-time employment) All H-1B employees and paid J-1 employees at IUPUI have health insurance available through their employee benefit package. Please see eligibility guidelines for further information. Within the first three weeks of hire, employees with employee benefits will receive employee benefits information from Human Resources. Employees must enroll all accompanying dependents in the employee insurance program within 30 days of the start of employment. If your dependents do not initially accompany you to the U.S., you can enroll them when they arrive; however, you must do so within 30 days of their arrival. Arrival from abroad is considered a Life Event Change and allows you to add your dependents to your plan.  Contact Human Resources through their website for additional information. Other IRS-defined Life Event Changes are: marriage, divorce, birth of a child, or loss of coverage under the spouse's health plan. Changes to your insurance plan must be made within 30 days of the date of the Life Event Change. Unless you have a Life Event Change, all employees are permitted to change insurance plans and add/remove dependents only once per year during the \"Open Enrollment\" period. This deadline occurs in November but policy changes go into effect the following January. Please note that this is the only period in which you can make adjustments to your insurance program once you are enrolled. You should receive information about this from University Human Resources Administration. Further information on the employee benefits plans is available through the IUPUI Human Resources Office . Required Supplemental Health Insurance for J-1 Employees with IU Employee Health Insurance Benefits All J-1 scholars are required by the U.S. Department of State to have medical evacuation/repatriation benefits, which is not included in the IU employee health insurance program. If you are in J-1 status and receive employee benefits, you will need to enroll in the Academic Emergency Services (AES) in order to comply with the medical evacuation/repatriation benefits requirement for J-1 exchange visitors. You may also insure your legal spouse/registered domestic partner and unmarried dependent children (under age 19, or under age 25 if full-time students). You are able to access the Academic Emergency Services online enrollment form following these steps: Go to the IU University Health Plans (UHP) website On the left-hand side menu scroll down to Worldwide Travel Assistance Click on the link and select Academic Emergency Services Enrollment Link from the pop-up menu. Please note that this coverage is a required, separate supplement to IU employee benefits health insurance. It will cost you about $100/year. International Student/Scholar Health Insurance Program (for visiting scholars) If you are a visiting international scholar without health insurance, IUPUI offers a health insurance plan designed for you and your dependents called the IU International Plan . The IU International Plan for the 2023-24 academic year is administered by Anthem. Scholars who need to enroll in the 2023-24 IU International Plan are able to access the online enrollment forms on the Anthem Visiting Scholar Enrollment website. The enrollment year begins August 01 and ends the following year July 31. Therefore, regardless of length of stay, a visiting scholar can initially enroll only through the end of the current academic year (July 31). New enrollment forms become available each year in July. Daily rates for coverage are listed on the enrollment form, so payment can be pro-rated to exactly match the length of your stay. Enrollment Scholars can enroll directly with the insurance provider online. You are eligible for the health insurance benefits even if you do not have the actual insurance card, as soon as your enrollment form is received by the insurance provider. If you need to seek medical assistance once enrolled, but before you can access your insurance card on the Sydney app , contact the insurance provider Anthem to confirm that you have been enrolled. Dependents If your dependents arrive later than you in the U.S., you can enroll them in IU International Plan within 30 days of their arrival. Please contact OIA for assistance to enroll your dependents. Seeking Medical Care Your international scholar insurance plan includes a $500 USD deductible. This means that the first $500 USD of your medical care each year (in addition to your premium payment) is paid by you. After your deductible has been met, your insurance plan will pay all covered medical costs. Please read the brochure carefully to understand the services that the plan covers. Remember, no insurance plan covers 100% of all medical costs. In addition to the deductible, the plan requires that you pay a $15 USD copay for each doctor's office visit. The plan waives the $500 USD deductible and $15 USD copay for treatment you obtain at the Student Health Service (SHS) , located on the first floor of Coleman Hall (beside Ball Residence Hall). The SHS provides basic non-emergency medical services; you may schedule an appointment by calling 274-8214. Services received at the Student Health Center will be paid upfront by the patient at the time of treatment. However, you may then submit your bill to your insurance provider for reimbursement. If you need to seek medical treatment outside of the Student Health Service, it is recommended that you seek a doctor within your insurance network. The insurance program uses a \"Preferred Providers Network.\" When you visit a physician that is part of the network, better rates for medical services have been negotiated by your health insurance provider. If you use a physician or hospital outside of the network, Anthem will cover 40% for eligible out-of-network provider costs. The IU International Plan insurance network is extensive and includes all hospitals and clinics within the IU Medical Center and Clarian Hospital networks, including University Hospital, Riley Hospital for Children; Eskenazi Hospital, Methodist Hospital of Indiana, and Methodist Medical Plazas located in various parts of the city. In addition, it includes the Community Hospitals. You can verify whether a physician is a preferred provider by accessing your IU International Plan resources .

You will also receive an email a few days after you are enrolled from Anthem to be sure you get connected with their online resources. No matter when you are enrolled for the semester, your dates of insurance coverage will match those listed on the IU Student Insurance website for the current semester. Your eligible medical expenses will be covered for those dates, even if you have not yet received a copy of your insurance card. What if I need to go to the doctor before I have my insurance card? If you are just getting enrolled in IU International insurance coverage and need to visit a doctor or pharmacy urgently, it is best to request expedited insurance enrollment (takes 1-2 days) by contacting iadvisor@iupui.edu. You will be provided with a coverage letter that serves as proof of insurnace until your digital Anthem insurance card becomes available. Another option is to pay out of pocket for your visit to the doctor or pharmacy and submit a claim to Anthem once your insurance enrollment has been activated in order to be reimbursed for the amount of the bill covered by insurance. I am a graduate student with an Assistantship or Fellowship. What action do I need to take for insurance enrollment? As a graduate student with a qualifying IUPUI assistantship or fellowship, you are eligible for two different IU health insurance plans and may be enrolled in both. Learn more about the IU Graduate Appointee and IU Fellowship Recipient insurance plans here .  You can decide which insurance plan best meets your needs. You may be enrolled in both insurance plans, depending on when your assistantship or fellowship is confirmed by your department in IU's human resources system. In this the case, you must select which insurance plan you want to keep and take the following actions in order to avoid being billed for two insurance policies: If you want to enroll in the IU International insurance plan, complete the Enroll in IU International Insurance e-form in Atlas, and then complete the IU Graduate Appointees & Fellowship Recipient Waiver Request in order to opt (waive) out of the IU insurance coverage that your department has offered to provide. Failing to complete the waiver request will result in being billed for both insurance policies. If you want to enroll in the IU insurance coverage provided by your department, you must complete a Health Insurance Exemption Request eform in the \"Insurance and Finances\" section in Atlas.  If approved, you will not be enrolled in or billed for IU International insurance coverage for the semester. Some international graduate students prefer to enroll in the IU International Plan because they want to add dependent family member(s) and find this option to be more affordable. Students with graduate assistantships (\"student academic appointments\") must have a Social Security Number on file with IUPUI in order to be eligible for IU Graduate Appointee insurance enrollment. I recently graduated. When will my insurance end? Your insurance coverage will expire at the end of the period of insurance coverage in which you were last registered for classes. The last day of coverage for Spring/Summer insurance is July 31, and the last day of fall insurance coverage is December 31. Insurance coverage during post-completion OPT If you already have IU International Student Insurance through IUPUI, it will expire at the end of the period of insurance coverage, regardless of when you complete your program. The last day of coverage for Spring/Summer insurance is July 31, and the last day of fall insurance coverage is December 31.  Our best suggestion for OPT students who will not register for classes is to use the insurance offered through your employer. If you register for classes at IUPUI any time during your OPT period, you will be billed automatically for IU International insurance. If your OPT employer will provide you with U.S.-based insurance coverage, and you would like to request exemption from mandatory student insurance enrollment, you must complete a Health Insurance Exemption Request in Atlas . If your OPT employer does not provide you with insurance coverage and you would like to enroll in the IU International plan during OPT, contact iadvisor@iupui.edu . Have a graduate assistantship or fellowship? The university has separate insurance plans for students with assistantships or fellowships. Check with your academic department to ask if they will provide you with health insurance. If yes, the IU Human Resources website has more information about insurance plans for Graduate Appointees and Fellowship Recipients.

If you are an international student or scholar at IUPUI and purchased the IU International health insurance plan, then all of the options below are covered under that plan. The insurance benefits included in the plan change slightly each academic year. Be sure to verify information about your insurance coverage. Learn more . If you have a different insurance plan, contact your insurance company to confirm which medical providers are covered under your insurance plan. IUPUI Student Health and Campus Health If you are a student at IUPUI, or a scholar without employee benefits, your first source for medical care is either the IUPUI Campus Health Office (Coleman Hall) or the Campus Center Student Health Office. Both offices can help you with routine health care, illnesses and injuries including: Cold and flu Skin conditions Sports injury Asthma care Women’s health Immunizations Urgent Care If you have a non-emergency injury or illness that needs immediate assistance but the IUPUI health center locations are closed, you can visit an Urgent Care center. They can provide many of the services that your doctor would provide and are open on evenings and weekends. The following locations are a 10-minute walk from campus, and are covered under Aetna insurance: Healthcare Clinic at Walgreens 1530 North Meridian Street Indianapolis, IN 46202-2307 (866) 825-3227 MinuteClinic CVS pharmacy 1545 North Meridian Street Indianapolis, IN 46202-2306 (866) 389-272 Pharmacies In the United States, you must have a prescription written by a Medical Doctor to purchase many medications. If your doctor gives you a prescription (for a medication), then you need to visit a local pharmacy to purchase it. The closest pharmacies are a 10-minute walk from campus: Walgreens 1530 North Meridian Street Indianapolis, IN 46202-2307 (866) 825-3227 CVS pharmacy 1545 North Meridian Street Indianapolis, IN 46202-2306 (866) 389-272 Emergency Care If you have a true health emergency you should go to a hospital emergency room. If you have Aetna insurance, you should go to the IU Health Methodist Hospital emergency room at 1701 North Senate Blvd, near downtown Indianapolis. You should never use an emergency room for non-emergencies! It is the most expensive health care option. Anthem Preferred Providers Anthem administers the IU International Student and Scholar Health Insurance. If you are seeking medical care outside of the options listed above, be sure to use health care providers in Anthem's network. These are called “Network Providers.” If you go to a provider outside the Aetna network, then your medical care will be more expensive. Find an Anthem Preferred Provider » Dental Care Dental care is expensive in the United States, and is not included in most health insurance plans. You can save money on dental care by receiving services through the Indiana University School of Dentistry. Quality services are available under the supervision of professional licensed dentists. Visit the School of Dentistry Patient Services site » Call 911 for help in an emergency. If you have a life-threatening emergency and cannot get to the hospital yourself, call 911. An ambulance will be sent for you. However, ambulance rides are expensive, and your insurance may not pay for the entire cost. Feeling depressed or anxious? IUPUI Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) has experience helping international students cope with relationship problems, depression, and the stress and anxiety of being far from home.

This is called a homestay. Whether you are a student, scholar, worker, or visitor, a homestay can be an excellent way for short-term or long-term housing. Homestay Benefits A homestay can be an affordable option, and it will give you an opportunity to experience daily life in the U.S. Your host will help you become comfortable with life in Indianapolis. You will explore the city, experience local culture and customs, and have daily opportunities to practice your English. Many people who choose homestays develop close bonds with their hosts, who can be single people or couples, young or old. Homestays vary, but they typically include a private bedroom, most meals, utilities, and homestay orientation or training. Homestays do not include transportation, but they are often near public transportation. Find a Homestay The Office of International Affairs does not arrange homestays. Instead, we highly recommend the following organizations, which can help you find a suitable homestay. International Homestay Consultants, Inc.

Whether you want to live in IUPUI housing or off campus, make sure to arrange your housing early. Students should look for housing as soon as possible after they are admitted. Many Housing Options On-campus housing is a convenient option for students, and includes social programs and academic support. Apply for housing by March 15, to be placed on the priority consideration list for on-campus housing. Off-campus housing includes several options near campus, and can be an economical option. International House is an on-campus residence for students from around the world who are interested in global issues. Live with an American host to have a special experience that can also be very affordable. Consider These Questions Do you prefer to live on campus or off campus? If you want to live off campus, how close to campus do you want to be? How much money do you want to spend? Do housing costs include electricity and other utilities? If you will pay for utilities separately, how much will you have to pay per month? Do you want to live by yourself or with others? Are there other people from your country whom you could live with or who could help you find housing? Is the housing furnished, or will you have to supply your own furniture? Short-Term Housing If you arrive at a time when you cannot move into your housing (for example, if you arrive on campus before move-in day) you will need to stay at a hotel. The Office of International Affairs Welcome Team ( iwelcome@iupui.edu ) is happy to provide resources and suggestions for downtown Indianapolis hotels. If you will be at IUPUI for only a short time, your best options are to live with an American host or look at the Roommates & Sublets listings in the \"Classifieds\" on One.iu.edu . Start Your Housing Search: Quick Tips! Choose the part of the IUPUI campus map you might like to live near. Familiarize yourself with all the housing options IUPUI has to offer . Read “How to apply for On-Campus Housing” below. Inform yourself about the on-campus housing options available at IUPUI. Browse the OIA and Division of Student Affairs sites for information about off campus living. Search for roommates or open room options. Search and click on “Classifieds” on One.iu.edu and then “Roommates & Sublets”.

You can choose among housing in all areas of town and at all price ranges. Good Places to Look for Apartments in Indianapolis You can also log into the \"Classifieds\" on One.iu.edu and look at \"Roommates & Sublets\". This will help you find a property to rent or sublet (lease from a person who is already leasing the property). You can also look at the International Student Facebook group to see who is looking for new roommates. Visit the Department of Student Affairs website for more details on off-campus housing options and properties within two miles of the IUPUI campus. Help with Choosing Off-Campus Housing We provide resources to help international students, scholars and visitors find living accommodations in Indianapolis. Start with the information below, and contact us if you need additional assistance. IUPUI's Housing and Residence Life office has also created a list of some housing options located near campus to help with your search, as well as a guide for living off-campus . What to Do When You Look for an Off-Campus Rental Shop around and compare prices. Consider all costs, not just rent. Some housing includes rent, furniture, electricity, and other services/utilities in one price. Other rentals may just charge rent, and you have to pay for furniture, electricity, and other costs separately. Living far from campus may require you to purchase a car. Consider finding a furnished rental that has all utilities already set up for your first rental. This can help your move to Indianapolis go more smoothly. Check the deposit policy to see if it is refundable. Check the lease duration. If you are not going to be in Indianapolis for 12 months, consider subleasing an apartment. Ask questions of former and current tenants if possible. Get everything you agree upon in writing. Read the entire lease before you sign it. Be sure that you understand all the terms of the contract you sign. Be aware that when your name is on the apartment lease, you can be held fully responsible for the rent if your roommate does not pay his or her full share. Do not sign a lease until you have inspected the apartment, house, or room in person. You will probably not be able to inspect the property in person if you are arranging your housing while you are still outside the United States, but keep this in mind for future housing. Do not sign a lease if you do not agree with all of the terms. Try to negotiate until you can come to an understanding. Keep in mind that some apartment landlords will require a large deposit in advance if you do not have a Social Security number. On-campus housing does not have this requirement. Common Housing Abbreviations You may see some of these abbreviations as you browse rental listings: AC: air conditioning Avail: available BA: bathroom blks: blocks BR: bedroom DR: dining room DW: dishwasher frplc: fireplace furn: furnished gar: garage incl: included kit: kitchen lg: large /mo: per month pd: paid util: utilities (gas, water, electric) w/: with W/D: washer and dryer Renter’s Insurance Renter’s insurance covers the value of the belongings you keep in your rental property in case of theft, fire, or other damage. We recommend that you purchase it. Most major insurance providers in the United States offer renter’s insurance. Schools for Children Indianapolis has 11 public school districts. All of them provide free education for children in grades kindergarten through twelfth grade, regardless of citizenship status. Indianapolis also has many private schools. Before you decide where to live, we recommend that you verify the school district, research its educational programs, and consider whether you will send your child to public or private school. Learn about Indianapolis schools » Temporary Housing If you arrive at a time when you cannot move into your housing (for example, if your apartment’s office is closed), you will need to stay at a hotel. There are some hotels that have special rates for IUPUI visitors . Off-Campus Housing Resources Off-Campus Student Services offers a variety of services, and enables you to be successful throughout your college experience.

The IUPUI works hard to protect you and make campus a safe academic community. We also encourage you to protect yourself and others whenever possible. However, if you’re the victim of a crime or a scam , it’s not your fault . IUPUI has a dedicated and helpful police department (IUPD) . IUPD is a support resource you can use when you have questions related to personal safety. IUPUI wants to provide a safe and positive environment for everyone. If you think you’re being discriminated against for any reason, you should report the incident . If you are in imminent danger or require immediate assistance, call 911 or contact the Indiana University Police Department at 317-274-7911. Staying safe and avoiding scams Download the Guardian app The Guardian safety app gives you access to personal safety resources and can help you more easily reach police. Get emergency alerts, use a safe walk timer, and more. Learn more about Guardian Don’t fall for a scam Scammers often target international students and scholars, often pretending to be government or immigration officials. Keep your personal information and money safe by knowing what to expect. Learn more about avoiding scams Staying safe in personal relationships Personal relationships differ from country to country. In the United States, we highly value mutual respect. You don’t have to tolerate any violence, including sexual or relationship violence or stalking, even if you’re in a relationship with the person. If you’ve been the victim of a such an event, the university and local law enforcement can help you. We strongly encourage you to seek help . Anything you report is kept private If you report a problem or issue to the university, IUPUI won’t tell your family or community. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) , a U.S. government law about your privacy, means that in general, we are not allowed to share any information with your family unless either of the following is true: You give specific permission for us to do so There is a serious threat to health or safety Emergency notifications IU has a system called IU Notify to spread emergency notifications. It sends out warning messages if there is an event on or around the Bloomington campus, like severe weather, fires, violent crimes, and dangerous situations. Your IU email address is automatically enrolled in IU Notify when you come to campus. You can also add your phone number (for text or call notifications) or other email addresses. You can even add your family members so they receive these notifications as well. What to do in adverse weather Sometimes Indianapolis experiences bad weather. It’s important to know what to do before an incident happens. Severe thunderstorms and tornadoes can occur in Indiana. Although they can happen any time in the year, they are more likely in the spring and summer. The National Weather Service (NWS) provides warnings when severe weather is occurring. Tornado watches and warnings A tornado watch means weather conditions are favorable for a tornado, and this is a time to be aware and prepared to act. A tornado warning means you need to seek shelter immediately by moving to an interior room on the lowest floor with no windows (basements and bathrooms are often your best option). Winter weather In the winter, we experience cold temperatures and snowstorms. Usually there is plenty of notice of these events so you have time to prepare (making sure you have enough food and supplies for a couple of days). Other emergencies There are other emergency situations that could happen anytime, anywhere. Knowing what to do in a situation could make all the difference. Learn about other emergency situations Prepare in advance Being prepared can help you stay safe in the event of an emergency. Sign up for IU-Notify Sign up for IU-Notify to receive alerts in an emergency. Be sure to keep your contact information current. Program your phone with important numbers 317-274-7233 (SAFE) will connect you to the IUPUI Safewalk service 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to walk you safely anywhere on campus. 911 is the emergency number for anywhere in the United States. Use this for a life-threatening emergency. Designate a personal emergency contact for a close friend or relative who can help. Notify OIA of this contact through the Your Information eform in Atlas . Also memorize the same numbers, in case your phone is not available. Install a weather app on your phone Indiana experiences frequent changes in the weather. Severe weather, such as strong thunderstorms with high winds and hail, winter storms, and even tornados are possible. A watch means that severe weather is possible. Stay alert and avoid travelling in a location where you cannot quickly seek shelter if needed A warning means that severe weather is occurring. Most weather warnings are based on County locations. All of Indianapolis is located in Marion County . Install a weather app on your phone so you can monitor the situation and stay safe. View a map of Indiana counties » Plan to explore the city –safely Follow these basic tips when you are exploring the city: Use a map to help you get to know different areas, whether walking, driving, or taking a taxi. Don’t walk alone late at night, even for short distances. Stay in well-lit, public areas. Walk “with purpose”– show that you know where you are going. If someone is making you uncomfortable, get near a crowd of people and ask for help. Prepare ahead for apartment living If you will live in an apartment, follow these safety guidelines: Keep doors and windows locked. Get to know your neighbors–introduce yourself. Make sure you have a working smoke detector, fire extinguisher, and first aid kit. Don’t let unknown persons into your home. Purchase a Renter’s Insurance Policy. You cannot expect to receive compensation if anything happens to your belongings due to severe weather, fire, or theft if you do not have insurance. Understand procedures for different emergencies Every emergency situation is different. Having a plan of what you will do in a specific type of emergency can help you make good decisions in case the emergency ever happens to you. Learn about emergency response procedures » Learn about local laws Understanding and following basic laws and local procedures can help you stay safe and avoid difficult situations. Alcohol, smoking, and drugs The legal age for drinking alcohol in Indiana is 21 Never drink and drive. Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) or Driving Under the Influence (DUI) are treated as serious crimes. Marijuana is illegal in Indiana. Tobacco is legal, but cannot be used in most public locations. IUPUI is a smoke-free campus. In Indiana, it is illegal to smoke within eight feet (approximately two meters) in front of building entrances. You are legally and personally responsible for your actions, no matter what the situation.

Find more tips for avoiding scams on the Social Security Administration, USA.gov, and USCIS websites. If you ever receive a phone call or email asking about your immigration status, personal information, or seeking immediate payment, be suspicious. It is important that you protect your personal information. Neither U.S. government agencies nor IUPUI representatives would require payment from you via phone, email, gift card or payment app (such as Zelle or Venmo). All requests for official payments will arrive on government stationery. Our office will always use your IU email for formal communication. Contact us with any questions about potential scams. Reporting scams will not affect your immigration application, petition, or status. Example scam You may receive a call from someone requesting your personal information and threatening you by saying the police (or other agencies) will arrest or deport you for not filling out a form or not paying your taxes. They may also accuse you of having a suspended social security number. The call may be a robo-call (meaning it's a recording and not a human that is talking) making urgent callback requests. Sometimes criminals even use spoofing services to choose the number or name that shows up on your phone. That means the call may appear to be coming from a government agency, but it is a trick. It's also possible that the scammer might have your personal information such as your name, birthday, and the last four characters of your I-94 identifier. If contacted in this manner, you should immediately be suspicious. Ask for the person's full name, agency, reporting office, and a government telephone number to call the person back. They will likely tell you must act immediately. Don't believe them. End the call and seek guidance from our office. See a list of common scams What to do if a scammer contacts you If you receive a call demanding personal information or payment, hang up immediately. If you receive an email demanding personal information or payment, do not respond. You can contact our office for guidance if you’re not sure if something is real. You can verify if you were contacted by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) by doing one of the following: Call the National Customer Service Center (1-800-375-5283) to ask if you need to do anything about your case or immigration status. Make an InfoPass appointment . Use myUSCIS to find up-to-date information about your application (if you have one). Reporting a scam You can report scams in one or more of the following ways. If you receive a suspicious email, forward it to USCIS at USCIS.Webmaster@uscis.dhs.gov . Contact the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at 877-FTC-Help or file a complaint online . Call IUPUI Campus Safety ( 317-274-2058 ). Being a smart consumer Ultimately, we want you to think critically about things before you respond. If a deal sounds too good to be true, it probably is. While we may want to believe that people are honest, it isn't always true. If someone is pressuring you to make a quick decision, that’s probably a sign that something isn’t quite right. If you’re signing up for a service or purchase online—and it’s not a website known to you—review the terms and conditions instead of just automatically clicking the box that says you agree. Steps you can take to protect against fraud Keep your social security card in a secure place at home. Be cautious about giving your full social security number over the phone, especially if you did not initiate the interaction; never send it by email or text. Do not give anyone login information for any online accounts. Do not let anyone claiming to be a US government official pressure you to make wire transfers, purchase gift cards, or pay them with digital currency. Be cautiously skeptical about phone numbers and email addresses claiming to represent government agencies; check to see if the email address seems “ phishy . If you are concerned that someone calling you is pretending to be a government official, ask for their name and title and inform them you will contact the agency through official channels, such as the phone number published on an official government website. Examples of a business or government transaction that would legitimately require your social security number: Filing an immigration benefit application Engaging in employment Filing a tax return Applying for a driver’s license Opening a bank account Applying for a line of credit Renting an apartment or applying for a mortgage Applying for a professional license Enrolling in health insurance or accessing medical care Review the Social Security , USCIS , and the USA.gov webpages for more tips about avoiding scams.

Find Free and Discounted Software Cellular Phones in the United States Cellular phone companies (also called mobile phone companies or wireless providers) allow two payment models for service: postpaid service and prepaid service. You will need to decide which option is right for you. Postpaid Service Postpaid wireless service is the traditional arrangement. You sign a contract agreeing to pay a certain amount each month for the agreed-upon service. The provider delivers the service to you continuously and bills you each month. Large deposits are usually required, especially for people without Social Security numbers. This deposit is normally refunded at some point, although this varies by phone service provider. Prepaid Service All major cell phone providers in the United States offer prepaid wireless plans. When you buy prepaid wireless service, a provider makes an agreed-upon number of minutes available to your cell phone. You pay for those minutes at the time of agreement. After you have used the minutes you purchased, you need to buy more minutes to be able to keep using your phone. This option does not typically require a credit check or a deposit. How Should I Choose a Provider? You will want to choose a wireless service that provides competitive rates for calling your home country. Many students use their cell phone as their main means of communication. Low international rates will enable you to keep in touch with people at home without paying high fees. If you are a married student or are moving to Indianapolis with additional family members, choosing a company that offers additional lines at competitive fees can keep your monthly costs lower. Also, look at the wireless providers offering free mobile-to-mobile minutes. This enables you to call the other family members on your plan without using your minutes.

This does not constitute a full-time course load, but options for students at this level of English proficiency are limited. On a case-by-case basis, the EAP Program may allow a student to retest to see if a student can place into G9/G10 with a second attempt. This exception would only be made if the student had extenuating circumstances that may have affected the results of the first test, such as illness or extreme jet lag . Retests should be coordinated with the EAP department at e sl@iupui.edu . Students retesting into G9/G10 may enroll full-time without restrictions. Visa Status Concerns Students enrolled part-time while on an F-1 visa must obtain approval from the Office of International Affairs to take a reduced course load. The deadline for obtaining approval is the last day of the 25% refund period. To request permission to take a reduced course load: Students log into iStart.iu.edu and complete the form titled Reduced Course Load: Academic Difficulties . Student enters the reason for the request as well as their academic advisor’s name/email. The advisor receives an email with a link to verify the student’s request. Submission of the form routes it back to OIA. OIA will approve the request, notify the student and advisor, and update the student’s immigration record with the approval. Students should be advised that they can reduce their course load based on academic difficulties only once during their degree program.

This work authorization is granted for work relating to the student's field of studey. For detailed questions, students and advisors should contact iadvisor@iupui.edu . See Academic Training eligibility requirements» Curricular Practical Training, CPT CPT work authorization is granted when the F-1 student has an employment opportunity directly relating to the completion of their degree. See CPT eligibility requirements» Students must be registered for a course related to the employment experience, and which counts towards a degree requirement. The course may be an elective, but it must be used to reach the minimum credit hours to graduate. Once your student requests this benefit through the Atlas system, you will be sent a request for confirmation of academic necessity via email. See an example of this request. Common CPT Questions What does OIA mean by \"Integral to Curriculum\" in the CPT eForm for Advisors? Immigration regulations require that employment be considered integral to the student’s curriculum in order to be eligible for the off-campus work authorization. The way we ensure this is by requiring the student to be registered for a course that connects to the employment experience. That course MUST be used to satisfy some type of program requirement. By clicking ‘Yes’ on the CPT e-form, you are attesting that the credit earned by this employment opportunity is counting towards the student’s degree. This could be in the form of a general elective credit, major/general requirement, or thesis/dissertation completion. If the credits earned are above and beyond the requirements for the degree, the student is likely ineligible for CPT. What does OIA need if the student is completing an optional/required internship? We need to know what course the student will be registered for. For example, MBET 29500 HETM Internship. The student is completing an internship to meet an Independent Study Course requirement. What do advisors need to give OIA? We need to know what course the student will earn credit for. Additionally, the course instructor will need to upload a memo explaining how the employment will fulfill the required course components. This memo should be specific and detailed. See an example of a memo that accomplishes this. The employment the student is seeking will help with their Thesis/Dissertation/Project Research. What do advisors need to supply OIA? The student must be registered for a thesis/dissertation/project course. It is also possible to grant a student work authorization with registration for GRAD G599 (course permission granted through the Graduate School and requires student to be eligible) or other departmental equivalent. Additionally, the thesis/dissertation/project advisor will need to submit a memo detailing: What are the duties of the employment? What are the details of the thesis/dissertation/project? How does the employment contribute materially and substantially to the research? Why is the employment necessary to complete the thesis/dissertation/project. See an example of a memo that accomplishes what we need » Optional Practical Training, OPT OPT is work authorization reserved for F-1 students upon completion of their degree. In some cases students also use OPT part-time during their degree. See eligibility requirements» Students can apply for OPT 90 days prior to completing their program requirements through 60 days immediately following program completion. Common OPT Questions What does OIA mean by “Completion Date” on the Verification of Pending Program Completion form? The immigration service considers a student to have completed their program on the last day of finals for the last semester or the thesis submission date–whichever is later. The completion date normally occurs before the graduation date. Similarly, incomplete grades are not considered part of the remaining program. This is important as it determines the student’s eligibility period to apply for this benefit. On the Verification of Pending Program Completion form, what dates does OIA really need for a student on a thesis/dissertation option? We need to have an estimated thesis/dissertation defense and submission date. Immigration considers the final submission as the completion of program which impacts when the student is eligible to apply for OPT and begin working. A student with a thesis/dissertation requirement wants me to help apply for OPT, but the student has not completed his/her dissertation yet. Can s/he still apply for post-completion OPT? Yes! As long as the student has completed all of their coursework, they are eligible to apply for post-completion OPT. Some students choose to do this so they only have to pay one OPT application fee. It is fine for the student to continue to work on a thesis/dissertation while on approved OPT. The student should contact OIA if they are enrolled and do not want to receive the IUPUI International Student Health Insurance. I am working with a student who has not completed all their coursework yet. Is there any way for this student to apply for OPT early? Yes! The student can apply for PRE-completion OPT. Pre-completion OPT requires many of the same pieces of documentation, but does not require the student to have finished his or her degree. The student can make an appointment with an International Advisor to find out more details. Social Security Numbers International students are not eligible to apply for SSNs without employment. See more SSN resources. Tax Information International students are required to pay taxes every year. OIA provides extensive resources to students on this topic. See more tax resources.

A student's enrollment requirement can be affected by several factors. See full-time enrollment guidelines» We understand that students may face situations where enrolling full-time may not be in their best interest. Immigration regulations allow a few exceptions to enrolling full-time» Students must receive permission from OIA before they enroll less than full-time or drop a course. Common Enrollment Problems Requesting a reduced course load due to Academic Reasons See an example of a Request for Reduced Course Load eForm. Students have only one semester during their academic program in which s/he can enroll less than full-time due to academic difficulties. The student MUST request advance approval and MUST remain registered for half of their full-time enrollment requirement. After a student requests an enrollment exception, you will receive an eForm request via email. Please remember these are time sensitive. We must report on each student’s enrollment the Monday following the end of the 25% refund period. If the student requested the exception, but the request was not completed by the advisor, the result may mean that the student loses their legal status. Administrative Withdrawals Many international students come from educational systems where attendance is optional. Please help us to reinforce that IUPUI requires attendance. Administrative withdrawals may have a negative impact on the international student’s immigration status. When a withdrawal will cause a student to drop below full-time, the Registrar notifies OIA. We refer students to academic advisors for help with adding additional courses or seeking an enrollment exception if possible. If the student fails to take action or is unable to, the student will lose their legal status in the US and be contacted by our office for further options. Complete Withdrawals/Leave of Absence It is possible that a student may come to you requesting to withdraw from all his/her courses. This is permitted, though there are some serious immigration consequences for the student to consider. The student should NOT drop courses before first consulting with an OIA Advisor and getting OIA approval. See the procedure to request a complete withdrawal» If the student is requesting to withdraw due to a medical condition, he/she may be able to remain in the U.S. See information regarding a medical withdrawal» Concurrent Enrollment at Two or More Institutions See Concurrent Enrollment information» Academic advisors do not need to confirm concurrent enrollment; OIA will do this. Students will need to have at least one credit enrollment at IUPUI and are still held to the online enrollment limit. Additionally, sponsored students are expected to ensure that their sponsor is aware of the dual enrollment and that their tuition/fees are paid at the second institution. If students are taking courses at Ivy Tech, they can use the Passport Program . International students must include a copy of their I-20 with the guest student application every semester. Students are required to complete the Concurrent Enrollment Verification eForm located in their F-1 Student Services menu (in Atlas) and attach a copy of their course schedule showing mode of instruction and credit hours. OIA reviews these verifications to ensure the student is enrolled full-time and will send the student approval or notify if there is a problem. Online Enrollment See online enrollment guidelines. Sponsored students must seek approval from their financial sponsor to ensure that tuition/fees for online coursework are paid. Additional student scenarios include: Acceptable An undergraduate student has one (3 credit) online course and nine credits of face-to-face coursework all at IUPUI. An undergraduate student has three (1 credit) online courses (3 credits total) and nine credits of face-to-face coursework all at IUPUI. An undergraduate student has one (3 credit) online course at Ivy Tech and nine credits of face-to-face coursework at IUPUI. ( Along with a concurrent enrollment request ). An undergraduate student has six credits of online courses and nine credits of face-to-face coursework. ( Student is enrolled in 15 credits total ) An undergraduate student has an approved reduced course load request (making full-time enrollment 6 credit hours) three credits of online course work and three credits of face-to-face coursework. A graduate student with a student academic appointment (full-time enrollment is only 6 hours) has a three credit online course and three credits of face-to-face coursework. A graduate student with 3 credits of online coursework, 3 credits of hybrid coursework, and 3 credits of face-to-face coursework. Unacceptable An undergraduate student has six credits of online courses and six credits of face-to-face coursework. Unacceptable (only 3 credits of online work can be used to satisfy the full-time enrollment requirement of 12 credit hours) A student has one credit left to graduate and is taking that course online. Unacceptable, even though the student is taking the last course needed to graduate, s/he must have at least one credit of face-to-face coursework for immigration to consider his presence in the US required. Change of Major/Program Once an undergraduate student has changed their major and it is properly displayed in their SIS plan stack, a student should contact iadvisor@iupui.edu to request their I-20 be updated. Sponsored students are responsible for seeking approval from their sponsor before changing majors. At the graduate level, if a student changes his/her degree level (jumps from a MS program to a Ph.D. program) s/he should contact iadvisor@iupui.edu . OIA advisors will review the record to determine if new financial documentation is needed and issue an updated I-20 reflecting the student’s actual intention. If a graduate student is admitted into a new program, s/he will generally be contacted by iadvisor@iupui.edu for new funding documentation and to receive his/her new I-20. Extension of Program Students are given the average time it takes for a student to complete a degree on their initial I-20/DS-2019 (undergraduates = 5 years, master’s students = 2.5 years, Ph.D. students = 6 years). Students may request an extension of I-20 in Atlas. Common reasons to extend include changes in research, unexpected problems with research, an abundance of preparatory courses, lack of course availability, etc. Unacceptable reasons to extend an I-20 include wanting to take courses not academically necessary (above and beyond) to meet degree requirements, failing too many courses (similar to financial aid standard), and extending graduation for employment reasons. Once requested by the student, advisors will receive an eForm via email. Advisors need to complete the form before we can process the extension. We need to understand what a reasonable graduation date will be as well as the number of remaining credits. If you do not support the extension, please let us know that. See an example of the extension eForm you will receive» SIS Service Indicators Preventing Enrollment OIA uses negative service indicators as a final measure to obtain mandatory student compliance. We use “A23 SEVIS Compliance” and “A11 International Transcript Needed” indicators. Students can read the instructions included in the notes to discover what must be completed to have indicators released.

U.S. citizens and permanent residents educated abroad are processed in the same office as domestic students. Learn more about the Admissions Process » Returning Students Students who have stopped out for only one semester just need to contact iadvisor@iupui.edu . OIA advisors will collect new financial documentation and issue immigration documents after working with the student. Students who have stopped out for two semesters or more need to follow normal returning student processes to be reinstated academically. If the student is returning after a dismissal, advisors may be contacted by OIA advisors to ensure that the student has been readmitted and is free to return.

Even if the scholar will not have an employment relationship with IUPUI (will not be paid by IUPUI), the department should still initiate an \"add a new person\" e-doc for an academic no-pay position. Please always use the search match function before initiating a new e-doc to make sure that the new employee has not previously been assigned a university ID number. For a person without a social security number use \"999-99-9999.\" For a person outside the U.S., use the department address. If the employee will have an academic \"no pay\" position, you can complete the hire at any time even if the employee is not at IUPUI. This type of employment relationship does not require an I-9. Therefore you may want to complete the hire in advance of arrival, in order to facilitate access to e-mail and other university systems. Please note this is not possible for someone who will be in a paid employment relationship with IUPUI (requiring an I-9). After the department has initiated an \"add a new person\" e-doc for either a non-immigrant or permanent resident employee (either paid or unpaid), the e-doc will route to OIA. OIA does an evaluation of current immigration status and adds relevant visa permit and citizenship data. If the employee is currently in the U.S. in a non-immigrant status we will need more documentation than the department needs to complete the I-9. Although an employment authorization document (ead) may indicate the ability to work in the U.S., we will need to see further documents which verify citizenship and visa permit status. Please submit to OIA: Copy of the personal profile form Copy of supporting visa documents such as: passport, I-94 card, I-797 approval notice, I-20, DS-2019, or permanent resident card. If you are unsure of the scholar's current visa status, send us the documents that you have and we will make a determination of what further documentation is needed. If the employee is outside of the U.S. and will enter the U.S. in a non-immigrant status in the future, please submit to OIA: Copy of personal profile form. Copy of passport (if available) In the notes section at the bottom of the e-doc indicate the visa type that will be requested and that this person is outside the US. OIA will add the relevant data and approve the e-doc. Our office will send you an e-mail message with the university id number once the e-doc has been approved. Please note that your non-immigrant employee can rarely complete their portion of the E-Verify I-9 certification until their first date of employment with IU.

Please contact OIA for additional information on how the dependents can acquire H-4 status. It is important to know the dependents’ projected travel plans before we file the petition.  Should the dependent leave the U.S. once the petition is filed, it may affect their ability to be approved for H-4 status.

In general, most H-1B-related costs are considered by federal regulation to be the business expense of the employer and significant fines can result from failure to adhere to these regulations. For this reason, IUPUI hiring departments cannot allow their employees to assume the cost of most filing fees. Exceptions are noted in the discussion below. Following is an explanation of the various H-1B-related fees and how they are typically handled. Fees Charged by the Office of International Affairs USD $757 processing fee This fee covers OIA costs for processing and filing the H-1B petition. Requests to process an H-1B petition must include a departmental account number for FIS billing. The charge will be applied at the time the request is received and is 50% refundable if the prospective employee withdraws his/her acceptance of the employment offer prior to submission of the petition to the USCIS. Once the petition is submitted to the USCIS, the fee is non-refundable. Please be aware that Contracts & Grants has advised that this fee cannot be charged to grant accounts. Please note that this fee will be assessed every time OIA prepares a new H-1B petition. It is assumed that H-1B employees will not be asked to reimburse for H-1B related fees charged directly to a campus unit. Fees Charged by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) USCIS $460 base filing fees The basic USCIS filing fee of USD $460 applies to all H-1B petitions. The department must pay the USD $460 filing fee, but you may require the employee to assume the filing fee for their dependents . There is never an obligation for the employer to pay dependent-related immigration fees. USD $500 USCIS \"anti-fraud\" fee USCIS requires all new H-1B petitions for H-1B status to include the USD $500 anti-fraud fee in addition to the base USD $460 filing fee. This fee applies to all petitions for changes of visa status (e.g. from F-1 or J-1 to H-1B), petitions for a new employee from overseas, and petitions for new employees already in H-1B status with another U.S. employer. The fee is not required for H-1B extensions for current H-1B employees. USD $2500 Premium Processing Fee (Optional) For an additional USD $2500 fee, USCIS offers premium processing within 15 working days, and will refund the fee if it does not review the petition within this timeframe. If you elect to use the premium processing option to obtain more timely employment authorization, you will be responsible for payment of the fee. If the employee elects to use premium processing in order to facilitate personal travel outside the U.S. or for other personal reasons not connected with the dates of employment authorization, the employee may pay the fee. In ambiguous cases where it may not be immediately obvious whether payment of the fee should be considered a business expense, OIA will review the reasons for the request and make a final determination on whether the employee can be allowed to pay the fee. An H-1B petition can normally be prepared for submission to the USCIS within 2-3 months, assuming that required supporting documentation is provided without delay and no salary complications arise. Processing time at the USCIS may take 3-4 months, and in some cases longer. Persons already in valid H-1B status may be employed at IUPUI as soon as the petition is receipted by the USCIS. All others without currently valid authorization for the proposed employment at IUPUI must delay employment until the H-1B petition is approved. Please note : DO NOT cancel a check unless instructed by an OIA Staff Member.

Start here. The H-1B Visa is a temporary work visa for non-U.S. workers. H-1B workers must be in an occupation that requires at least a bachelor’s degree (or the equivalent) at the entry level. At IUPUI, H-1B status is used for full-time, tenure-track faculty; academic researchers; research technicians (RS07 level or higher); and professional staff.  Generally the university does not sponsor part-time H-1B employment.  However in some cases exceptions can be made to the part-time rules.  Please contact OIA for further information regarding the details of your campus position. In order to obtain H-1B status for an employee, the hiring department must document the appropriateness of the wages, the duties and responsibilities of the position, and the employee’s qualifications to fill that position. Click here for a detailed flowchart on the H-1B hiring process. Learn how to request a new H1-B Visa ›› Learn how to extend an H-1B Visa ›› Fees The H-1B process involves several fees. The department must assume all business-related expenses for filing the H-1B petition . Learn more about H-1B fees » Requirements H-1B visas are subject to extensive U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and Department of Labor (DOL) regulations. Terms of Employment An H-1B employee must be employed according to the terms described in the H-1B petition submitted to USCIS. After the petition has been filed and approved, all changes in employment status—including change in job title, transfer of department, change in full-time status, or termination—require the prior review of the Office of International Affairs. We will ensure compliance with all H-1B regulations. Prevailing and Actual Wages Employers must certify that the worker will be paid the prevailing wage for that occupation or the actual wage at the place of employment, whichever is higher. The prevailing wage is the “going rate” for that position in the employer’s geographic area, as determined by the DOL. The actual wage is the employer’s usual rate of pay for that position within the IUPUI department. For this reason, departments cannot reduce the salary of an H-1B employee below the level that is reported when the H-1B petition is prepared. Length of Status If the employee is terminated before the end date of the H-1B approval notice—even if it is for cause or due to a loss of funding—the hiring department is liable for the cost of return transportation to the employee’s home country. Therefore, we recommend that your department apply for H-1B status for only the time period for which funding is reasonably certain, up to the maximum of three years that are allowed for an initial petition or extension. Timeline Processing of H-1B petitions can take several months, so be sure to plan ahead. OIA will start preparing the H-1B petition after your department initiates the Add a New Person e-doc and completes the electronic request for the H-1B (e-form) in Atlas. If you are extending an employee’s H-1B status or the case involves premium processing, plan for the H-1B petition to take three months.

Your department is responsible for recruiting and selecting your international scholars and workers. After you have either identified your candidate for employment or invited a visiting scholar to collaborate with you, we can help with the process of getting a nonimmigrant visa. You can reach us at ischolar@iupui.edu . Three Main International Scholar Visas J-1 Exchange Visitor status is for paid or unpaid academic appointments. H-1B specialty worker status is for a temporary employee in a position that requires at least a bachelor’s degree. B-1 or B-2 visitor status is for someone who is coming for independent research, a workshop, or a conference. Learn more in our visa status comparison chart ›› Which Visa Status Is Right for Your Scholar? Not Employed by IUPUI If the scholar will not be employed by IUPUI and will not receive an honorarium or compensation, your options are the J-1 scholar visa or the B-1 tourist visa . We recommend the J-1 visa for anyone who will stay at IUPUI for at least six months with the possibility of an extension. Employed by IUPUI If the scholar will be a full-time IUPUI employee, your options are the J-1 scholar visa or the H-1B specialty worker visa . The H-1B visa includes a broader range of job classifications because the minimum qualification is that the job requires a bachelor’s degree. Only the H-1B visa can be used for a tenure-track position. The J-1 visa requires that the employee be appointed to an academic position. Exceptions can be made for professional PA positions as appropriate. At IUPUI, it also requires that the employee be enrolled in a graduate program, have a graduate degree, or have a professional degree. Student Employees and Student Interns For information on student employment, see our pages about J-1 student interns and J-1 and F-1 students . Only people who are enrolled full time in classes or are obtaining a degree are considered students for visa purposes. As an employing department for a student using OPT STEM extension, you will need to complete the form I-983. Instructions can be found here . Workshops and Events for Scholars OIA offers weekly orientation sessions and other programming for scholars, among many other international events. Find upcoming events in our events calendar . Less Common Visas O-1 Alien of Extraordinary Ability IUPUI uses this visa for employees who are not eligible for an H-1B because they have used all of their H-1B time or because of barriers such as the waiver requirement. The O-1 is an administratively extensive visa that requires that IUPUI show that the employee is at the top of his or her specialty field. OIA will determine whether this visa is a possibility after reviewing the credentials of the employee. Please contact us: ischolar@iupui.edu if you are interested in using this visa. TN Trade NAFTA TN status is available to Canadian and Mexican citizens in specified fields, including university teaching, research, and dentistry. The position must be considered temporary. Please contact us: ischolar@iupui.edu to see if your offered position qualifies for TN status. E-3 Australian Specialty Worker Citizens of Australia may qualify for this visa for professional and academic appointments. The position requirements are very similar to those of an H-1B, including that the position must require a bachelor’s degree or higher. Please contact us: ischolar@iupui.edu if an Australian citizen will fill your offered position.

Employment is an important way for international students to become adjusted to American culture, and you can be part of that growing experience. Students on F-1 and J-1 visas are eligible to work on-campus, but limitations apply. Learn about employment regulations for F-1 students» Learn about employment regulations for J-1 students» Students on an F-1 or J-1 visa are limited to working 20 hours/week during the fall and spring semesters. They can work full-time on their summer, winter and spring breaks. Hiring Process Hiring an F-1 or J-1 international student will be the same as hiring any other student with a few exceptions. The student may not have a social security number yet The student will not be eligible for work study The student may be exempt from the criminal background check process. Social Security Numbers F-1 and J-1 students become eligible for an SSN when they receive an offer of employment. If this is the student’s first job, then they will need to apply for their SSN. They will require an employment letter from you on departmental letterhead in order to do so. The SSN application process should take about 2 weeks. The student may begin working without the SSN as long as a criminal background check is not required. Download a template for the employment letter» Criminal Background Checks According to IU Human Resources policy , criminal background checks are only required for foreign nationals who have been present in the United States for more than one year. If a background check is required, then you will need to wait for the student to obtain an SSN before conducting the background check. Completing the I-9 Filling out the I-9 for international students is different from American hires. You will need a copy of the student’s I-20 (F-1 students) or DS-2019 (J-1 student) to fill out the form. Any questions about how to fill out the various fields on the I-9 should be directed to Human Resources staff .

Click here for a detailed flowchart of the hiring process. To request J-1 status or J-1 extension for the scholar the hiring department at IUPUI must submit an electronic request (e-form) through Atlas . J-1 Visa, What to Consider? Is our department prepared to support a J-1 visa? A faculty member who is inviting a J-1 scholar to come will need to consider these issues: Is there a natural fit to the interests of the scholar and the department? Do the scholar's research goals fit well with those of the existing faculty or does it offer a direction of interest to the department? Are faculty available to spend time with the scholar familiarizing him/her with the campus and contributing to his/her research interests? Are there other staff — postdocs, graduate students who will contribute to the scholar's experience or are the expectations solely based on the faculty's role as a mentor? Does the scholar have requisite language skills? How has this been confirmed? Consider minimally a Zoom interview. Is there a work station available? Is there a computer available? Are staff willing to collect and coordinate supporting visa paperwork for the scholar with OIA? Most scholars coming for a short-term program sponsored by IUPUI will come on the J-1 visa. It is necessary to initiate an \"Add a New Person\" edoc so that a University ID number is generated which we will use in creating the supporting visa documents. OIA will charge the department $190 /year of stay for the visa processing. Is there sufficient financial support for the scholar? For the J-1 visa USCIS requires sufficient proof of funding. OIA will ask for proof of at least $1,310 /month of stay when processing the visa documents. Are there dependents who will be coming? Is there sufficient financial support for them? The minimum requirement is $8000/year for the first dependent; $6750/year for every successive dependent. The scholar must have health insurance. The OIA can assist the scholar in enrolling but it costs about $150/month of stay. It can be pro-rated to exactly the amount of time the scholar will be visiting. USCIS requires that OIA maintain proof that the scholar is adequately insured. The scholar will need housing both temporarily when they first arrive and long-term. The OIA usually recommend that the department only reserve long-term housing if they plan to pay for it. If the scholar is expected to pay for it, it is difficult to assess in advance what trade-off between price, amenities, and location they will prefer as we cannot know their point of reference. Based on where they live, they will need transportation and will have to assess these costs. The minimum monthly financial support of $1,310 considers this cost but is arranged for bus transportation. An administrator within the department can arrange university e-mail and internet access. However it does require completing the hire process even if it is an academic no-pay position. The scholar may need support during the initial arrival period with airport pick-up, assistance in finding housing, accessing a computer, and enrolling any school-age children in local schools. Unless they have other contacts at the university, they will usually look to their faculty mentor for support. Time Frame to process a J-1 Visa Request Once a department provides all request forms and supplementary materials, OIA can generally process the DS-2019 and supporting materials in about 2 weeks. For positions in the School of Engineering & Technology or the School of Medicine, the process can take an additional 1-2 weeks. Documenting English Language Proficiency New J-1 regulations effective January 5, 2015 require all J-1 program sponsors to document objective evidence of English proficiency.  To assist departments in this process we offer the chart below to help you evaluate the proficiency level of your J-1 scholar and the implications for working in your department. J-1 English Proficiency Evaluation Grid Type of English User CEFR Level Description of Abilities Test Score Estimates Notes for Hosting Departments Proficient User C1/C2 Can express him/herself fluently and spontaneously without much obvious searching for expressions. Can use language flexibly and effectively for social, academic and professional purposes. Can produce clear, well-structured, detailed text on complex subjects.  Occasional inappropriate usage. TOEFL iBT 110+ IELTS   8.0+ Proficient users can be expected to be fully functional and able to benefit from all offered aspects of the exchange visitor program. Independent/ Competent User B2 Can understand the main ideas of complex text on both concrete and abstract topics, including technical discussions in his/her field of specialization. Can interact with a degree of fluency and spontaneity that makes regular interaction with native speakers quite possible without strain for either party. Generally handles complex language well and understands detailed reasoning. TOEFL iBT  79-109 IELTS  6.5-7.5 A person at this level can generally be successful in most academic program contexts, unless the program demands a particularly high level of proficiency. Modest User B1 Can understand the main points of standard language on familiar matters regularly encountered in work, school, leisure, etc. Can deal with most situations likely to arise whilst travelling in an area where the language is spoken.  Should be able to handle basic communication within the scholar’s own field. TOEFL     60-78 IELTS      5.5 - 6.0 A person at this level will be able to manage day-to-day living quite independently (after some initial assistance), but is likely to encounter some challenges in communicating fully in an English academic context. Basic/Limited User A2 Can understand sentences and frequently used expressions related to areas of most immediate relevance (e.g. very basic personal and family information, shopping, local geography, employment). Can communicate in simple and routine tasks requiring a simple and direct exchange of information on familiar and routine matters. Frequent mistakes. Use interview and/or recommendation letter to determine communication ability; TOEFL/IELTS scores lower than the thresholds given above will not likely be useful to determine ability to function in an academic environment. A person at this level will be able to manage day-to-day living after an initial orientation period, but will have significant limitations participating fully in an English-speaking academic environment. Extremely Limited User A1 Can introduce him/herself and others and can ask and answer questions about personal details such as where he/she lives, people he/she knows and things he/she has. Can interact in a simple way provided the other person talks slowly and clearly and is prepared to help. A person at this level cannot be expected to handle routine matters independently in an English-speaking environment. The host department will need to arrange support personnel for the duration of the exchange visitor program. Description derived  from Common European Framework Reference (CEFR) levels and IELTS Band Descriptors.  Further information about standardized English proficiency examinations is available at http://www.ets.org/toefl and http://www.ielts.org/ You will note on the J-1 request e-form that we ask you to indicate how you evaluated the English language proficiency of your J-1 scholar and to provide us with supporting documentation.

The F-1 student will need to confirm with a Designated School Official (DSO) at the home institution regarding STEM OPT extension eligibility. Students whose 17-month STEM OPT extension expires prior to May 10, 2016, or who have less than 150 days remaining on their 17-month STEM OPT extension EADs as of May 9, 2016 are not eligible for an additional STEM OPT extension. More information on STEM OPT can be found on the Study in the States Stem OPT Hub . You can learn more about the student’s responsibilities on our website . STEM OPT Reporting Requirements for Employers If you employ a student applying for a STEM OPT extension, you play a key role in maintaining and strengthening the integrity of the STEM OPT extension program. Although compliance with the program’s various reporting requirements predominately apply to the F-1 student and the DSO at the home institution, there are instances where you need to assist in tracking the STEM OPT students and their practical training progress. Complete and Certify the Form I-983 Work with the student to complete the Form I-983, specifically Sections 3 - 6. The form is not complete until the your department has signed and certified it in the designated areas. Evaluation of Student Progress The student is responsible for conducting an annual self-evaluation on their own progress, and you need to review this evaluation and sign it to attest to its accuracy. The student must submit the first assessment within 12 months of the OPT STEM start date, and a second, final assessment that recaps the training and knowledge acquired during the complete training period. The student must submit evaluations to the DSO no later than 10 days following the conclusion of the applicable reporting period. Report Material Changes to an Existing Form I-983 Work with the STEM OPT student to report to the DSO at the student’s home institution any material changes to, or material deviations from, the student’s formal training plan, by filling out a new Form I-983. Material changes or deviations from the original Form I-983 may include, but are not limited to: Any change of Employer Identification Number resulting from a corporate restructuring. Any reduction in student compensation that is not tied to a reduction in hours worked. Any significant decrease in hours per week that a student engages in a STEM training opportunity. Changes to the employer’s commitments or student’s learning objectives as documented on the Form I-983. Report End of Employment You and the student must notify the DSO at the home institution when the student’s employment is terminated for any reason before the end of the authorized extension period. Report such a change in employment to the appropriate DSO no later than five business days after the student’s employment terminates or the student has departed employment. You can report the information with an email to the DSO indicating that the student was terminated or has otherwise departed, as well as the applicable date of such termination or departure. Guidance on Employer Completion of Form I-983 The STEM OPT student will obtain the Form I-983 and is responsible for returning the completed and signed form to their DSO. You are responsible for completing Sections 3 to 6 of the I-983 and must provide a signature on the student’s annual self-evaluation.

Please visit the FMS website to understand more about the supporting documentation and tax requirements of compensating short-term visitors: In general, if a visitor to IUPUI can only have reduced tax withholding if they are eligible for a tax treaty benefit. They can only obtain treaty benefits through applying for a Social Security Number (SSN) or Individual Taxpayer ID Number (ITIN). If the visitor will be taxed (and generally it will be at the 30% rate), the department will want to consider increasing their payment to the visitor to offset this reduction in the amount of their financial support from IUPUI.

Apply inside the United States for a change of status. Leave the United States and apply for a new visa stamp at a U.S. embassy. Before you apply for a change to F-1 status, make an appointment with an OIA advisor by calling 317-274-7000. Your advisor will go over your eligibility and will thoroughly describe the application process to help you make the best decision for your situation. Apply for F-1 Status from Inside the United States Those students in J-1 status and subject to the 212e home residency requirement are not eligible for this option. Additionally, there are issues with timing for the application. Speak with an OIA immigration advisor to go over all the risks of this application before you file. It is possible that this is not a good option for your situation. Approval or denial of your Change of Status application can take up to nine months. It is critical that you start the application process well in advance of the start of your new program. Timing is especially critical if you will have funding from your department that will require you to work on campus in your first semester. Current processing times can be found by going to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website . You will need to provide OIA with: Financial documentation less than 6 months old A copy of your passport identity page A copy of your most recent I-94 entry record Copies of immigration documents for any dependent on your record If you are the dependent of anyone else's record, copies of their immigration documents Your application to the USCIS will contain the following documents: Form I-539 A check or money order for $370 (form filing fee) and $85 (biometric fee, this is for each individual on the change of status application, so if you are filing with dependents you need to multiply the fee by the total number of applicants) made out to USCIS Copies of: Your new I-20, issued by your OIA advisor Your admission letter from the Office of International Affairs Financial documents showing funding for at least one academic year ( Learn more about estimated expenses ) Your most recent I-94 entry record A copy of your passport identity page Documentation that you have been maintaining your current visa status (your OIA advisor will help you determine what this will be) Your SEVIS I-901 fee receipt Please be aware that change of status process results in F-1 status, but an F-1 visa stamp is not issued. Visa stamps may only be issued overseas at a U.S. consulate or embassy. F-1 status allows you to stay legally in the U.S., but you will need to obtain an F-1 visa stamp if you leave the U.S. and intend to re-enter. Getting F-1 Status from Outside the United States An OIA advisor will be able to help you determine if you are eligible to change your status via travel. With this option, you will need to submit the following to us: Updated financial documentation , less than 12 months old A copy of your passport identity page (and those of any dependent you will have) Once you have submitted the appropriate documentation, an OIA advisor will create an I-20 for you and your dependents. After you have obtained your I-20, you will need to apply for an F-1 visa stamp at a U.S. consulate or embassy . Learn more about applying for a visa in the F-1 student section . You can also refer to the U.S. Department of State’s website on information for non-immigrants present in the United States, and visiting Canada or Mexico .

There are four steps in the process. If you are a Canadian citizen with a valid passport, you do not need to apply for a visa stamp. However, you do need to pay the SEVIS fee before arriving at the port of entry. Step One: Pay Your SEVIS Fee You will have to show your payment receipt for the SEVIS fee when you arrive for your visa interview, so pay the fee right away. (If you paid the fee in the past, you may not need to pay it again, but you should still bring your receipt.) Learn more about the SEVIS fee and how to pay it and obtain your payment receipt. Step Two: Schedule a Visa Appointment at the U.S. Embassy in Your Home Country Contact the U.S. embassy/consulate nearest you as soon as possible to set up an appointment. This is important because the wait time for an appointment and for visa issuance varies. To see how long this process takes in your country, read the U.S. Department of State's visa wait time information . It’s best to apply in your home country. If you are not sure which embassy/consulate you should contact, see this list of U.S. embassies . Step Three: Get Your Documentation Ready When you arrive for your visa appointment, you will be required to show a number of documents, including: I-20 Valid passport A SEVIS payment receipt printed from your online payment confirmation Visa application forms Current financial documentation that lists the sources and amounts of financial support you have secured for the current or upcoming academic year. It must match the information listed on your I-20 Students renewing their visa should also bring: A Letter of Good Standing, which may be requested through Atlas A copy of your unofficial transcript, printed out from One.iu.edu (search for \"Unofficial Transcript\") A copy of the EAD card and proof of employment (Students on OPT only) Step Four: Prepare for Your Interview Since you are applying for a nonimmigrant visa, you will need to prove to the consular officer that you do not intend to immigrate to the United States. In other words, you need to show him or her that you have definite plans to return home after college. For more information and tips, please see NAFSA's Ten Points to Remember . Applying for a Visa in a Third Country Applying for visa in a country which is not your home country or the U.S., called a “third” country, can be more difficult than applying at home. You should have a valid reason for applying in the country where the consulate is located; you are likely to be denied if your only reason for applying in that country is to avoid your home country consulate. Examples of valid reasons could include to attend a conference, to visit family or friends, etc. Additionally, you may need to prove that you have continuously maintained lawful non-immigrant status during your time in the U.S. or you may be sent to your home country to apply for the visa. Refusal in a third country is more likely than at home, so you should plan well in advance of your date of travel. Applying for a Visa in Canada or Mexico The U.S. Department of State provides specific guidance on applying for a visa in Canada or Mexico. If you intend to apply for a new U.S. visa in either country and are not a citizen or resident of either country, it is important for you to contact an advisor at the Office of International Affairs if you have further questions.

Do I Need to Renew My Visa Stamp? It is important to remember there is a distinction made between your F-1 visa stamp and your F-1 visa status . F-1 students are admitted to the United States for the duration of their status, not for a specific amount of time. This is why an F-1 student's I-94 \"admit until\" date should read \"D/S.\" If an F-1 student is maintaining their status in the United States they do not need to renew their visa stamp to stay in the U.S. This means you may remain even after your visa stamp expiration date if you are maintaining your F-1 status. Find out more about maintaining your F-1 status on our website . If your visa stamp has expired and you travel outside of the U.S. you will need to renew your visa to re-enter the U.S. in F-1 status. Steps to Renew Your Visa Stamp Step One: Schedule a Visa Appointment at the U.S. Embassy in Your Home Country You may only renew your F-1 visa at a U.S. embassy or consular office outside of the United States. Contact the U.S. embassy/consulate, generally in your home country, to set up an appointment. The wait time for an appointment and for visa issuance varies.

Renewing Your Visa Stamp on OPT Generally, it can be more difficult to renew your F-1 visa stamp while on OPT. OIA would not recommend attempting to renew your F-1 visa stamp while on OPT if you are not currently employed. Please feel free to contact an advisor at the Office of International Affairs if you have questions.

You may have noticed this question on the U.S. nonimmigrant visa application form. It is not a pleasant topic to discuss, but if you ever find yourself involved with the authorities, you need to be aware of the potential impact it may have on your next visa application. It is very important that you answer this question honestly. If you have been arrested, you should contact an attorney for assistance. The information on this page is very general and should not be considered a substitute for advice from a qualified legal professional about your individual situation. You will find a link to some immigration attorneys below. When am I required to answer “yes”? It is important to answer “yes” to this question if you were ever arrested or convicted of a crime, even if the charges were dropped or you were acquitted. You will have an opportunity to provide additional details about the arrest and the outcome. How do I know if I was officially arrested? If you are arrested by the police in the U.S., the officer must recite your “Miranda rights” to you. You’ve probably heard these on U.S. television shows. They include the lines “You have the right to remain silent,” and “You have the right to consult an attorney.” Is being arrested the same as being charged with a crime? No. Normally a person is charged with a crime after being arrested. This is a formal process during which you’ll be shown an indictment (the offense with which you are being charged) and the court officer will explain what law/s you have violated. It is possible to be arrested and released without ever being charged. If this happens, you must still answer “yes” on the visa application question. How do I know if I have been convicted? If you are never charged with a crime, you cannot be convicted.  If you are charged with a crime, but the charges were dropped, you cannot be convicted unless new charges are filed later.  If you are brought before a court and plead guilty or are found guilty, then you have been convicted. If you ever find yourself charged with a crime, we recommend that you find two attorneys--one that specializes in immigration law and one that specializes in criminal law.  Without the guidance of the immigration attorney, a criminal attorney may not understand the legal impact of his or her advice on your visa status.  It is important to have the right kind of attorney to help you understand the court proceedings and what they mean for your individual situation. Will an arrest or conviction prevent me from getting a visa in the future? Visas are granted at the discretion of the individual visa officer. Depending on the severity of the crime, a conviction may make it difficult or impossible for you to get a visa to enter the U.S. For advice about your specific case, you will need to contact an immigration attorney. Will an arrest or conviction cause me to lose my visa status while in the U.S.? IUPUI is required by regulation to report, within 21 days, “any disciplinary action taken by the school against the student as a result of the student being convicted of a crime.” This reporting action by itself does not automatically result in a termination of status. However, the information will be available to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, who will determine whether additional action is warranted. Additionally, if the disciplinary action is suspension or expulsion, this may result in a loss of status for not maintaining full-time enrollment. An arrest or conviction that does not result in a disciplinary action by IUPUI may still be reported by law enforcement officials to ICE; in which case, ICE officials would have the same discretion to determine whether additional action is warranted. Will embassy staff know if I have had an arrest or conviction if I do not provide that information on the visa application? Yes, they will most likely have access to this information through other sources. You should never give a false answer to this question on the visa application or in the visa interview. Providing false information on a visa application or during an interview could result in a finding of fraud. A finding of fraud could result in a permanent bar from entering the U.S. Can an arrest or conviction affect any other types of immigration applications? You should assume that any application you file for an immigration benefit will involve a check for any arrest or criminal history. Extensive databases are maintained at the national level and are available to immigration authorities. You should consult with an immigration attorney about any history of arrest or conviction that may be of concern. Is it possible my visa is already cancelled? Yes. It is possible that your current U.S. visa stamp could be cancelled, especially if you have a \"Driving Under the Influence\" (DUI) or \"Driving While Intoxicated\" (DWI) arrest or conviction. Please note, even if you aren't arrested, it is possible this information is available to the U.S. Consulate abroad and they may cancel your valid visa stamp currently on file. This could prevent you from re-entering the U.S. after travel abroad and/or successfully applying for a new visa stamp in the future. Will the Department of Homeland Security contact me if my visa is cancelled? Possibly, but maybe not. We have had reports that email or telephone communications are being used as soon as a few days after an arrest or conviction informing non-immigrants that their visa has been cancelled. What does it mean if my visa is cancelled? Typically, if your visa stamp itself has been cancelled but your status remains valid and unexpired, a visa cancellation does not disrupt your period of stay in the U.S. unless you leave the U.S. If you depart the U.S., you must reapply for a new visa stamp. If you have drug or alcohol related arrests/convictions, you could be referred to a Panel Physician in your home country (or country of application) for evaluation during your visa interview. This physician will  make a determinationon if you are an \"abuser or addict\" and/or if you present a danger to yourself or others. It is possible that you can be required to stay at home for a year or more seeking treatment in order to be considered for another visa stamp. You should only travel if you understand and are willing to risk not being able to return to the U.S. for an extended period of time.  You may also want to retain an immigration attorney with details specific to your case. If you determine you need to consult with an immigration attorney, we recommend searching for an immigration attorney affiliated with the American Immigration Lawyers Association , or AILA. AILA is a national association of attorneys and law professors who practice and teach immigration law. In addition, you can review the American Civil Liberties Union , or ACLU's brochure describing how to \" Know Your Rights When Encountering Law Enforcement .\" Academic Advisor Resources Departmental Hiring & Hosting F-1 Students Applying for a Visa Employment SEVIS Violations Full-Time Enrollment Maintaining Status Dependents of F-1 Students Completing Your Program I-20 Extensions Local Address SEVIS Fee F-1 SEVIS Transfer from IUPUI Travel Outside the U.S. H-1B Specialty Workers J-1 Scholars J-1 Students Permanent Residence Taxes & Social Security Numbers DACA and Undocumented Student Information Immigration Updates Office of International Affairs social media channels Twitter Facebook Instagram YouTube Copyright © 2023 The Trustees of Indiana University , Copyright Complaints Accessibility | Privacy Notice"

As you get ready to complete your program of study, you can: Apply for Optional Practical Training (OPT) so you can work in the United States. Applications for OPT can be submitted up to 90 days before your completion date and must be received by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) no later than 60 days after the completion of your academic program requirements. Apply for a change of status if applicable. USCIS must receive the application before the end of your 60-day grace period. You should also consider working with an attorney as \"Bridge applications\" might be necessary if your F-1 status will end prior to the approval or start of your new status. Transfer to a new school. You must request a “ Transfer Out ” of your SEVIS record via Atlas . You will need to have your transfer out approved by the Office of International Affairs before the end of your 60-day grace period. Start a new program of study at IUPUI. You must be fully admitted and have received a new I-20 from the Office of International Affairs before the end of the 60-day grace period. Updated financial documentation will be required. You can make your request for a New Degree Program via Atlas . Leave the United States before the end of your grace period. Program Completion and Your F-1 Status If you are an undergraduate student, or a graduate student in a coursework-only program, your completion date will be the last day of final exams during the term in which you complete your degree requirements. If you are a graduate student writing a thesis or dissertation, your completion date will be either: The last day of final exams in the last semester or summer term of your enrollment when you are submitting your thesis or dissertation; or The last day of the month if you are in an Indiana University-based degree program that allows monthly thesis or dissertation deposits and does monthly conferrals and you are submitting your thesis or dissertation earlier than the last month of the semester or summer term. If you wish to apply for post-completion OPT prior to the final submission of your thesis or dissertation, your program completion date can be earlier to accommodate this, as long as you have completed all of your required coursework toward your graduate program. For detailed information on Optional Practical Training click here . If you are a graduate student in a program with a required cumulative examination that is required for degree completion/conferral, your completion date would be the day of that required cumulative examination. Please note: incomplete courses do not extend your program completion to a new semester. If you have incomplete courses in your final semester, or are concerned you might have incomplete courses, please contact OIA immediately for assistance. Your eligibility to work on campus ends upon completion of your program of study. Your Post-Completion Grace Period Federal regulations provide you with a 60-day grace period that starts the day you complete your program of study. For example, if you complete your program of study on May 4, your grace period ends on July 3 regardless of the expiration date on your I-20. If you have not made other plans, you must depart the country by the end of your grace period. Travel After Completing your Program If you plan to travel to Canada or anywhere else outside of the United States during your grace period, the OIA will not be able to sign your I-20 for travel. If you travel outside of the country after completing your academic program, you will NOT be able to re-enter the United States as an F-1 student. You may be able to re-enter the United States as a tourist. Discuss your plans before you travel; see an advisor during Walk-in Advising Hours . Dependent Status after Completing Your Program If you have F-2 dependents with you in the United States, their status is dependent upon yours. If you choose to leave the country after you complete your program of study, your family members may not legally stay in the United States without you if they hold F-2 status. If you extend your stay with OPT, the status of your dependents is extended as well. Departure Checklists University Obligations If you received any wages from IUPUI during the previous year, be sure to inform the human resources administrator in your department of your plans for departure. Update One.iu.edu with your new mailing address, phone number, and email address. Return any borrowed books or other materials to the library. Pay any remaining balance on your bursar account in One.iu.edu . Your diploma and official transcripts will not be released until your balance is fully paid. Immigration Obligations Organize a file with copies of all visa and immigration documents pertaining to your stay in the U.S. so that you can access them again in the future. Examples of visa documents include: passport, visa, I-94, I-20 forms, DS-2019 forms, I-797 approval notices, and EAD cards. OIA does not archive copies of documents for more than 5 years beyond your departure. If you have a child who was born in the U.S., visit the State Department website here how to get a U.S. passport for your child. Your child will need a U.S. passport to return to the U.S. in the future. If you have a small, white paper I-94 card, when you depart the U.S. , be sure to turn in that I-94 card. Usually, it will be collected by an airline official. Failure to submit this card upon your exit may result in future travel difficulties. If you have an electronic I-94, then you do not need to take any special actions. Financial Obligations If you received wages from IUPUI or another employer during the calendar year, you will need to file a tax return the following spring. You will need to obtain your W-2 form from your employer. This form contains the data that you will use to complete a U.S. tax return. Please remember that even though you are not in the U.S., you are required to file a tax return on all U.S.-based income. This becomes especially important if you owe the U.S. government taxes. This debt will keep accruing interest until it is addressed. OIA can give you general information on filing individual tax returns . Notify your bank of your departure plans. If you have been working or have scheduled payments from your bank account, determine if you will need to leave your account open beyond your departure date to allow for pending transactions. Work with the bank to determine the best way to handle the closure of your account or options for maintaining a U.S. account indefinitely after you relocate abroad. Determine if you have any outstanding bills with credit card companies, auto or renter's insurance companies, or other organizations. If you are unable to pay them off before departing, contact the organization to make arrangements for payment. Health Insurance If you have been covered under the IUPUI mandatory Aetna insurance policy for international students, the Indiana University Health Insurance Representative at studenhc@indiana.edu can verify your coverage end date and advise you on extension options. If you hold insurance from another source, contact the program administrator for that insurance program directly for assistance. Housing & Related Issues Notify your landlord of your intended departure date. (Check your lease to determine how much advance notice is required and if there are any penalties for leaving before your lease is finished.) Ask if there are any procedures that you must follow. Make arrangements for the return of any refundable deposit. Notify your utility companies (phone, gas, electricity, water, cable, internet, etc.) of your departure date. If you paid any deposits when you set up the service, ask if you can get that money returned. Make arrangements for paying your final bills. Consider donating or selling your household goods. You can donate items to organizations such as Goodwill or AMVETS . You can sell them via the classified ads on OneStart or on craigslist.com. If you would like to give the items to new students, please contact OIA to learn if we are collecting items at that time. Miscellaneous Request official transcripts from the Registrar’s Office . You may wish to purchase several to avoid having to order them again from overseas. If you will not receive your diploma before your departure date, contact your department to arrange for it to be mailed to you. Learn about alumni email accounts . If you have obtained a Social Security Number (SSN), keep your card! Your SSN will remain valid for the rest of your life. If you return to the U.S. at some point in the future, you will continue to use the same number. If you lose your card, you can only apply for a new one during a future visit if you are in a visa status that permits employment in the U.S. Fill out a \"change of address\" form at the post office. (The online form does not accommodate international addresses.) Please note any U.S. immigration document will not be forwarded. Inform immigration of a reliable U.S. address if you have a case pending.

The F-2 visa is for a dependent spouse or an unmarried child who is under the age of 21. F-2 status enables dependents to stay in the United States during the F-1 student’s program. Funding Documentation F-1 students must prove that they have financial support to fund their dependents in F-2 status. You should be prepared to document funding for each dependent, funding amounts can be found on our Tuition & Fees page (see financial information or estimated expenses document for graduate or undergraduate students for current amounts). Requesting F-2 Dependent Documents Dependent documents can be requested in two ways: as part of the admissions process or once the F-1 student has arrived to the US. If you plan to bring your family with you at the beginning of your study, you should submit your dependent documents and funding as part of your admission process. If you plan to bring your dependents to the United States after you have already begun your study, you will need to request documents from your Atlas account. To request documents for your dependent complete the Dependent Document Request located in your Atlas F-1 Student Services menu. Complete this eForm with your Dependent’s information. You will need to attach copies of new financial documentation, your dependent’s passport ID page, and proof of your relationship (marriage or birth certificate). Once this is received by OIA, we will begin processing your request for documents and notify you when they are ready for pickup. Other topics of interest for F-2 dependents: Travel Outside the United States Dependents follow the same travel procedures as students. See F-1 Travel guidance » Enrollment in IUPUI Courses F-2 Dependents are able to study at IUPUI part-time. This means that they must remain enrolled in 11 or less credits for an undergraduate program or 7 or less credits if enrolled in a graduate program. They may complete the entire degree program as long as the F-2 stays enrolled part-time. NOTE: if the program is completed in F-2 status, the F-2 dependent will not qualify for any work authorization at any point. School-age children (up to 18) can study in primary and high school in the United States. Work authorization F-2 Dependents are not eligible to work in the United States. Dependent Remaining Here While F-1 Travels An F-1 student must maintain his or her status in order for the F-2 dependent to stay in the United States. If the F-1 student is out of the country for a significant period of time, this might affect the F-2’s ability to remain in the United States. Contact us for help with your specific situation.

The cap-gap extension applies to all F-1 students on OPT whose non-college or university employers filed a timely H-1B petition for the following fiscal year, regardless of your field of study. If your employer files a timely H-1B petition (requesting a change of status within the United States and an employment start date of October 1 of the following fiscal year) before your current OPT authorization expires, you are permitted to continue working and may remain legally in the United States in F-1 status until the H-1B petition is approved, rejected, denied, or revoked. The allowance of extra time while the petition is being reviewed is known as \"cap-gap authorization.\" This permission to remain in the United States in F-1 status and continue working under OPT in this particular situation is automatic. There is no new application for an EAD. If the H-1B petition is approved, your immigration status change will occur on October 1. If the H-1B petition is rejected, denied, or revoked, your OPT cap-gap authorization will end 10 days after its rejection, and you will have a 60-day grace period to depart the country, change status, or begin a new program (at the same school or by transferring to a new school). The cap-gap work authorization continuation only applies in cases where the H-1B petition is filed before the EAD expires. If the EAD expires before the H-1B petition can be filed, but you are still within the 60-day grace period, you may remain in the United States in F-1 status until a decision on the H-1B petition is reached, but may not be employed. F-2 dependents (spouses and unmarried minor children) are eligible to remain in F-2 status during this time as well. If your employer's attorney, your local BMV, or a similar party requests that you provide an updated I-20 that reflects your cap-gap OPT, please email us at iadvisor@iupui.edu to request the I-20. Is Your Employer Interested In Sponsoring You for an H-1B but Doesn't Know Where to Start? IUPUI has a program called Immigration Bridge.

If you have a paid or unpaid employment opportunity that will give you experience in your field of study before you graduate, such as an internship, you may be eligible for a type of work authorization called Curricular Practical Training (CPT). CPT work must be an integral part of your curriculum; therefore, it must be done for credit that counts towards your degree requirements. Your CPT authorization must be issued by the Office of International Affairs before you start working, and you may not work before or after your CPT authorized dates. Working without authorization is a violation of your legal status in the U.S. Additionally, you may not “volunteer” at the workplace before your CPT is approved. This would still be considered a violation of your F-1 status. CPT Eligibility To apply for CPT, F-1 students must meet all of the requirements below. 1. Be Eligible for CPT To be eligible for CPT, you must be in F-1 status and have been a full-time student for at least one full academic year (one fall and one spring semester). Talk to an international student advisor if you have questions regarding this requirement. Eligibility due to COVID-19 The U.S. government has not updated the regulations related to Curricular Practical Training (CPT) and Optional Practical Training (OPT) due to COVID-19. The U.S. government requires that you to be in person in the U.S. for 30 weeks of classroom instruction before you are eligible. Only weeks that you have been physically present in the United States count towards the 30-week requirement. Here are some examples to make this requirement clearer: If you arrived in the U.S. on August 12, 2022, and enrolled in classes that met August 23, 2022-December 16, 2022, you have 16 weeks of instruction. Note that the time you were in the U.S. before classes started do not count. To be eligible for CPT you would need to complete at least another 14 weeks of instruction (13 week courses would not be enough). If you were enrolled in classes that met August 23, 2022-December 16, 2022, but participated online until you arrived in the U.S. on September 9, 2022, you have accumulated only 14 weeks of instruction. Note that the time you were enrolled in class outside the U.S. does not count. To be eligible for CPT in summer 2023, you would also need to complete 16 weeks of classroom instruction in spring 2023. 2. Enroll in a CPT-Appropriate Course You must register in an appropriate course during the semester in which your internship will take place as part of the CPT process. This course must count towards degree requirements for your major field of study and work authorization must be necessary to complete course objectives. Speak with your academic advisor to determine your options for a CPT-appropriate course. Your advisor should consult directly with the OIA on any questions. You must be registered for an appropriate course before you may complete a CPT request. CPT eligible course options will be in one of three categories: an optional or required internship or practicum course in your academic program. Registration in an internship or practicum course is required, and that course must count towards your degree requirements. a regular course or independent study course in your academic program that would require work authorization to complete course objectives. Registration in the course is required, and that course must count towards your degree requirements. Graduate students only: The work benefits your thesis/dissertation/final project in a material and substantial way . Registration for thesis/dissertation/final project credit(s) is required. 3. Have an Offer of Employment You must submit an offer letter on company letterhead from your prospective employer. Please share a copy of the offer letter with your academic advisor, because he or she will need to verify that the employment will fulfill the requirements of your CPT course. The letter must include: The specific start date and specific end date for employment The number of hours you will work per week. It is not sufficient for the letter to state \"part time\" or \"full time.\" The physical location (street address, city, state, and ZIP code) where the job will be conducted. P.O. boxes are not accepted for this requirement. A detailed description of the job duties of the offered employment Your request cannot be approved if your offer letter does not include all items above. CPT Application Process To apply for CPT, complete the e-form request in Atlas under F-1 Practical Training. In the e-form, you will provide the following documentation. Proof of course enrollment (recommend this be a copy of your unofficial transcript) Job Offer letter that meets all requirements above (your request cannot be approved if any items are missing) Your academic advisors name and contact information Details of the proposed internship Maintain Your F-1 Status While on CPT Follow these rules to maintain your F-1 status: Make good academic progress! Remember that CPT usage may not delay graduation. Do not drop the course that your CPT is based on. Doing so would immediately cancel your CPT, making your employment illegal. If you are authorized for part-time CPT, work no more than 20 hours/week. If your CPT is during a Fall or Spring semester, you must still enroll full-time. If you are authorized for full-time CPT, you are expected to work more than 20 hours/week, and you are only required to enroll in your CPT course. Additional registration is optional, however students must continue to make good academic progress. Frequently Asked Questions Do I need CPT for an unpaid internship? Yes, you are required to apply for CPT, even for an unpaid work experience. This rule is designed to protect you, the employer, and other workers. Will my CPT affect my eligibility for Optional Practical Training upon graduation? Part-time CPT never affects your eligibility for OPT. However, full-time CPT of 12 months or more causes you to lose your OPT eligibility entirely. Learn more about OPT » Can I qualify for an extension of my CPT? CPT can only be extended if the continued employment is necessary to meet the requirements of your CPT-related course. It is not allowable in cases where the employer or the student wish for the employment to continue, but there is no academic basis for the extension. In most cases, you will be asked to apply for CPT again, and register for an additional course during the CPT extension period. Remember that students must continue to make good academic progress; a desire to participate in multiple instances of CPT would not be a valid reason to extend ones program. Consult with an OIA advisor if you have questions regarding CPT extensions. I already have on-campus employment. Can I be authorized for additional, off-campus employment through CPT? If you hold a current position on campus (hourly or as a graduate assistant, etc.) and you wish to accept additional employment or unpaid training in your field of study, you may be eligible for this benefit. Without CPT, you are only eligible for a total of 20 hours per week of on-campus work (excluding university breaks). If you wish to (1) work more than 20 hours per week, or (2) work or unpaid training off-campus, CPT authorization is required. Please contact our office to schedule an appointment with an international student advisor to discuss your options. Can I qualify for CPT in my first semester? Normally you must complete an entire academic year of full-time study before you can qualify. However, there is an exception for graduate students in cases where an internship or practicum experience is required in the first semester. This situation is extremely rare. OIA does not consider CPT applications for new students who wish to continue their employment after their Optional Practical Training or other employment authorization has expired. CPT is available only when the employment opportunity is academically driven and an integral part of your degree program. Don’t qualify for CPT, but don’t want to lose a job opportunity? Consider using part of your Optional Practical Training (OPT) during your degree program.

OIA must have a Form I-983 Training Plan from you before we can create an I-20 recommending the 24-month STEM extension. Form I-983 and instructions can be found here . We understand that completing the Form I-983 can be confusing. We first suggest reviewing the Study in the States tutorial on completing the Form I-983 found above; this information is provided directly by Department of Homeland Security, or DHS. Additionally, we have gathered some other commonly asked questions for your review: Section 1: Student Information This section should be completed by the student: this section gathers information primarily about you. Student Name (Surname/Primary Name, Given Name): We suggest writing your surname in all CAPS, then your Given Name with normal punctuation, for example: SMITH, John. Student Email Address: Use an email address you check frequently. This could be your IUPUI address or another email such as Gmail or Yahoo. Name of School Recommending STEM OPT: Indiana U Purdue U Indianapolis Name of School Where STEM Degree Was Earned: If you are applying based on your current degree from IUPUI, use: Indiana U Purdue U Indianapolis. If you are applying based on a previous degree, use the name of your school found in the \"School Information\" section of your I-20 from that degree. SEVIS School Code of School Recommending STEM OPT (including 3 digit suffix): If you are applying based on your current degree from IUPUI, use: CHI214F10103008. If you are applying based on a previous degree, use the name of your school found in the \"School Information\" section of your I-20 from that degree. Designated School Official (DSO) Name and Contact Information: Aliza Frame, iadvisor@iupui.edu , 317-274-7000 Student SEVIS ID No: This can be found on the top left corner of your I-20. This number begins with the letter N followed by 10 numerical digits, for example: N0000000000 STEM OPT Requested Period: This should be the 24 month period immediately following your OPT. If your 12 month OPT ends on January 1, 2020, your dates should be: 01/02/2020 - 01/01/2022. Qualifying Major and Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) Code: This can be found on your I-20 in the Program of Study section. Under Major 1, indicate the 6 digit code after your major. This will be in the format of 00.0000. Level/Type of Qualifying Degree: Enter the level of the degree that qualifies you for the STEM OPT. Select from: bachelors, masters, or doctorate level. Date Awarded: This can be found on your unofficial transcript, this should be the date that your qualifying degree was awarded. If you have completed all of your coursework but are continuing to work on a thesis/dissertation that would qualify you for the STEM OPT extension, enter the date when the degree is expected to be awarded and specify that it is the expected date. Based on Prior Degree: Check “Yes” if your STEM OPT participation is based on a previously‐obtained STEM degree, and is not the same degree upon which your current post‐completion OPT was granted. Check “No” if your STEM OPT participation is based on your most recently obtained degree, and that is the degree upon which your current post‐completion OPT is based. Employment Authorization Number: This can be found on your current EAD, list the USCIS #, it should be in the format: 000-000-000 Section 2: Student Certification ﻿This section should be completed by the student. Review the paragraph under \"I certify that:\" Once you have read the paragraph: sign your name, date, and print your name legibily. Section 3: Employer Information The employer should complete this section. Information contained in this section includes: Employer Information including name, address, website URL. This information should all be self explanatory. Employer ID Number (EIN): This should be the employer's IRS tax identification number. Employers without an EIN cannot employ students on STEM OPT. Number of Full-time Employees in the U.S.: Study in the States guidance says, \"Provide the number of full-time employees in the U.S.\" We suggest including all employees that could be considered employed full-time by the employer. North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code: This refers to the number Federal statistical agencies use to classify business establishments. OPT Training Hours Per Week: This should indicate how many hours (on average) the student is working per week. To qualify for STEM, students must work a minimum of 20 hours per week. This can be reflected by the type of employment contract that has been agreed upon between the employer and employee. For example, a student working full-time on OPT could reflect as 40 hours per week. STEM extensions cannot be recommended if the student is working less than 20 hours per week. Start Date of Employment: If the student has been working for the employer and is continuing to work while on a STEM extension, this date should be the start date of the STEM extension. If the student is beginning new employment while already on a STEM extension, this date should reflect the student's start date with the employer. Compensation: Enter the dollar amount of salary, stipend, and/or other compensation, and the frequency of pay (per hour, per week, bi‐weekly, monthly). Other compensation may include housing, tuition waivers, transportation costs, etc. Note: The terms and conditions of a STEM practical training opportunity (including duties, hours, and compensation) must be commensurate with those applicable to similarly situated U.S. workers, except that a STEM OPT participant must work at least 20 hours per week while employed. Section 4: Employer Certification The employer should complete this section. This is the first of two certifications that an employer official \"with signatory authority\" must make on the Form I-983. The other certification is at Section 6. The person with signatory authority should sign their name, print their name legibly, date, and list the name of the employing organization. Section 5: Training Plan This section should be completed by the student and employer together. Student Name (Surname/Primary Name, Given Name): This should be the same name listed in Section 1 above. Employer Name: Refer to Section 3 employer name. Site Name & Site Address: This may or may not be the same information listed in Section 3 above. This is the name and address where the student is physically working. Section 3 may refer to company headquarters, etc. Name of Official, Official's Title, Official's Email, and Official's Phone Number: This may or may not be completed by the same person as Section 3 above. Study in the States guidance is that the person listed in this section is \"\"the appropriate individual in the employer’s organization who is familiar with, and will monitor, the student’s goals and performance.\" We suggest this refer to the person at the organization commonly referred to as the employee's supervisor. The remaining five fields are the plan-specific fields that comprise the plan itself. The form notes that \"for the remaining fields in this section, employers who already have an internal/pre-existing training plan in place may fill in the details based on that plan.\" We suggest referring to the Study in the States tutorial guidance on these questions. Section 6: Employer Official Certification ﻿This section should be completed by the employer. ﻿ This can be the same person as listed in Section 4, but may not be. However, the person who does complete this section must be an employee with signatory authority. Please note: If there are material changes to or deviations from the training plan as described in the Form I-983 the DSO has on file during the course of the 24-month STEM OPT extension period, the student and employer must complete and sign a modified training plan reflecting the those changes. The student and employer are then jointly responsible for submitting the modified Form I-983 to the student's DSO \"at the earliest available opportunity.\" Evaluation on Student Progress This section should be completed by the student and employer. A student must complete self-evaluations of his or her progress during the course of each \"STEM practical training opportunity\" his or her STEM OPT period: An initial evaluation within 12 months of the STEM OPT start recorded on Form I-983; and A final evaluation \"no later than 10 days following the conclusion of the reporting period or conclusion of his or her practical training opportunity.\" The Study in the States tutorial also indicates that a student should submit self-evaluations \"at the end of any employment,\" in addition to \"the 12 and 24 month marks from the start date of the STEM extension.\" Evaluations must be signed by the student and his or her immediate supervisor, and then submitted to the DSO listed in Section 1. Students are requested to submit these evaluations during their regular OPT reporting process.  IUPUI will keep these evaluations on file should we be asked to produce them by the immigration service.

IUPUI Immigration Bridge is a proactive partnership between IUPUI and top immigration law firm, Fragomen, Del Rey, Bernsen & Loewy LLP , which provides outside legal counsel. This partnership helps you: Navigate the complex world of visa types, eligibility, and application processes. Hire excellent candidates regardless of their immigration status. Lock in lower legal fees while offering the highest-quality legal services. While using the IUPUI Bridge Program and Fragomen's services offers no guarantee, it can increase candidates' chances of receiving an H1-B (or other work visa) and becomng an excellent hire. How it works: Graduating IUPUI international students you interview/employ (on OPT) will have access to the IUPUI Immigration Bridge Program. The student will complete a brief eForm with the IUPUI Office of International Affairs (OIA), which will then send a confirmation email to you. With your permission, OIA will send your details to Fragomen law firm who will contact you about how to begin the process. Signing up for the IUPUI Immigration Bridge Program and receiving information from Fragomen does not put you under any obligation to sign a contract with Fragomen or to follow through on filing the H1-B petition or work sponsorship. This program is purely a mechanism for you (the employer) to gather information and perhaps take advantage of reduced legal rates. The visa process can take several months depending on Federal Government timetables with no guarantee of securing a work visa. Employers will cover the costs of a work visa sponsorship. When to Start: After you complete the first round of interviews and have a strong interest in hiring an international student, you can begin working with Fragomen to help with sponsorship. Likewise, if you employ a student currently on Optional Practical Training (OPT), you can begin the process of sponsorship with your student-employee.

On campus employment refers to any job on the IUPUI campus in which you are paid by IUPUI/Indiana University. Exceptions to the “paid by IU” requirement exist for businesses that operate on campus for the purpose of serving students. One example is the Barnes and Noble bookstore. Another is Chartwells Campus Dining. Jobs paid by IU Health are not considered on-campus employment.

How Do I Get Authorization to Work On-Campus? As an F-1 student, you do not need authorization from OIA to work on the IUPUI campus. However, you must be in legal F-1 status and have a valid I-20 in order to be employed. What Are The Rules I Must Follow to Work Legally On Campus? You must: Enroll as a full time student during the fall and spring semesters. Work no more than 20 hours per week during the fall and spring semesters. Work more than 20 hours/week only during official university breaks (summer break, winter break and spring break). (Note that IU policies limit part-time employees to 29 hours/week.) Stop working as soon as you complete your program. This is typically the last day of finals for the semester or the date final thesis/dissertation edits are submitted (for students complete with all other coursework). Your 20-hour weekly maximum is a combined total for all on campus jobs you have. Hours may not be averaged over a period of time. Where can I find a job? The Office of Student Employment is your best source for assistance in finding an on campus job. This office serves undergraduate students with many services, but all students can utilize the online job board to begin their job search and view a variety of on-campus positions that are available to international students to apply. On their website, you will find a link to the job board and tips for utilizing the job board. In addition to using the job board, you should visit campus offices to inquire about any open positions and deliver your resume. The Office of Student Employment provides workshops and resources about resume writing, interview skills, networking, and many other employment-related topics. I found a job! What do I do now?

Note: Working at least 20 hours per week on OPT is considered full-time employment by DHS. Multiple Employers You may work for multiple employers, but all employment must be related to your field of study and your total hours must add up to at least 20 hours per week across all employments. Work for Hire You may perform services on a contractual relationship with an employer, rather than be hired as their regular employee. You should maintain evidence of every contractual job you accept Self-Employment You may start your own business and be self-employed. In this situation, you must work at least 20 hours per week and able to prove you have proper business licenses and are actively engaged in a business related to your degree program Employment Through an Agency You must be able to provide evidence showing that you worked an average of at least 20 hours/week while employed by the agency. You should report the name of your actual employer and the site location where you physically work. Unpaid Volunteer Employment Yes, you can do two types of volunteering: True Volunteer Work: Completely volunteer in the spirit of service, good examples of this include volunteering at a place of worship, hospital, or school.. This is not considered employment in any way. You do not need to report this to OIA or immigration. You should NOT report this in your SEVIS Student Portal. Avoiding Unemployment: Volunteering as a means to avoid hitting your 90-days of unemployment while on OPT limit. In this case, your volunteer work must adhere to the same OPT employment guidelines as employment to count as employment for immigration purposes: Must be related to your field of study Must be for at least 20 hours per week Be aware, volunteer work must be unpaid for anyone else doing the same type of work. If you are unpaid but someone else is paid, this is a violation of labor law. It is your responsibility to evaluate your own volunteer opportunity and ensure that it is truly volunteer work. You are also responsible for keeping track of your duties and hours worked. Questions on both could come up in a future benefit request (like an application for STEM extension or H1-B application). Only report this type of volunteer work to OIA or the SEVIS Student Portal if your work is directly related to your field of study. Update OIA With Changes to Your Employment and Personal Information Even while on OPT, you must update OIA with any changes to your local address, email, and telephone number. Your IU email account may be deactivated if you are not actively enrolling in classes, it is highly recommended that you report a personal email address so that important communications from OIA reach you while on OPT. You can update your local address and contact information through the Personal Information app in One.IU . You must report any changes to your address within 10 days of the change . Once your OPT begins, you will gain access to new e-forms to report your employment. To do this, you’ll use the e-form \"OPT Employer Information\" under F-1 Practical Training. You must report any changes to your employment within 10 days of the change . The following can help you decide how to properly complete the OPT Employer Information e-form in Atlas. I am adding a new employer Select this option if you are reporting a new employment. You should also use this option if you are changing employers (ending one employment and beginning another). If you have a pending STEM extension application and you have changed employers , you should carefully follow the instructions in the e-form and approval email to ensure our office can update your application with USCIS. I am updating information from a previously reported employment If you need to update any information about your previously reported employment you should select this option. Use this option to report changes in work address, changes in hours above or below full time (20 hours per week), changes in supervisor, your employer has changed their name, ect. You only need to report the employer name and what information needs to be updated. You should NOT select this option if you are changing employers completely. Note: if you work for multiple employers and are ending employment with only one, select this option and provide the end date of your current employment. I'm completing a STEM OPT validation check-in This is only used while on the STEM OPT 24 month extension. I have ended my employment and I am currently unemployed Select this option if you you need to report you have ended all employment and are currently unemployed. Remember, all changes to employment, including ending your employment, should be reported within 10 days of the change. How do I explain how my employment is connected to my field of study? In the e-form, you will need to explain how the work you do for your OPT employment is directly related to your major field of study. We recommend being able to make connections with the core classes you took in your degree program. SEVP released guidance on September 27, 2019 requiring schools to collect and report information regarding the connection between a student's OPT work and their degree program. In that guidance SEVP provided these examples of the paragraph explaining how a student's work is connected to what they studied: Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering: \"I work full time as an Electrical Engineer at ABC Corp., a government contractor. In my job, I analyze client requirements for electrical systems and provide them with cost estimates of such systems. My work requires understanding of electrical circuit theory, which I studied in-depth at the University of ABC.\" Bachelor's degree in Business: \"I work full time as a Loan Officer at a mortgage company, Happy Homes, where I meet with clients and evaluate, authorize and recommend approval of loan applications. On a daily basis, I use the knowledge I gained in my credit analysis, sales and marketing classes that I took as part of my major program of study.\" Master's degree in Music: \"I am working at a hospital playing the harp in patient rooms. I also conduct hands-on harp beginner workshops for long-term patients. On average, I work at the hospital 35 hours a week. My duties directly utilize the skills and knowledge I acquired from my coursework and degree in music therapy.\" Master's degree in Kinesiology: \"I am working 25 hours a week in a health food store as a consultant for Self-Made Inc., designing and teaching exercise classes that are incorporated into a customer's overall nutrition and exercise plan. My designs and customer instruction draw upon my studies and classwork in exercise therapy and physical reconditioning.\" PhD in Computer Science: \"I am employed as a Computer and Information Research Scientist at ABC Research Institute. I work as part of a team of scientists and engineers that designs experiments to test the operation of various software systems. My work builds on research in complex algorithms and machine learning, which I studied as part of my dissertation.\" What you need to include in your explanation: SEVP stated that they want a paragraph explaining the connection between your studies and your OPT work to include the following information: Your job title Your employer name (the company where you work) Your academic program/major The average number of hours you work per week, or statement that you are full time An explanation of how your job directly relates to what you studied - your regular duties at work should be mentioned and connected to what you learned during your academic program Please note--there is a 1000 character limit for these paragraphs, so you need to keep your answer concise. Accrue No More Than 90 Days of Unemployment Students on OPT can be unemployed for up to 90 days of their 12 month OPT period. This unemployment \"clock\" does not begin until your OPT begins (the start date listed on your EAD card). Students will still accrue unemployment days even if they exit the United States. If you are working but employed for less than 20 hours per week, you will still accrue unemployment days. If you near your 90th day of unemployment while on OPT, it is best to make plans to depart the United States, apply for a change of status, or make preparations to begin a new degree program. Take action early enough so that by the end of the 90th day of unemployment, you have another option already in progress. If you are unemployed for more than 90 days, you are considered to be out of status. What are the Available OPT Extensions? If you are an F-1 student whose OPT is based on a bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree in a STEM field, as defined by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), you may be eligible for a 24-month extension of OPT. Learn more about the OPT STEM extension » If you are an F-1 student whose employer has sponsored you for an H-1B work visa and your work authorization will begin October 1st, you may qualify for the Cap-Gap extension. Learn more about the Cap-Gap extension » Frequently Asked Questions When I am on OPT, what is my status? Can I extend my OPT like I could extend my I-20? OPT is part of F-1 status. Though you may no longer be a student, you are still in F-1 status. A 24-month extension of OPT is only possible for students who are completing a bachelor’s, master’s or doctoral degree in DHS-designated STEM ( S cience, T echnology, E ngineering, and M athematics) fields. If your degree is in a non-STEM field, the maximum amount of time for which you are eligible for OPT is 12 months for each higher degree level. See the information about STEM Extensions above. Can I travel during my OPT? Yes, but it can be very difficult to apply for an F-1 visa stamp while you are on OPT. If your visa stamp is expired, or will soon expire, keep this in mind. Please feel free to discuss your plans with an international student advisor at OIA before you travel. If you are traveling while on OPT, you are advised to carry the following: Your I-20, signed for travel (remember that each travel signature is valid for only six months during the period of OPT) A valid F-1 visa stamp A passport valid for at least six months into the future from the date of re-entry to the United States A valid OPT (EAD) card A job offer or confirmation letter. If you are traveling for business or on a vacation from the job, ensure that the letter clarifies this. Individuals with a Cap-Gap Extension The Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) strongly recommends that you not travel during your cap-gap extension. USCIS may consider your application to change from F-1 to H-1B as abandoned and deny the change. What is the SEVP Student Portal? The Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) Student Portal is a \"student view\" of information in your SEVIS record. Be advised that while you can use the Student Portal, its functionality is very limited. You must still use Atlas for your employment and other reporting obligations while on OPT . OIA updates your SEVIS record with any changes as required by law. Information you provide in the SEVIS Student Portal could potentially be incorrect based on your situation and cause you problems in the future. If you have questions or need assistance accessing the SEVIS Student Portal, please email oia@iupui.edu Will my International Student Insurance continue while I’m on OPT? If you already have IU International Student Insurance through IUPUI, it will expire at the end of the period of insurance coverage. The last day of coverage for Spring/Summer insurance is July 31, and the last day of fall insurance coverage is December 31. Typically, students who will not register for classes will use the insurance offered through their employer. If your OPT employer does not provide you with insurance coverage and you would like information about other options, contact iadvisor@iupui.edu . If you register for classes at IUPUI any time during your OPT period, you will be billed automatically for IU International insurance. If you would like to request exemption from mandatory student insurance enrollment, you must complete a Health Insurance Exemption Request in Atlas . Can I take classes or start a new degree program while on OPT? If you begin study at another education level, your OPT authorization is terminated with the notification of a new degree program in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) or with a transfer of your SEVIS record to another institution. You are supposed to work full time while on OPT. If you are pursuing full-time work in your major field of study and wish to take a class or two, there should not be a problem with this, provided that you do not begin a new education level . If you plan to begin a new academic program on a full time basis at IUPUI, you will need to fill out the e-form called “New Program I-20 Request” in Atlas . If you wish to transfer to another college or university in the United States, you must also fill out the \"Transfer Out Request\" e-form request in Atlas . These e-form requests must be submitted before you begin a new program, and the OIA approval for these requests must be granted no later than the end of the 60-day grace period following completion of OPT. OPT will automatically terminate on the day your SEVIS record is transferred to a new institution or the day your new program (at IUPUI) begins or your actual OPT end date, whichever is first. Do I need a new social security card? If your Social Security card says \"Valid for Employment with CIS Authorization,\" you will not need to get your Social Security card changed. If it says \"Not Valid for Employment,\" you will need to get it changed. If you need to get your Social Security card changed, take your OPT card, a job offer letter, your I-20, your passport, and a picture ID with you to a local Social Security office. Learn about Social Security Numbers » What can I do if my employer wants to sponsor me for a work visa? IUPUI has a program called Immigration Bridge. Immigration Bridge is specifically designed for smaller employers who may not know how to sponsor international workers.

You MUST receive an OPT recommendation I-20 (the \"OPT I-20\") BEFORE applying through the mail or online to USCIS. Applying too early or without first receiving an OPT I-20 could cause the rejection or denial of your application by USCIS. Am I Eligible for Post-Completion OPT? In order to be eligible for Post-Completion Optional Practical Training (OPT), you must: Have completed all academic coursework Be in F-1 status at the time of applying Be fully enrolled for 2 semesters (Fall and Spring semester) Have not used more than one year of full-time CPT or OPT at this degree level Eligibility due to COVID-19 The U.S. government has not updated the regulations related to Curricular Practical Training (CPT) and Optional Practical Training (OPT) due to COVID-19. The U.S. government requires that you to be in person in the U.S. for 30 weeks of classroom instruction before you are eligible. Only weeks that you have been physically present in the United States count towards the 30-week requirement. Here are some examples to make this requirement clearer: If you arrived in the U.S. on August 12, 2022, and enrolled in classes that met August 23, 2022-December 16, 2022, you have 16 weeks of instruction. Note that the time you were in the U.S. before classes started do not count. To be eligible for CPT you would need to complete at least another 14 weeks of instruction (13 week courses would not be enough). If you were enrolled in classes that met August 23, 2022-December 16, 2022, but participated online until you arrived in the U.S. on September 9, 2022, you have accumulated only 14 weeks of instruction. Note that the time you were enrolled in class outside the U.S. does not count. To be eligible for CPT in summer 2023, you would also need to complete 16 weeks of classroom instruction in spring 2023. When Should I Apply? Applying for OPT can be a lengthy process and requires sending your application to USCIS for adjudication. To ensure you apply at the right time, you need to determine when your program is complete. Please refer to our Completing Your Program page for information on when your program is considered complete. Once you know your program completion date: You can apply to USCIS for OPT up to 90 days before your program completion date You can apply up to 60 days after your program completion date This is the OPT \"Application Window,\" your application must reach USCIS during this window to be accepted. Applying too early or too late may result in a rejected application. How Should I Apply? (Optional Step) Attend an OPT Information Session While optional, the OIA OPT Information Sessions are a great place to start when applying for OPT. Our team of advisors will go through the application process, help students identify their program completion date, and determine when they should apply for OPT-- as well as a host of information on how to maintain your status while on OPT. Step 1: Paper Application -  Complete the I-765 If you filing a paper-based application, you will find the Form I-765 here . We recommend you also complete the Form G-1145 so that you will receive free e-notifications of your application status. Always make sure you are using the most recent version of the I-765 by checking the edition date on USCIS's website You can find helpful hints on filling out the I-765 here . You do not need to fill out the paper I-765 if filing online, the online application will collect this same information-- the I-765 and above tips may be useful to reference later when completing the online form. Remember! You must first receive an OPT I-20 before applying online! Step 2: Gather Your Other Documentation As part of your OPT application, you will need to supply USCIS with copies of the documents below. Make sure you gather these documents as soon as possible, so that your application is not delayed. Copy of your most recent electronic I-94 record OR copy of the front and back of your current paper I-94 card Copy of your passport identification page (and any renewal pages) Copy of your most recent F-1 visa stamp Copy of any previously issued EAD cards If you entered the U.S. in a visa status other than F-1, a copy of your I-797 approval notice. Step 3: Passport Photos and Fee Payment Passport Photos Review these recommendations on passport photographs. Photos must measure 2 inches by 2 inches and must be in color; photos should be printed on glossy photo paper. Head should be positioned directly facing the camera. Photo should capture from slightly above top of hair to middle of chest. Background should be plain white or off-white. Photos should be taken within the last 30 days prior to the extension application. Photos used for obtaining a non-U.S. passport or a U.S .visa stamp are generally not acceptable, as they are often not the correct size, and rarely taken within 30 days of the OPT application. Photos with poor lighting (too dark) may be rejected. If filing a paper-based application , we recommend writing your name and I-94 number on the back of your photos in pencil or with a felt tipped pen (it is important to avoid marring the photos or leaving marks). There are several pharmacies and stores (such as CVS, Walgreens, or Walmart) that will take and print passport-sized photographs for you at a low cost. We recommend you have your photographs taken by one of these stores, and you can ask them to retake the photo at no cost to you if it does not meet the recommendations outlined above. Paying your I-765 Fee There is a $410 fee for the OPT application. If filing a paper application can pay this fee by check or money order made out to: USCIS. If applying online you can submit credit or debit card information to pay. Do not sign the back of your check! This will void the check. Step 4: Determine OPT Requested Start Date and Complete E-Form in Atlas Log into Atlas and complete the \" Post Completion OPT Processing Request \" e form located in your F-1 Practical Training menu . In this e-form, you will need to provide your Academic Advisor's information to confirm when your program will be complete. You will also need to choose a requested OPT start date. Your requested OPT start date must be after your program completion date (If you complete your program May 9th, your requested start date can be as early as May 10th) Your requested OPT start date can be up to 60 days after your program completion date This is a requested date. If your application is approved by USCIS after the requested date, your OPT will begin date of approval by USCIS Step 5: Make Recommended Changes to Your Materials and Print I-20 Copy After your completed Post Completion OPT Processing Request e-form has been reviewed, the Office of International Affairs will create a new I-20 recommending you for OPT. Along with this I-20, your Advisor will recommend edits or corrections to your application materials--make sure to make any suggested corrections before sending your application to USCIS! Your approval email will include a scanned copy of your OPT recommendation I-20, you should print this copy to include with your packet. Make sure to sign your I-20 copy. You will receive instructions about when and where to pick up your new I-20 as well. If you no longer live in Indianapolis, we can send your OPT recommendation I-20 by UPS for $10, or by U.S. mail for free. Step 6: Compile Your OPT Application Packet or File Online For online applications, now is when you should complete the online application with USCIS , being careful to upload your materials correctly and selecting \"c(3)(B) Student Post-Completion OPT\" as your eligibility category. For paper applications, USCIS can better review your packet if you prepare it in a certain way. Below is the order we recommend for your documents. Please do not staple any individual documents within your packet. Check ($410) Photos (we recommend you place these in a small plastic bag with a zipper, plus write your name and I-94 number on the back of each photo with a pencil or felt-tip pen) I-765 form New I-20 recommending OPT Most recently issued I-20 I-94 record Passport Identification Page F-1 Visa Stamp Other supporting documentation if applicable (SEVIS printout for CPT, I-797 Approval notice, prior EAD, etc) Optional: Form G-1145 Once you have compiled these documents, staple the whole packet together (including the check and the baggie that has your pictures in it—be careful not to staple through the pictures). You should make a copy of your entire OPT packet for your records. Step 7: Send Your OPT Packet to USCIS For paper applications, you should send your completed OPT application packet to USCIS. We recommend you use a courier services such as UPS or FedEx, or registered first-class U.S. mail service to have your packet delivered. These methods will both provide you with information on when the packet was delivered to USCIS, which you should keep for your records. For both online and paper applications , USCIS must receive your application no later than 30 days immediately following the date on page 1 of your I-20 (where the DSO has signed), or the date your 60 day grace period ends, whichever is sooner . Paper applications must be sent to the proper address for the shipping method you have chosen; you can find the proper mailing addresses for USCIS here . Step 8: Receive Your Receipt Notice and Wait Once your OPT application has been filed with the USCIS, a Receipt Notice will be issued. It will come to the address you listed in 5.a.-5.e. in Part 2 of your I-765 application form. You can check the status of your application by going to this site and entering your Receipt Number, which can be found toward the upper, left-hand side of your Receipt Notice. If you need to update your address with USCIS while your application is still pending you can do so here . Frequently Asked Questions For information on maintaining your F-1 status while on OPT and work requirements, please see our Maintaining Your Status on OPT page. Am I still in F-1 status on OPT or when my application is pending? Yes-- you are still in F-1 visa status even while on OPT. OPT is a work authorization, not a separate status. Students may remain in the United States, even after their grace period, if they have a pending application with USCIS. Can I work on campus while I wait for my OPT to be approved? Not after your program completion date-- on campus work authorization ends when your program ends. Can I travel while I’m waiting for my OPT to be approved? Yes, but OIA recommends caution when traveling outside of the United States after you have graduated, while you are waiting for your OPT authorization. Your U.S. immigration status is determined by your I-94 card, and because the I-94 information is no longer available each time you depart from the United States, establishing your F-1 status while outside the country will be difficult if USCIS has questions about your application. If USCIS sends a request for additional information about an aspect of your application and it is not resolved in a timely fashion, your application will be denied. According to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), you may travel back to the United States while your OPT is pending in order to search for employment. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) explains this in detail on its website. Visit ICE » OIA also recommends caution if you need to renew your visa while abroad. Since OPT is optional, the consular officer may not feel it’s necessary for you to return to the U.S., especially if they feel you have any intention of immigrating. If you do decide to travel outside the U.S. while waiting for your OPT to be approved, make sure to carry: Your passport A signed I-20 A valid F-1 visa stamp An I-797C (receipt notice from USCIS) How do I make sure I receive my EAD card when my OPT is approved? You should make sure you can receive mail that is listed as \"first class or higher\" at your mailing address. Make sure you or the person you've put as \"in care of\" on your application are listed as residing at the mailing address with USPS. You may need to confirm this with your local post office. If you move while your OPT is pending and can no longer receive mail at your mailing address, make sure to update your address with USCIS as soon as possible. Will my International Student Insurance continue while I’m on OPT? If you already have IU International Student Insurance through IUPUI, it will expire at the end of the period of insurance coverage. The last day of coverage for Spring/Summer insurance is July 31, and the last day of fall insurance coverage is December 31.  Typically, students who will not register for classes will use the insurance offered through their employer. If your OPT employer does not provide you with insurance coverage and you would like information about other options, contact iadvisor@iupui.edu . If you register for classes at IUPUI any time during your OPT period, you will be billed automatically for IU International insurance. If you would like to request exemption from mandatory student insurance enrollment while you are on OPT, you must complete a Health Insurance Exemption Request in Atlas . Can I take classes or start a new degree program while on OPT? If you begin study at another education level, your OPT authorization is terminated with the notification of a new degree program in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) or with a transfer of your SEVIS record to another institution. You are supposed to work full time while on OPT. If you are pursuing full-time work in your major field of study and wish to take a class or two, there should not be a problem with this, provided that you do not begin a new education level . If you plan to begin a new academic program on a full time basis at IUPUI, you will need to fill out the e-form called “New Program I-20 Request” in Atlas . If you wish to transfer to another college or university in the United States, you must also fill out the \"Transfer Out Request\" e-form request in Atlas . These e-form requests must be submitted before you begin a new program, and the OIA approval for these requests must be granted no later than the end of the 60-day grace period following completion of OPT. OPT will automatically terminate on the day your SEVIS record is transferred to a new institution or the day your new program (at IUPUI) begins or your actual OPT end date, whichever is first.

You MUST receive a STEM OPT recommendation I-20 (the \"STEM OPT I-20\") BEFORE applying through the mail or online to USCIS. Applying too early or without first receiving an STEM OPT I-20 could cause the rejection or denial of your application by USCIS. OIA is unable to create the STEM OPT I-20 until our office verifies that your I-983 training plan is completed, signed, and meets all program requirements. Please read the steps below carefully before completing the e-form request in Atlas. Am I Eligible? In order to be eligible for the 24-month OPT STEM extension, you must: Already be on post-completion OPT and hold an appropriate degree in one of the DHS-approved STEM fields. Be employed by, or have a job offer from, an employer who is registered with the E-Verify employment verification system. E-Verify is an Internet-based system operated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in partnership with the Social Security Administration. Employment must be paid and full time (over 20 hours per week). Have fewer than 90 days of unemployment while on OPT. Submit the OPT application to USCIS prior to the expiration of the current post-completion OPT. USCIS must receive the application before the expiration date on the current EAD. When and How Should I Apply? Follow the steps below to request a new STEM OPT recommendation I-20 from our office (STEM I-20). Please note: there is a $159.18 IUPUI Office of International Affairs fee for each STEM OPT application. This fee will support advising and technical services to meet federal regulations and provide other essential support for international students while on STEM OPT. I am applying for my first 24-month extension. You are eligible to apply for your full 24-month STEM benefit as long as USCIS receives your STEM OPT application prior to your 12-month OPT period expiring. You may apply up to 90 days prior to your 12-month OPT expiriation date (printed on your EAD). Please note, USCIS must receive your application no later than 60 days immediately following the date on page 1 (where the DSO has signed), or the date your current OPT EAD card expires, whichever is sooner. I am applying for my second STEM extension. Students may apply for a second STEM extension on the basis of a previously conferred degree OR after completing a new STEM eligible degree at a higher education level. If you have questions about your specific second STEM extension eligibility, contact iadvisor@iupui.edu . For application based on a prior STEM degree: This can be used in situations where a student obtains a B.S. in Chemistry and then earns an MBA. If the student is on 12-month OPT following the MBA degree, s/he may apply for a second STEM extension if they obtain a position relating to the field of chemistry for the STEM extension period of employment authorization. Students would need to apply for this prior to the MBA 12-month OPT period ending. For application based on a STEM eligible degree at a higher education level: In this case, the student would need to apply for and use the original 12-month OPT for the degree level, then apply for the second 24-month STEM extension prior to the 12-month OPT period ending. If you file a timely application for an extension, you will be able to continue employment while the extension application is pending with USCIS, until it is approved or denied, or for 180 days, whichever comes first. Please follow the these step-by-step instructions about how to apply for your STEM extension: Step 1: Paper Application - Complete the I-765 If you will apply for the STEM extension through the paper based application, you can find the Form I-765 here . We recommend you also complete the Form G-1145 so that you will receive free e-notifications of your application status. You do not need to complete the I-765 paper form if applying online, however the information below may be useful when completing the online application (Remember, do not apply online until you receive your STEM I-20!) Hints for filling out the form I-765 : In the \"I am applying for:\" section, check the box that indicates, \"Renewal of my permission to accept employment...\" #1 Write your family name, first name (given name) and middle name as they appear on your passport ID page. #2-4 Only complete this section if you have used other names before. If you have never used a different name, just leave this section blank. #5 Whatever address you list in this section is where USCIS will send your EAD card. If you could potentially move while this application is being processed, use a stable address such as your employer or consider obtaining a P.O. Box. This is the address your new EAD will be sent to upon approval of your application. If you need to update this mailing address because you have moved, you can do so on the USCIS website . #6 If you are using your own street address, check \"Yes.\" If you are using another address where you do not currently live, check \"No\" and type the address where you live in #7, a-e. #10 Check the box to the left of your gender. #11 Check the box to the left of your marital status. #12 Check \"Yes\" #13a If you have a SSN, check the Yes box. If you do not have an SSN, select the No box. #13b Provide your SSN in the blanks. #14 If you would like to apply for OPT and an SSN at the same time, select Yes. If not, select No and skip to #18a, leaving #15-17 blank. #15 If you select that Yes, you would like to apply for OPT and an SSN (Yes on #14), then you must select Yes for #15. #15 - 17 - only complete these questions if you answered Yes to #14. If you answered No, then skip. #16a and 16b: list your father's family and given names #17a and 17b: list your mother's family name (at her birth) and given name. #18 List the country of your citizenship/nationality. #19 List the city, state/province, and country of your birth. #20 List your date of birth in MM/DD/YYYY format. #21a This is the 11-digit number on your most recent I-94 card. #21b Your passport number (from your most recently issued passport). #21d List the country that issued your current passport. #21e List the expiration date of your passport in MM/DD/YYYY format. #22 List the date of your last arrival into the U.S., you can find this on your most recent electronic I-94 record. #23 List the place where you went through U.S. Immigration on your last entry to the U.S. You may be able to see this on your port of entry stamp - the three letter code directly under the word ADMITTED. #24 USCIS wants to know what your status was the last time you entered the U.S. For most students applying for OPT, it is “F-1 Student”. If you have recently changed to F-1 status, this may be your previous status. #25 This must be “F-1 Student”. #26 Write your SEVIS number as it appears on your I-20 document. #27 (c)(3)(C) #28a Degree = your degree level and major CIP code (see your OPT I-20 for CIP code) #28b Employer’s name as listed in E-Verify #28c Employer’s E-Verify Identification Number (E-Verify information can only be obtained from your employer) #29-31 Leave these blank. Certification Section: Don't forget to sign your application. List the date you signed your form in the MM/DD/YYYY format Include your telephone number with area code. This should be listed in the ###-###-#### format Interpreter's and Preparer's Sections: Leave these blank, unless: Someone translated this form for you into a language other than English; or Someone else completed the form on your behalf. Step 2: Complete the Form I-983 with Your Employer Please note, you do not need to include this form in your application to USCIS; however, in order for OIA to issue you an I-20 recommending the STEM extension, we must have a completed Form I-983. You can find instructions on how to complete this form online here . Please read completely through the information available to you through both the OIA and DHS websites . Links to the form and step-by step guidance can be found on both websites. You MUST complete the form with your employer before submitting your request for an I-20 to OIA. Please note that the I-983 must be signed in ink, per form instructions. Specific guidance for your employer can be found here » Step 3: Gather Your Other Documentation As part of your STEM OPT Extension application, you will need to supply USCIS with copies of the documents below. Make sure you gather these documents as soon as possible, so that your application is not delayed. Copy of your most recent electronic I-94 record OR copy of the front and back of your current paper I-94 card Copy of your passport identification page (and any renewal pages) Copy of your most recent F-1 visa stamp Copy of the front and back of your current OPT card (EAD) Letters from all of your OPT employers confirming your employment, including start and end dates and average hours worked per week (to prove you have not used more than 90 days of unemployment) OR first and last pay receipts and offer letters from all of your OPT employers, if you cannot get employment letters. Evidence of STEM degree (this can be an unofficial transcript printed from one.iu.edu, an official transcript from IUPUI’s registrar, or a copy of your diploma) Step 4: Passport Photos and Fee Payment Passport Photos Review these recommendations on passport photographs. Photos must measure 2 inches by 2 inches and must be in color; photos should be printed on glossy photo paper. Head should be positioned directly facing the camera. Photo should capture from slightly above top of hair to middle of chest. Background should be plain white or off-white. Photos should be taken within the last 30 days prior to the extension application. Photos used for obtaining a non-U.S. passport or a U.S .visa stamp are generally not acceptable, as they are often not the correct size, and rarely taken within 30 days of the OPT application. Photos with poor lighting (too dark) may be rejected. There are several pharmacies and stores (such as CVS, Walgreens, or Walmart) that will take and print passport-sized photographs for you at a low cost. We recommend you have your photographs taken by one of these stores, and you can ask them to retake the photo at no cost to you if it does not meet the recommendations outlined above. Paying your I-765 Fee There is a $410 fee for the STEM Extension application. You can pay this fee by check or money order made out to: USCIS. Do not sign the back of your check! This will void the check. Step 5: Complete the Atlas STEM Extension Request Log into Atlas and complete the \"24-Month STEM OPT Extension Request eform located in your F-1 Practical Training menu. You will select if you are applying online or through the paper form and upload copies of your application materials. Remember, your I-983 must be completed, signed, and meet all program requirements before OIA can issue you a STEM I-20! Step 6: Make Suggested Changes and Compile Your Application Materials Once you receive your e-form approval email, it is very important that you make any suggested changes to your application materials before submitting to USCIS. You will also receive a copy of your new I-20 that you should print, sign and date, and then send with your application If you are submitting the paper-based application, make sure to submit Check ($410) I-765 signed by hand in black ink only Optional: Form G-1145 For both the paper-based and online application , you should also submit Photos (for paper applications we recommend you place these in a small plastic bag with a zipper, plus write your name and I-94 number on the back of each photo with a pencil or felt-tip pen) New I-20 recommending STEM OPT Previous I-20 recommending OPT EAD front and back I-94 record Passport Identification Page F-1 Visa Stamp Job confirmation letters from all initial OPT employers Evidence of STEM degree If submitting a paper application, staple the whole packet together (including the check and the baggie that has your pictures in it—be careful not to staple through the pictures). For online filing some of the recommended items (job confirmation letters, etc) can be uploaded as additional documentation. Step 7: Submit your STEM OPT Extension Application USCIS must receive your application no later than 60 days immediately following the date on page 1 of your I-20 (where the DSO has signed), or the date your current OPT EAD expires, whichever is sooner . If submitting a paper-based application, you should be careful to send your packet to the proper address for the shipping method you have chosen; you can find the proper mailing addresses here For online applications, you can submit using the \"apply online\" button found on the USCIS I-765 webpage . Step 8: Receive Your Receipt Notice and Wait Once USCIS has received your application, they will send you a receipt notice. You will be able to continue employment while the extension application is pending with USCIS, until it is approved or denied, or for 180 days, whichever comes first. You should continue reporting your employment information to OIA during your OPT STEM extension. If you have questions about the 24-month STEM extension, email iadvisor@iupui.edu . Frequently Asked Questions Can I apply for STEM OPT if I work for a contracting company? SEVP’s Study in the States website states that “the employer that signs the Form I-983 must be the same entity that employs the student and provides the practical training experience” and that you must have a “bona fide” employer-employee relationship with the company providing the training. If the company that employs you is not the company providing training and oversight to you, the opportunity may not be a good fit for the STEM extension. As a result, OIA recommends speaking with your employer to discuss being hired directly rather than working through a staffing or consulting agency. Applying for a STEM OPT extension while employed by a staffing or consulting agency could carry some risk, OIA cannot guarantee that USCIS will find your employee/employer relationship to be a bona fide relationship, thus approving your application. When can I apply for my 24-month STEM extension? You may apply for your 24-month STEM OPT extension 90 days prior to your 12-month OPT expiration date through the OPT expiration date (printed on your EAD card). Can I travel abroad while waiting for STEM OPT approval? We do not recommend that you travel outside of the U.S. while your STEM extension application is pending. What if my employer changes while my STEM extension application is still pending? Contact our office as soon as possible by emailing iadvisor@iupui.edu . If you have changed to a different STEM eligible position while your application is still pending, OIA will need to update your application with USCIS. Let our advising team know if you applied online or through the paper-based application. How do I maintain my status on the STEM OPT extension? Carefully review the information available on our website about reporting requirements and how to maintain your status while on the STEM OPT extension. What is the SEVIS Student Portal? The Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) or the group that regulates SEVIS, the database that produces your I-20, has created a student portal by which students who are currently on 12-month or 24-month STEM extensions can report changes to their records. OIA recommends that you continue to use Atlas for this purpose and report your address/employer changes to OIA directly. OIA updates your SEVIS record with any changes as required by law. Information you provide in the SEVIS Student Portal could potentially be incorrect based on your situation and cause you problems in the future. Can I volunteer on my 24-month STEM extension? Unpaid employment or volunteer work is not able to meet your employment requirement while on STEM. You may volunteer for things truly volunteer (like a a place of worship or hospital), however, you should NOT record this volunteer work in your employment history. Volunteer work should not be reported in the SEVIS Student Portal or to OIA as it is not considered employment under the STEM guidelines.

During your program of study, your status is based on your program start and end dates. On OPT and the STEM extension, your status is now based on your OPT start and end dates (as found on your EAD). It is important to follow the rules of OPT so you can continue to maintain your F-1 visa status. We would recommend you carefully review information on the DHS Study In the States website for in depth information about the STEM OPT Extension as well as the information provided below. As a reminder: If you have timely filed your STEM OPT application and have received an I-797 receipt notice from USCIS, you may remain in the United States and continue working while waiting on a decision from USCIS until the application is approved, denied, or 180 days passes. To maintain your status on STEM OPT, you must: Work 20 or more hours per week per employer Work in your major field of study Maintain a up-to-date I-983 training plan with your employer Update our office of any changes to your employment, address, or contact information within 10 days Submit validation reports through Atlas every 6 months Not accrue more than 150 days of unemployment Work 20 or More Hours Per Week, In Your Field of Study Work on OPT should be directly related to your major field of study-- this means you should be able to connect your employment to the core classes for the degree you completed at IUPUI. There are many types of allowable employment while on STEM OPT, however remember that unpaid positions and self-employment are not acceptable forms of employment for the STEM extension. Paid Employment You may work for pay while on the STEM OPT extension. Note: Working at least 20 hours per week on OPT is considered full-time employment by DHS. Multiple Employers While multiple employers is allowed on the STEM OPT extension, it can be more difficult. You must have a valid form I-983 on file for all STEM employers and you must work at least 20 hours per week at each STEM employer. Employment Through an Agency or Work for Hire SEVP’s Study in the States website states that “the employer that signs the Form I-983 must be the same entity that employs the student and provides the practical training experience” and that you must have a “bona fide” employer-employee relationship with the company providing the training. If the company that employs you is not the company providing training and oversight to you, the opportunity may not be a good fit for the STEM extension. As a result, OIA recommends speaking with your employer to discuss being hired directly rather than working through a staffing or consulting agency. Applying for a STEM OPT extension while employed by a staffing or consulting agency could carry some risk, OIA cannot guarantee that USCIS will find your employee/employer relationship to be a bona fide relationship, thus approving your application. Maintain a Valid, Up-to-Date I-983 Training Plan With Your Employer During the STEM extension, students must maintain an up-to-date training plan that has been signed by both the student and the employer. You will also complete a self-evaluation on page 5 of your I-983 at set points throughout your STEM extension. You should submit an updated I-983 through Atlas any time... You change employers. You will submit a final self-evaluation on your previous employer's I-983 and a new I-983 for your new employer. At the 12 and 24 month mark. You will submit self-evaluations (pg 5) on your progress at the 12 and 24 month marks during the STEM extension. Any time there are material changes to the training plan. If information about your employer, your position, or the agreed upon training plan change, you should submit an updated copy to OIA within 10 days of the change. You must obtain updated signatures on the I-983 when updating for material changes. Update OIA With Changes to Your Employment, Personal Information, and STEM Reporting Even while on OPT and the STEM extension, you must update OIA with any changes to your local address, email, and telephone number. Your IU email account may be deactivated if you are not actively enrolling in classes, it is highly recommended that you report a personal email address so that important communications from OIA reach you while on OPT. You can update your local address and contact information through the Personal Information app in One.IU . You must report any changes to your address within 10 days of the change . You will still use the  \"OPT Employer Information\" e-form under F-1 Practical Training to report changes in your employment . You must report any changes to your employment within 10 days of the change . The following can help you decide how to properly complete the OPT Employer Information e-form in Atlas. I am adding a new employer Select this option if you are reporting a new employment. You should also use this option if you are changing employers (ending one employment and beginning another). If you have a pending STEM extension application and you have changed employers , you should carefully follow the instructions in the e-form and approval email to ensure our office can update your application with USCIS. I am updating information from a previously reported employment If you need to update any information about your previously reported employment you should select this option. Use this option to report changes in work address, changes in hours above or below full time (20 hours per week), changes in supervisor, your employer has changed their name, ect. You only need to report the employer name and what information needs to be updated. You should NOT select this option if you are changing employers completely. Note: if you work for multiple employers and are ending employment with only one, select this option and provide the end date of your current employment. I'm completing a STEM OPT validation check-in Students on the STEM extension must \"check in,\" or submit validation reports, every 6, 12, 18, and 24 months during the STEM extension. This validation report is completed by selecting this option in Atlas and confirming the information requested in the e-form. Remember, at the 12- and 24-month marks you will also submit a self-evaluation on your I-983. I have ended my employment and I am currently unemployed Select this option if you you need to report you have ended all employment and are currently unemployed. Remember, all changes to employment, including ending your employment, should be reported within 10 days of the change. How do I explain how my employment is connected to my field of study? In the e-form, you will need to explain how the work you do for your STEM OPT employment is directly related to your major field of study. We recommend being able to make connections with the core classes you took in your degree program. SEVP released guidance on September 27, 2019 requiring schools to collect and report information regarding the connection between a student's OPT work and their degree program. In that guidance SEVP provided these examples of the paragraph explaining how a student's work is connected to what they studied: Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering: \"I work full time as an Electrical Engineer at ABC Corp., a government contractor. In my job, I analyze client requirements for electrical systems and provide them with cost estimates of such systems. My work requires understanding of electrical circuit theory, which I studied in-depth at the University of ABC.\" Bachelor's degree in Business: \"I work full time as a Loan Officer at a mortgage company, Happy Homes, where I meet with clients and evaluate, authorize and recommend approval of loan applications. On a daily basis, I use the knowledge I gained in my credit analysis, sales and marketing classes that I took as part of my major program of study.\" Master's degree in Music: \"I am working at a hospital playing the harp in patient rooms. I also conduct hands-on harp beginner workshops for long-term patients. On average, I work at the hospital 35 hours a week. My duties directly utilize the skills and knowledge I acquired from my coursework and degree in music therapy.\" Master's degree in Kinesiology: \"I am working 25 hours a week in a health food store as a consultant for Self-Made Inc., designing and teaching exercise classes that are incorporated into a customer's overall nutrition and exercise plan. My designs and customer instruction draw upon my studies and classwork in exercise therapy and physical reconditioning.\" PhD in Computer Science: \"I am employed as a Computer and Information Research Scientist at ABC Research Institute. I work as part of a team of scientists and engineers that designs experiments to test the operation of various software systems. My work builds on research in complex algorithms and machine learning, which I studied as part of my dissertation.\" What you need to include in your explanation: SEVP stated that they want a paragraph explaining the connection between your studies and your OPT work to include the following information: Your job title Your employer name (the company where you work) Your academic program/major The average number of hours you work per week, or statement that you are full time An explanation of how your job directly relates to what you studied - your regular duties at work should be mentioned and connected to what you learned during your academic program Please note--there is a 1000 character limit for these paragraphs, so you need to keep your answer concise. Accrue No More Than 150 Days of Unemployment Across All OPT Time Students on the STEM OPT extension can be unemployed for up to 150 days of their entire OPT period. This includes any unemployment you accrued during your first year of OPT. Students will still accrue unemployment days even if they exit the United States. If you near your 150th day of unemployment while on OPT, it is best to make plans to depart the United States, apply for a change of status, or make preparations to begin a new degree program. Take action early enough so that by the end of the 150th day of unemployment, you have another option already in progress. If you are unemployed for more than 150 days, you are considered to be out of status. Frequently Asked Questions Can I travel during my STEM OPT? Yes, but it can be very difficult to apply for an F-1 visa stamp while you are on OPT. If your visa stamp is expired, or will soon expire, keep this in mind. Please feel free to discuss your plans with an international student advisor at OIA before you travel. If you are traveling while on STEM OPT, you are advised to carry the following: Your I-20, signed for travel (remember that each travel signature is valid for only six months during the period of OPT) A valid F-1 visa stamp A passport valid for at least six months into the future from the date of re-entry to the United States A valid OPT (EAD) card A job offer or confirmation letter. If you are traveling for business or on a vacation from the job, ensure that the letter clarifies this. Individuals with a Cap-Gap Extension The Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) strongly recommends that you not travel during your cap-gap extension. USCIS may consider your application to change from F-1 to H-1B as abandoned and deny the change. What is the SEVP Student Portal? The Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) Student Portal is a \"student view\" of information in your SEVIS record. Be advised that while you can use the Student Portal, its functionality is very limited. You must still use Atlas for your employment and other reporting obligations while on OPT . OIA updates your SEVIS record with any changes as required by law. Information you provide in the SEVIS Student Portal could potentially be incorrect based on your situation and cause you problems in the future. If you have questions or need assistance accessing the SEVIS Student Portal, please email oia@iupui.edu Will my International Student Insurance continue while I’m on STEM OPT? If you already have IU International Student Insurance through IUPUI, it will expire at the end of the period of insurance coverage. The last day of coverage for Spring/Summer insurance is July 31, and the last day of fall insurance coverage is December 31. Typically, students who will not register for classes will use the insurance offered through their employer. If your OPT employer does not provide you with insurance coverage and you would like information about other options, contact iadvisor@iupui.edu . If you register for classes at IUPUI any time during your OPT period, you will be billed automatically for IU International insurance. If you would like to request exemption from mandatory student insurance enrollment, you must complete a Health Insurance Exemption Request in Atlas . Can I take classes or start a new degree program while on STEM OPT? If you begin study at another education level, your STEM OPT authorization is terminated with the notification of a new degree program in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) or with a transfer of your SEVIS record to another institution. You are supposed to work full time while on STEM OPT. If you are pursuing full-time work in your major field of study and wish to take a class or two, there should not be a problem with this, provided that you do not begin a new education level . If you plan to begin a new academic program on a full time basis at IUPUI, you will need to fill out the e-form called “New Program I-20 Request” in Atlas . If you wish to transfer to another college or university in the United States, you must also fill out the \"Transfer Out Request\" e-form request in Atlas . These e-form requests must be submitted before you begin a new program, and the OIA approval for these requests must be granted no later than the end of the 60-day grace period following completion of OPT. OPT will automatically terminate on the day your SEVIS record is transferred to a new institution or the day your new program (at IUPUI) begins or your actual OPT end date, whichever is first. Can I volunteer as a form of employment on the STEM OPT Extension? Unpaid employment or volunteer work is not able to meet your employment requirement while on STEM. You may volunteer for things truly volunteer (like a a place of worship or hospital), however, you should NOT record this volunteer work in your employment history. Volunteer work should not be reported in the SEVIS Student Portal or to OIA as it is not considered employment under the STEM guidelines. What if my employer sponsors me for an H-1B? If you are an F-1 student whose employer has sponsored you for an H-1B work visa and your work authorization will begin October 1st, you may qualify for the Cap-Gap extension.

You are required to enroll full-time each fall and spring semester, but there are some exceptions to this rule. Make sure you follow instructions carefully! This is the most common area for students to make mistakes resulting in a loss of legal status. Academic Difficulties If you are experiencing academic difficulties in your first semester , you may request approval to drop below full-time. In all cases, you must maintain at least half of the full-time requirement: 4 credits for graduate students, and 6 credits for undergraduates. Advance approval from OIA is required. Examples of academic difficulty include difficulty with English language, unfamiliarity with U.S. teaching methods, improper course level placement, etc. Request approval through Atlas» Medical Reasons If you have an injury or illness preventing course attendance, you may request permission to take a reduced course load or withdraw from classes completely . You may request no more than one year (aggregate) of reduced course load based on a medical exception. Certification from a U.S. licensed medical doctor or a licensed clinical psychologist, and advance approval and from OIA is required. Obtain a Medical Reduced Course Load Form» Final Semester of Study When you are in your final semester of degree study, this option permits you to register for only the credits necessary to complete the degree requirements. You also can use this option if you are a graduate student completing your final semester of non-research coursework, but will continue to work on a thesis, dissertation, or final project. OIA approval required. Request approval through Atlas» Graduate Students with Assistantships If you are working as an Associate Instructor, Research Assistant, or Graduate Assistant (employed by your department as a Student Academic Appointee for 15 to 20 hours a week [37.5–50% FTE]), you may enroll in 6 credit hours. If you are not sure if you meet this requirement, ask the department you are working for. OIA approval not required. Graduate Students Conducting Research If you have completed all required course work for your degree program, and are now working only on research for a final project, dissertation or thesis, you are only required to enroll in research credits. In this situation,  a thesis, dissertation, or final project research course may be considered full-time at fewer than 8 credit hours. These full time equivalencies are determined by the Registrar. If you have no further research credits to enroll for, but are not done with your research, consult with your department on further enrollment options.

You do not have to enroll in summer sessions unless you begin or finish your program of study at IUPUI in the summer. Full-time enrollment requirements includes: Undergraduates must enroll in at least 12 credit hours each fall and spring semester. Graduate students must enroll in at least 8 credit hours each fall and spring semester. Professional students (Dentistry, MD, JD) should follow full-time enrollment requirements as determined by their academic program. Beginning your academic program in the summer If the summer is your first or final academic term studying at IUPUI, or you are returning from a leave of absence with an initial F-1 SEVIS record, your enrollment requirements for each summer session (both Summer 1 and Summer 2 sessions) will be: Six credit hours for undergraduate students per summer session (12 total credits for the full summer term) Four credit hours for graduate students  (8 total credits for the full summer term) Three credit hours for graduate students with a Student Academic Appointment of 37.5–50% FTE, whose graduate department supports this enrollment. (6 total credits for the full summer term, when combined with the SAA of 37.5–50% FTE) Dropping below full-time enrollment without authorization from OIA is a serious violation of your F-1 status! Read about full-time exceptions and procedures Concurrent Enrollment at Another School You may take courses at another school that will count towards your full-time enrollment requirement at IUPUI. However, you must: Maintain at least one regular (not online) course at IUPUI Report your concurrent enrollment using the Concurrent Enrollment Verification eForm in Atlas . Consult with an academic advisor to make sure any courses you take at another school will transfer to IUPUI and count towards your degree program. Online Enrollment You can take classes online to help fulfill your full-time enrollment requirement as an F-1 student. However, only one online 3-credit class will count toward your enrollment requirement each semester. You may not take only an online course in your final semester of study. Classes that count as “in-person” are coded as: P, HY, IN and IS. As you plan your course enrollment, make sure you are following this normal guidance. Flexibility on online enrollment that has been allowed during the COVID pandemic ended in May 2023. Incomplete Courses Incomplete courses from a previous semester may not count towards your full-time enrollment for a current semester. Additionally, you may not use incomplete courses to extend your program. For F-1 status purposes, your program will be considered completed at the end of your final semester, even if you have an incomplete course. Enrollment Deadline Students must be enrolled full time or have received permission to under enroll prior to the full-time enrollment deadline. Each fall and spring semester the full-time enrollment deadline is 30 days after the first day of classes. Are you sponsored by your government or other agency? Your sponsor may limit the amount of online or hybrid courses you are allowed to take. Make sure to check with your sponsor before registering for any online or hybrid course work to prevent a large bill that your sponsor will not pay.

This normally means you must depart the United States. An exception exists when course withdrawal is recommended by a U.S. physician due to a medical condition. Withdrawing from classes Before withdrawing from classes it is extremely important to obtain advance approval from OIA. This is done by completing the Notification of Complete Withdrawal from Classes e-form in Atlas . You should use this form: If you are withdrawing mid-semester during Spring or Fall If you will not enroll for a future Fall or Spring semester Please note that approval to withdrawal will result in the termination of your SEVIS record for the reason “Authorized early withdrawal”. You must depart the U.S. within 15 days of your SEVIS termination. Leave of Absence due to a medical condition If you will withdraw from classes due to a medical condition, you must apply for OIA permission first. This requires a recommendation from a U.S. licensed physician. Learn more » If approved for a medical leave of absence, you may stay in the United States if you wish. Your SEVIS record will remain active, so you may depart and re-enter the U.S. as needed. Please make sure to inform an OIA advisor of your plans. Returning to the U.S. after a leave of absence If your SEVIS record was terminated due to a leave of absence, then you cannot return to the U.S. until you have an active SEVIS record. This requires that you work with an advisor in the Office of International Affairs well in advance of your return. Absence of less than 5 months If you were absent from the U.S. for less than 5 months, then an advisor may be able to request that your SEVIS record be reactivated before you return to the U.S. This would enable you to use your current I-20 and visa (if valid) for entry into the U.S. Reactivation can be requested 60 days prior to your return to the U.S. You must contact an international student advisor to request reactivation of your SEVIS record before returning. If your SEVIS record is still terminated when you arrive at the port of entry, you may not be permitted to enter the U.S. Absence of more than 5 months If you were absent from the U.S. for more than 5 months, you will not be able to use your current I-20 for re-entry into the U.S. OIA will create a new SEVIS record for you, and send you a new I-20. This means: You will need to submit updated financial documentation to OIA. OIA will need information from your academic advisor about your expected graduation date. You will need to pay the $350 SEVIS fee again. You will need to apply for a new visa stamp, if the F-1 visa stamp in your passport has expired. You will be limited to entering the U.S. within the 30 days before your I-20 start date. You will need to wait a full academic year (one fall and one spring semester) before gaining eligibility for Practical Training (CPT or OPT). OIA will request copies of your new I-94 and visa stamp upon your return. To request a new I-20 after a leave of absence, contact us at iadvisor@iupui.edu . Applying for re-admission after a leave of absence If you have been absent from IUPUI for 2 semesters or more, then you are required to apply for re-admission as a returning student . If you were forced to take a leave of absence due to academic dismissal, then you will need to apply to your academic school for a reinstatement of your academic status. Questions? If you have questions about how your absence will affect your status at IUPUI, or if you wish to discuss your plans in greater detail, you may call OIA at 317-274-7000 to make an appointment with an advisor, or email an advisor at iadvisor@iupui.edu .

It is absolutely critical that you stay in legal status. If you fall out of status, you no longer have legal immigration status. If that happens, you could have serious problems with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). It could compromise your ability to get a U.S. visa or even enter the United States in the future. If you do not maintain legal status, you will also be unable to receive employment authorization . OIA is happy to provide you with the information and advice you need to maintain your status. However, maintaining your status is your responsibility. How to Maintain Your F-1 Status It is essential to check your IUPUI email regularly. If you do not, you could miss communications that are important to maintaining your status. Maintain a Valid I-20 Always be aware of the expiration date on your I-20, and do not let your I-20 expire . Be sure to get a travel signature before departing the United States. You will also need to get a new I-20 if you change your degree level, your major, your funding source, or the number of F-2 dependents you have. Timing can be critical for all of these changes, so start the process early. Most of these actions can be requested through Atlas . Please call 317-274-7000 to make an appointment with an advisor if you have questions about maintaining a valid I-20. Enroll Full Time To stay in status, you need to enroll in a full load of classes each fall and spring semester. Undergraduate students must enroll in at least 12 credit hours each semester. Most graduate students must enroll in at least 8 credit hours. Learn the exceptions to this rule » Work Only With Authorization Except for on-campus employment, you must receive authorization from either OIA or the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) before you begin working. Learn more about your employment options » Keep Your Address Updated You must update your address within 10 days of any move, even if it is only temporary. Learn about changes of address » Keep a Valid Passport You must have a valid passport at all times. If your passport will expire while you are in the United States, you need to contact your embassy to find out how to renew it. Abide by Grace Periods You have a 60-day grace period following the completion of your program or Optional Practical Training (OPT). This is the period of time before you are required to leave the United States. You have several options during this period, but if you have not taken action by the time it is over, you must depart the United States.

This allows you to keep your unique SEVIS ID number, which is critical for maintaining your legal status in the United States. How to Transfer your SEVIS Record from IUPUI to a New Institution Log in to Atlas using your university technology account username and passphrase. In the F-1 Student Services menu, select “Transfer Out Request”. Complete this e-form. Pay special attention to the date you are requesting that OIA release your SEVIS record to your new school. As of that date, your SEVIS record will belong to your new school and you will no longer have work authorization granted by IUPUI . Before you can submit the e-form, you will be prompted to upload a copy of your admission letter to your new school. OIA can only transfer your SEVIS record to one institution even though you may be applying to many. Complete the “Transfer Out Request” only after you are certain you will attend the new school. Transfer Guidelines for Specific Situation You have completed (or will complete) your program at IUPUI and will begin a new program at a new institution. You must request your SEVIS transfer and the release must be granted within your 60 day grace period following the completion of your program at IUPUI. You must also begin your new program within five months of completing your IUPUI program. For example: If you complete your bachelor’s degree on May 10, you must receive a SEVIS transfer no later than July 9 AND you must begin your new program before October 10. You have completed (or will complete) your program at IUPUI and are pursuing your OPT period, you will begin a new program of study at the conclusion of your OPT. Your OPT will end on the date that your SEVIS record is transferred to your new institution. OPT is not transferable. If you intend to have your SEVIS record transferred after your OPT ends, you will need to request and receive the SEVIS transfer during your 60 day grace period following the completion of your OPT. Additionally, you must begin the new program within 5 months of your last day of OPT. If you will begin your new program after 5 months, you are not eligible for a SEVIS transfer. You are currently attending IUPUI, have not (and will not) complete a degree program, and wish to transfer your SEVIS record to another school. You should request your record to be transferred after your last day of study at IUPUI but before the next term begins. For example: You are studying for a bachelor degree at IUPUI and wish to transfer to another school after your second year. You should request your SEVIS release from IUPUI after your last final exam in May but before your semester begins at your new school in August. Please be aware, if you are working on-campus at IUPUI, you will no longer have authorization to do so on the day your SEVIS record is released to the new school. You have attended or completed a program at IUPUI, and are currently outside the United States, but plan on re-entering to attend another institution. To be eligible for a transfer, you can be outside the country for no more than five months without being registered in coursework in the United States. If you plan to be outside the country for more than five months and do not intend to register in U.S.-based coursework during that time, or have already been outside of the United States for more than five months, you are not eligible for a SEVIS transfer. Your new institution will need to make a new I-20 with a new SEVIS ID for your re-entry. You will need to pay the SEVIS I-901 fee again and you should apply for a new F-1 visa stamp. You will begin at a new school more than 5 months after the end of your OPT or last day of study at IUPUI. If the gap between your studies exceeds 5 months, you are not eligible for a SEVIS transfer. Your new program will need to issue you a new I-20 for you, and you will need to leave the United States. You will need to pay the SEVIS fee again and apply for a new F-1 visa stamp. Some students do not wish to leave the U.S. and want to find a way to stay during the gap between studies. If this is your situation, contact your OIA advisor and your new school advisor to see if you have further options. If a solution is not found, you will need to leave the United States or else you will be in violation of your F-1 status. Getting Your New I-20 Once your SEVIS record has been transferred to your new school, they will be able to make a new I-20 for you. Be sure to contact your new school to find out what their policy on issuing new I-20s is. At IUPUI, this is done within the first two weeks of classes if students are not traveling. Remember, if you are traveling outside the United States after your record has been transferred to your new school, you must use your new I-20 to re-enter the U.S. No matter what your travel plans are, you must report to your new school within 15 days of your new I-20 start date. Things to Know about Transferring your SEVIS Record A SEVIS transfer applies only to your immigration documentation and I-20. Academic records are not included in this process. Please review the timing information above carefully. Your SEVIS transfer release date will be the day you complete your program, the final day of your last semester at IUPUI or a date you specify in your Transfer Out Request—whichever is later. If you decide to cancel your transfer, you must notify us in writing before your transfer release date. After that date, we will no longer have access to your SEVIS record. In addition, all travel and employment benefits authorized through IUPUI will end on your transfer release date. For assistance or more detailed information, contact iadvisor@iupui.edu .

If you are not compliant with regulations, we may be forced by law to terminate your SEVIS record. Termination of a SEVIS record is very serious and can have many negative consequences for you. It can end your ability to stay in the United States, attend school, and apply for work authorization. SEVIS termination means that you are not in legal status (\"out of status\") according to the Department of Homeland Security. If you are out of status, contact us to learn about your options. Staying in the U.S. beyond your allowable grace period is also a violation of F-1 regulations. If your SEVIS (or I-20) is terminated OR you overstay your grace period, you could be accruing unlawful presence. This can lead to arrest and deportation proceedings. Accruing unlawful presence may result in being barred from the U.S. for many years or even permanently. Important Concepts Unlawful Presence The period of time when you are in the U.S. without being admitted or paroled or when you are not in a \"period of stay authorized by the secretary.\" Barred from Entry Being barred from the U.S. means that you cannot enter the U.S. in any immigration status for a specified length of time. You can receive a 3-year or 10-year bar from the U.S. if you have more than 180 days or one year of unlawful presence, respectively. Accrual of Unlawful Presence Accrual means adding to, accumulating, obtaining, or growing. This means you accumulate or grow days of unlawful presence each and every day beyond your status violation or end of your lawful grace period. Reasons for the termination of a SEVIS Record include: Unauthorized employment (employment without advanced authorization from OIA or USCIS) Unauthorized withdrawal from classes (dropping all your classes without advance permission from OIA) Unauthorized drop below full course of study (dropping below full time enrollment without advance authorization from OIA) Expulsion and suspension Failure to enroll in classes Enrollment in too many online classes Failure to report OPT employment (automatic action by SEVIS, the database that produces your I-20) Accrual of 90 days of unemployment while on OPT (automatic action by SEVIS, the database that produces your I-20) If your record is terminated while on OPT, contat us for information about your options. In most cases, the termination of your SEVIS record means that you must make plans to immediately depart from the United States. In other words, there is no grace period after termination. If your SEVIS record is terminated, contact us to schedule an appointment immediately. Days of unlawful presence begin when your SEVIS record is terminated, unless your international student advisor has indicated a grace period for departure from the U.S. Staying after any grace period will also result in days of unlawful presence. If you have an F-2 spouse or children, they will also begin accruing days of unlawful presence if your SEVIS record is terminated. F-2 dependents can also violate status separately from your F-1 status. This will also result in your dependents accruing days of unlawful presence and perhaps a being barred from entry to the U.S. We do not know what the future impact of even one or two days of unlawful presence will be if you wish to apply for a new visa stamp or submit an application or petition to USCIS (for example, if a future employer wishes to sponsor you for an H1-B status). Even a few days of unlawful presence could cause you to be ineligible for this type of future status. The Best Ways to Ensure That You Stay in Legal Status Check your IUPUI email at least once per day Always stay enrolled full time Contact your OIA advisor before you drop any courses Do not break any university rules or U.S. laws Only work with proper authorization Do not let your I-20 expire Academic Advisor Resources Departmental Hiring & Hosting F-1 Students Applying for a Visa Employment SEVIS Violations Full-Time Enrollment Maintaining Status Dependents of F-1 Students Completing Your Program I-20 Extensions Local Address SEVIS Fee F-1 SEVIS Transfer from IUPUI Travel Outside the U.S. H-1B Specialty Workers J-1 Scholars J-1 Students Permanent Residence Taxes & Social Security Numbers DACA and Undocumented Student Information Immigration Updates Office of International Affairs social media channels Twitter Facebook Instagram YouTube Copyright © 2023 The Trustees of Indiana University , Copyright Complaints Accessibility | Privacy Notice"

SEVIS stands for the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System. It maintains current information on nonimmigrant students, exchange visitors, and their dependents (i.e., all those in F or J status). As an F-1 student, you will be assigned a SEVIS number, and a SEVIS record will be created for you. SEVIS will track you from the time you receive your I-20 until you complete your program. The Office of International Affairs is responsible for updating your SEVIS record. We are required to report: Full-time enrollment Failure to enroll Dropping below a full-time course load without prior authorization Any other failure to maintain student status or complete program A change in legal name or address Your graduation if it occurs prior to the expected program end date Start date of your next session Transfers Program extensions Off-campus employment authorization Any other major changes to your program For F-1 students, the SEVIS fee is $350. You Must Pay the SEVIS Fee If You Are: Applying for a visa as a new student beginning an IUPUI program with an I-20 Applying to change your status to F-1 from another nonimmigrant status while in the United States Filing for reinstatement after being out of status while in the United States for more than five months Traveling to the United States in F-1 status as a Canadian citizen. You cannot pay the fee at your port of entry. You Do Not Need to Pay the SEVIS Fee If: You are an F-1 student in lawful status transferring between schools in the United States You are the dependent of an F-1 student and you have F-2 status Paying the SEVIS Fee You can pay the SEVIS fee online or by mail. We recommend paying online, because it is the fastest method. It can be paid by you or by a third party, from inside or outside the United States. No matter which method you choose, your payment must be accompanied by Form I-901. Remember that paying the SEVIS fee is only the first step of the visa application process , so get it done as soon as possible. If you are an F-1 student with a country of citizenship or country of birth of Cameroon, The Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, or Nigeria, you must pay by money order, Western Union Quick Pay, or certified check drawn from a U.S. bank. To Pay the SEVIS Fee Online Go to the SEVIS fee processing site . Complete Form I-901 online (be sure to insert your name exactly as it appears on your I-20) and supply the necessary MasterCard, Visa, or American Express credit card information. Print a copy of the online receipt. We suggest that you keep a copy of your receipt with your other important immigration documents. To Pay the SEVIS Fee by Western Union Quick Pay Complete Form I-901 at FMJFee.com . You will get a unique payment coupon number, necessary to validate and process your payment at Western Union. You cannot submit a SEVIS fee payment via Western Union without this coupon number. Print a copy of the payment coupon and take it to your local Western Union office. Fill out the Quick Collect/Quick Pay Form according to the information found at the bottom of the printed coupon. Present the coupon and your payment to the Western Union agent for processing. A copy of instructions and sample forms can be viewed at and printed from the ICE website . Frequently Asked Questions Will the Department of Homeland Security keep a record of my payment on file? Fee payments should be entered into your permanent immigration (SEVIS) record, but it is strongly recommended that you retain a copy of your fee receipt to use as needed. I applied to more than one school and have more than one I-20 form. What happens if I pay the SEVIS fee for one school and then change my mind and decide that I want to attend a different school?  Is my paid SEVIS fee transferrable? Yes, the SEVIS fee is transferable. But you must take the I-20 form with the SEVIS ID number that you listed on the I-901 form to the U.S. consulate/embassy, in addition to the I-20 form from the school you wish to attend. Be sure to make your intentions clear to the Consular Officer. For more information, see these SEVIS I-901 Fee FAQs » What if my F-1 visa application is denied? The SEVIS fee will not be refunded. However, if you reapply for a new F-1 visa within 12 months of the denial, you will not have to pay the fee again.

You can also keep informed about Indiana University and IUPUI's response to COVID-19 here . While you are studying at IUPUI you may want to travel outside the United States, such as: to return to your home country over summer break. to explore another country on spring break. to participate in a study abroad program. But, before you pack your luggage, there are some steps you need to take to protect your F-1 status. Get a Travel Signature on Your I-20 Before you leave the country, make sure you have a valid travel signature from an OIA advisor on page 3 of your I-20. You will not be able to re-enter the United States without one. To get a travel signature, make a request through Atlas at least two weeks before you plan to travel, and bring your I-20 to OIA. Travel signatures are valid for one calendar year or until the completion of your program, whichever comes first. Once you have returned to the U.S., be sure to check your I-94 information . It’s important that this information is accurate! Make Sure Your I-20 Reflects Your Current Situation If there have been any changes in your situation (for example, if you have changed your major, degree level, or source/s of financial support) that are not indicated on your current I-20, you will need to get a new one. For changes in major or source/s of funding, request a travel signature through Atlas and note the changes in the “Note any Special Requests” section. You may be asked to provide updated financial documents. For a change in degree level, you will need to complete the “New Program I-20” request in Atlas . However, you do not need to request a travel signature. When your new degree program request is approved, a new I-20 will be printed and signed for travel. Timing can be critical for all of these changes, so start the process early. In most cases, updated financial documentation will be required to process your new I-20. Make Sure Your I-20 Will Not Expire While You Are Out of the Country Check the completion date in section 5 of your I-20 to see whether it is about to expire. If it expires while you are outside the U.S., you will not be able to re-enter the U.S. If your I-20 is about to expire and you have not yet completed your program, you will need to apply for an I-20 extension through Atlas . You do not need to make a separate request for a travel signature. When your extension is approved, a new I-20 will be printed and signed for travel. Updated financial documentation will be required to process your I-20 extension. Make Sure Your Visa is Valid Is the F-1 visa stamp in your passport valid beyond the date you plan to re-enter the United States? If not, you must apply for a new visa stamp while you are abroad. Read about renewing your visa » Travel to Countries Other Than Your Home Country If you are traveling to a country other than your home country, you may need a visitor or transit visa. To find out, visit that country’s embassy website at Foreign Embassies of Washington, D.C. , and search for the consular section nearest you. If you are traveling to the European Union, and your home country is not within the European Union, you may apply for the Schengen Visa , which permits travel within E.U. countries. For the latest travel advisories, visit the U.S. Department of State’s website . Traveling to or through Canada? Canada now requires Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) for many citizens of visa-exempt countries who enter or transit through Canada. This means that you may need to apply for authorization even if you are only changing flights in Canada. Learn more on the Canadian Immigration & Citizenship website » Short trips to Mexico, Canada, or islands adjacent to the United States (such as the Bahamas) You may be eligible to return from Mexico, Canada and islands adjacent to the United States even if you have an expired visa. This is generally allowable for trips of 30 days or less. It is essential that you read all eligibility criteria on the Immigration and Customs Enforcement website before you decide to use this exception. Don’t forget, you need a travel signature on your I-20 even for short trips to nearby countries! Traveling after completing your program? OIA cannot sign your I-20 for travel during your post-graduation grace period, and you cannot re-enter in your F-1 status if you depart the United States. Learn more about travel while on OPT » Wondering if you can travel during OPT? You can. However, there are some risks involved and precautions to take.

At IUPUI/Indiana University, H-1B status is used for full-time tenure-track faculty, academic researchers, research technicians (RS07 level or higher), and professional staff. The University does not sponsor part-time H-1B employment unless it is a percentage time appointment (not hourly) and includes benefits. In order to obtain H-1B status, your hiring department must document the appropriateness of the wages to be paid, the duties and responsibilities of the position to be filled, and your qualifications to fill that position. In addition, your department must assume all business-related expenses for filing the H-1B petition. Six-Year Maximum You can maintain H-1B status for a maximum of six years. Your initial H-1B status can be granted for up to three years, and you can renew your status for up to three additional years. After six years in H-1B status, you must leave the United States for one year before an employer can file a new H-1B petition for you. H-1B status may be granted for longer than six years in limited cases. Specific Work Limitation H-1B employees can do only the work that is listed on their H-1B petition. The employer (department), title, duties, and location of the job must match what the petition says. If the employee job changes, the department may need to file a new H-1B petition. Learn more about how to maintain H-1B status » Dual Intent and Permanent Residence H-1B employees may choose to pursue permanent residence in the United States. This is different from other visa categories, which require you to prove that you plan to return to your home country after your program ends. Because H-1B status enables you to come here with “dual intent,” many scholars believe that the H-1B offers an easier pathway to permanent residence than other visas do. No H-1B Cap for IUPUI If you are seeking H-1B status through IUPUI, you are not subject to the U.S. Congress’s H-1B cap on the number of H-1B petitions. Universities, research organizations, and some nonprofit organizations are exempt from the cap. Previous Participation as a J-1 or J-2 If you have been in the United States as a J-1 exchange visitor or J-2 dependent and are subject to the two-year home residency requirement , you have two options. Before you apply for an H-1B, you can either fulfill the requirement or have it waived. H-4 Dependents Your spouse and unmarried children who are under age 21 may qualify for H-4 dependent status. This means they can come to the United States with you. They cannot get jobs, but they can be part-time or full-time students. H-4 dependents qualify for in-state tuition rates at IUPUI after they have been in Indiana for 12 consecutive months.

For example, you must maintain a valid passport and a valid I-94 card at all times, and you must report any changes in your local address. Changes in employment may also affect your H-1B status. IUPUI departments should contact us ischolar@iupui.edu three months before an H-1B employee’s position changes or is close to ending. We will help guide the employee through the next steps. Changes in Your Duties or Position Your H-1B status covers a specific position, minimum salary, employer, and geographical region. To avoid violating your status, you should perform only the work described in your approved H-1B petition. Your position might change, of course. These changes could include new job duties, a new job title, or a transfer to another IUPUI department. OIA must review any changes in your employment. You and your host department should consult with us three months before these changes occur. We will help you determine if you need to file a new H-1B petition, which would require three months for processing. Completion or Termination of Employment Your H-1B status ends when you complete your work at IUPUI or your employment is terminated, even if your petition covers a longer period. If you complete your work, you should take one of three actions before your last day: File a petition with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to extend your H-1B status with the same employer or a new employer. Or file a petition with USCIS to change your status to another category. Or make plans to leave the United States. If your employment is terminated, you should plan to leave the United States immediately. Contact us ischolar@iupui.edu , and we will guide you through this process and help you plan your next steps. Leaving the United States If you do not extend or change your status, you should plan to leave the country immediately when your H-1B status ends. Some H-1B employees are granted a 10-day grace period before they must leave the country. A Customs and Border Protection officer must add the grace period to your I-94 card after admitting you into the United States, which does not always happen. To be safe, assume that you must leave when your H-1B status ends. How Do I Extend My H-1B Status? The steps to extend your status are the same as the steps to apply for your initial status.

If you are applying from abroad, you must also apply for an H-1B visa stamp at a US Embassy or Consulate to enter the United States. If you are a Canadian citizen, you do not need an H-1B visa stamp to enter the United States. You only need the H-1B Approval Notice (Form I-797) and your passport. The typical USCIS processing time for H-1Bs is four to six months. For faster USCIS processing, your department can choose to pay for premium processing . The USCIS processing time for premium-processed H-1Bs is fifteen days. Once your H-1B application gets approved you need to follow the three steps below. Schedule a Visa Appointment (If Applying from Abroad) We will email you after your application has been approved, and also provide you with the original H-1B approval notice and a copy of the H-1B application as filed (including Form ETA 9035, the Labor Condition Application). If you are applying from abroad, you should schedule your visa appointment and interview at the nearest U.S. consulate . The interview is a requirement for getting your visa stamp, which you need in order to enter the United States. You must get the stamp from a U.S. consulate outside the country. You cannot get it inside the United States. Wait times for appointments and for visa approvals can vary. To see how long this process takes in your country, read the Department of State’s visa wait time information . Prepare Your Documentation We recommend that you take the following documents to your visa interview: A valid passport Original H-1B approval notice (I-797) A current letter from the IU department that hired you. The letter must confirm your employment, title, and salary. A photocopy of your H-1B petition (Form I-129), including the Labor Condition Application (Form ETA 9035) If you lived in the United States previously, documentation that you resided here legally. Examples include a previous I-20, an IAP-66 or DS-2019, and an I-797 from other employers. The consulate where you have your interview may require additional documents. Plan for Security Clearances The consulate may require security clearances before it will issue your H-1B visa stamp. The requirement may be because of your name, birth country, country of citizenship, field of study, or field of research. Security clearances can take two to six weeks, or more than six weeks in rare cases. Plan for these wait times when you make arrangements to travel to the United States. Can OIA  Help Me Get My H-1B Status? Yes! We are here to help employees and departments throughout this process. Please contact us by email: ischolar@iupui.edu for more information. How Do I Extend My H-1B Status? The steps to extend your status are the same as the steps to apply for your initial status. This must be initiated by your campus department. Please talk to your host professor about extending your H-1B status. Remember: You can maintain H-1B status for a maximum of six years. Your initial H-1B status can be granted for up to three years, and you can renew your status for up to three additional years.

You can travel abroad during your H-1B program. Your trip may be personal (to visit relatives, for example) or professional (to attend a conference or work with colleagues overseas). These recommendations will help ensure that you have a smooth trip. Gather and Check Your Documents You will need to take the following documents: Your passport Monitor the I-94 website to make sure the information is correct We recommend taking the following documents too: Two to three of your recent pay stubs confirming your current employment Original H-1B Approval Notice (Form I-797) A photocopy of your H-1B petition Check your passport, H-1B Approval Notice (Form I-797), and H-1B visa to ensure that they have not expired. If your passport will expire within six months, we recommend renewing it. If your visa will expire while you are abroad, you will need to have a new visa interview and get a new H-1B visa to return to the United States. Please see our H-1B approval handout for more information. Request a Visitor’s Visa, If Necessary If you are traveling to a country other than your home country, you may need a visitor’s visa. You may even need a visa for a transit stop or layover. To find out, visit that country’s embassy website and search for the nearest Consular Section. Travel to or through Canada There are new requirements for travelling to or through Canada.  Some travelers may not need a visa but need Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) to enter or transit Canada.  Go to this page to see if you need an eTA or a visitor visa to enter Canada: http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/visas.asp You should plan that you will need one or the other. Plan for Additional Wait Times If you have to get a new visa while you are abroad, the process can take six weeks or more because of security clearances. When you make travel arrangements, you and your department should plan for the possibility of these wait times. What Do I Do if I Am Traveling to Canada or Mexico and I Have an Expired Visa Stamp? If your trip will last 30 or fewer days, you may be able to re-enter the United States using the expired stamp. This procedure is called Automatic Visa Revalidation. Contact us for more information.

Read below to see if any apply to your situation. We will continue to process applications for admission and issue the necessary immigration documents (Forms I-20 or DS-2019 in most cases), regardless of citizenship. Invitations to visiting scholars and offers of employment to foreign nationals from the impacted countries will likely require additional advising and processing time prior to employment eligibility. Although travel from certain countries/regions will no longer be restricted, appointment backlogs at U.S. embassies and consulates continue to be an issue for foreign nationals who need visas. Any international travel that will require a visa to return to the U.S. should be carefully considered. Travel restrictions for individuals traveling from southern Africa (effective November 29, 2021) The U.S. president signed a proclamation on November 26, 2021, that suspended entry for immigrants and nonimmigrants traveling to the U.S. who have been in southern Africa in the 14 days before their arrival to the U.S. The countries specified in the proclamation are Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe. Learn more about the restrictions At this time, there is not a national interest exemption (NIE) in place for F-1 or J-1 students or scholars. This means if you have been in one of these countries, you will need to spend at least 14 days in a different country before traveling to the U.S. COVID Vaccine and Test Requirements for U.S. Entry (effective November 8, 2021) Traveling by airplane from anywhere Effective November 8, 2021, all geographic travel ban restrictions will be replaced by a global requirement that all nonimmigrants must be fully vaccinated with an FDA or WHO-approved vaccine before entering the U.S. by air travel (including from Canada or Mexico). You must also provide evidence of a negative COVID test result taken no more than 1 day before boarding a flight to the U.S. Some very limited exemptions to the vaccine requirement will be allowed. One notable vaccine exemption allowed under the new proclamation is for citizens (passport holders) of countries with limited COVID-19 vaccine availability . The U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) will maintain this list and update it every 3 months. U.S. Customs and Border Protection will use the CDC's list to determine which countries qualify. Vaccination exceptions will not be granted based on a  recent country of residence. IU also has specific requirements and resources related to COVID-19 vaccinations, testing, and masking. Traveling by car or ferry from Mexico or Canada From November 8 until December 31, vaccination is not required for essential purposes (attending an educational institution is considered an essential purpose during this period). Starting January 1, 2022, travel by car or ferry from Mexico or Canada will follow the vaccine requirements listed above. Additional COVID-19 enrollment guidance for international students Admitted and current international students can find additional information about enrollment requirements, visas, travel, health and safety, and student life during the pandemic on OIA's COVID-19 webpages . Suspension of visa processing in Russia (effective May 12, 2021) Effective May 12, 2021, the U.S. Embassy in Moscow will reduce consular services . It will cease to process non-immigrant visas (like F-1 student or J-1 exchange visitor) for non-diplomatic travel. This means you will not be able to apply for a student visa in Russia. We do not know how long this will last, but we are concerned about the impact it is having on students and scholars from Russia. We are working in collaboration with a number of higher education associations, and our government relations officials, in an effort to encourage the resumption of non-immigrant visa processing as soon as possible. Students and scholars may be able to seek visa appointments as third country nationals in other locations. You would need to determine eligibility and processes for this with an Embassy or Consulate. Suspending entry of certain Chinese graduate students and visiting scholars (effective June 1, 2020) Page last updated: October 29, 2021 Effective June 1, 2020 the U.S. president signed a proclamation that suspends the entry of certain F-1 and J-1 graduate students and visiting scholars from China.  We do not know all of the implications of this policy but it may affect nonimmigrant visa issuance and entrance into the U.S. through Customs and Border Protection. At this time, we will continue to process immigration documents for all F-1 and J-1 students and visiting scholars from China. Who is NOT impacted All new and continuing undergraduate students All legal permanent residents A spouse of a U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident F-1 or J-1 graduate students or visiting scholars \"in a field involving information that would not contribute to the PRC’s military‑civil fusion strategy\" This section of the proclamation is vague. Implementation is the responsibility of the U.S. Departments of State and Homeland Security. This means that eligibility for entry may be reviewed both during the visa application process, and at the port of entry when travelling to the U.S. Who is impacted New graduate F-1 or J-1 students and visiting scholars who: Currently receive funding, are employed by, study at, or conduct research at or on behalf of \"an entity in the PRC [People's Republic of China] that implements or supports the PRC’s 'military-civil fusion strategy'\" Have previously been employed at, studied at, or conducted research at or on behalf of \"an entity in the PRC [People's Republic of China] that implements or supports the PRC’s 'military-civil fusion strategy'\" The U.S. Secretary of State shall determine if current F-1 or J-1 graduate students and visiting scholars who are in the United States and have a valid visa meet the criteria regarding involvement in \"military-fusion strategy\" and determine whether their visa should be revoked. The proclamation defines \"military-civil fusion strategy\" as \"actions by or at the behest of the PRC to acquire and divert foreign technologies, specifically critical and emerging technologies, to incorporate into and advance the PRC’s military capabilities.\" We are deeply saddened by this turn of events. We stand with our students and scholars from China who are here to learn from and share their knowledge with IUPUI. We welcome students and visiting scholars from all backgrounds and citizenships, knowing that we are better together. Additional Information for All Students and Scholars Your Rights in the U.S. As an international student or scholar, you have specific rights in the U.S. Know your rights » Hiring an attorney If you'd like to speak with an experienced immigration attorney on how the order may apply to your specific situation, contact us . We'll work with the IU Office of General Counsel to refer you to an attorney.

Immigration information can be complicated, but we will help you understand it, complete your steps on time, follow all rules, and meet all requirements. If you have questions, contact us . What Is the Difference between a Visa and a Visa Status? A visa is a stamp in a person's passport that allows him or her to request permission to enter the United States. Your visa status is the immigration category that you were granted when you entered the United States, such as F-1, J-1, or H-1B. Visa status must be maintained throughout a person's time here in order to stay legally in the United States—and we will help with that. Student Visas at IUPUI Only people who are enrolled full time in classes or are obtaining a degree are considered to be students for visa purposes. You will probably have one of two types of nonimmigrant status: F-1 status : Most IUPUI students are in F-1 status. J-1 status : J-1 status is primarily for students who come to the United States during an exchange program, generally for a year or less. Visas for Faculty Members, Workers, Researchers, and Other Visitors If a person's main purpose at IUPUI is to work or do research (this includes Ph.D. researchers and research interns), he or she will come to IUPUI on one of the visas below. Most nonstudents come to IUPUI in J-1 or H-1B status. Departments at IUPUI are responsible for initiating the visa process and keeping it moving. Read about departmental hiring and hosting , and contact us with any questions. Most Common Visas for Nonstudents J-1 Scholar J-1 Scholar status for nonstudents may be used for professors and researchers (who may stay up to five years), specialists in a field (who stay one year or less), and short-term scholars (who stay six months or less). Learn more about J-1 Scholar status » H-1B Specialty Workers H-1B status is for professional positions that require a bachelor’s degree or higher in a specialty field. H-1B status can be granted for up to six years.

With 144 countries represented in the IUPUI student body, we continue to welcome students from every country and will not waver in our commitment to engaging the world in education and partnership. “ Indiana University embraces openness to the world and joins the great global universities of the world in seeking to attract the best students, scholars and researchers from every country. Any action that impacts, even temporarily, the ability of our students and scholars, to freely travel to academic conferences, engage in research outside the United States, or return to their home countries without fear of being denied readmission to the United States has a harmful impact on our ability to fulfill our educational and research mission. Indiana University Board of Trustees resolution, February 3, 2017 (excerpt) “ At IUPUI and at colleges and universities around the world, education and research are immeasurably enriched by the presence and contributions of a wide variety of perspectives and voices, including international students, scholars, and faculty. We welcome and support them without regard to their immigration status and are committed to fostering an environment where they can succeed. We will continue and intensify the university’s longstanding advocacy for expanded access to higher education for all IUPUI students living in the United States and around the world. Our overarching goal at IUPUI is student success. In our curricula and programming, in our services and support, in our words and actions, everything we do aims toward preparing IUPUI students to be active and engaged citizens who are ready to contribute their knowledge, energy, and passion to making this world a better place. Regardless of the circumstances, we remain committed to that important goal. IUPUI Chancellor Nasser H. Paydar January 30, 2017 statement (excerpt) “ The Office of International Affairs and IUPUI is unequivocally committed to the values of global engagement and inclusivity. With this in mind, we are disappointed by the new 2020 immigrant visa restrictions recently added to other “travel bans” already in place. Any action that impacts, even temporarily, the ability of our students and scholars to freely travel to academic conferences, engage in research outside the United States, find employment in areas of national interest, or return to their home countries without fear of being denied readmission to the United States has a harmful impact on our ability to fulfill our educational and research mission. At times like this, we need to work together. We respect the power of international dialogue, interaction, and travel to transform lives and reduce barriers among people. We are proud to advance internationalization at IUPUI, an unapologetically global and inclusive campus that is committed to making the world a better place. Hilary E.

The J-2 visa is for a dependent spouse or an unmarried child who is under the age of 21. J-2 status enables dependents to stay in the United States during the J-1 visitor’s program. J-1 visitors submit information about J-2 dependents during the J-1 application process . OIA Is Here to Help. Sometimes a different visa status is more appropriate than the J-2. For example, a dependent may be eligible for other visas if the visit will be brief. A dependent child over the age of 21 is not eligible for J-2 status. The J-1 visitor can consult with us ischolar@iupui.edu about the best option for his or her dependents. Funding Documentation J-1 visitors must prove that they have monthly financial support of at least $1,310 . The first J-2 dependent must have at least $666 per month in support, and each additional dependent must have at least $562 per month. The J-2 dependent must have financial support for the length of the J-1’s program. A family of four, for example, would need to show proof of $1,310 per month in support for the J-1 scholar, $666 per month for the spouse, and $562 per month for each child. The total is $3100 per month, and it must be available for the entire program. Travel Outside the United States J-2 dependents follow the same travel procedures as J-1 visitors. See the J-1 travel procedures » Remaining Here While a J-1 Travels A J-1 visitor must maintain his or her status in order for J-2 dependents to stay in the United States. If the J-1 is out of the country for a significant period of time, this might affect the J-2’s ability to remain in the United States. If you cannot find the information you are looking for, or need to clarify information for your situation, you can contact us by emailing ischolar@iupui.edu . Enrollment in IUPUI Courses J-2 dependents can enroll in IUPUI courses as part-time or full-time students. They will have many choices of courses and fields. IUPUI offers more than 225 academic programs , ranging from accounting to Youth Physical Wellness Programming . Work authorization for J-2 Dependents J-2 work authorization can only be approved by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS).

Please pay special attention to the following requirements. Maintain continued employment in the offered position A J-1 exchange visitor's research area, departmental location of program, dates of participation, and description of financial support is maintained in the U.S. government's SEVIS system by the Office of International Affairs (OIA). If there are changes in the position or its conditions including dates, location, research focus, or financial sponsorship offered, these should be conveyed to OIA scholar services staff so the scholar's J-1 status can be updated within SEVIS. Change of Address USCIS also requires OIA to keep the J-1 scholar's home address and work site address up to date in the SEVIS system.  If employed by IU, the scholar can update this in https://one.iu.edu If not employed, they can contact ischolar@iupui.edu and inform us of the new address. Maintain Health Insurance All J-1 scholars must have sufficient health insurance for themselves and their dependents during their entire stay. Whether the scholar receives employee benefits or is enrolled in the international scholar insurance program, the department should work with OIA to facilitate enrollment in a health insurance program. Learn more » Travel Authorization J-1 scholars must also follow prescribed USCIS procedures for international travel during their J-1 program including obtaining a travel signature from OIA scholar services staff prior to departure. OIA is also able to offer the scholar and dependents a letter to use in visa renewal.

(The exception is if you are Canadian. See below.) If you are already in the United States in J-1 status, you need to transfer your J-1 SEVIS (Student and Exchange Visitor Information System) record to IUPUI. If you have questions at any time, contact us: ischolar@iupui.edu and we will help you. If you are a Canadian citizen with a valid passport, you do not need to apply for a visa stamp. However, you do need to pay the SEVIS fee before you enter the United States . Apply for a J-1 Visa To request J-1 status for you, your hiring department at IUPUI must submit an electronic request (e-form) through Atlas . We request that your department submit the e-form at least three months before your start date to allow for OIA processing, mailing, obtaining a visa, and making flight and living arrangements. During this application process, you will also submit information about any J-2 dependents you plan to bring with you. Pay Your SEVIS Fee After you receive your SEVIS ID number and the Exchange Visitor Program Number from your program sponsor, you can pay the SEVIS fee online. If you are bringing dependents with you, you will need their SEVIS ID numbers as well. (All of you will share a program number.) You do not need to wait to receive the DS-2019(s) to pay this fee. Remember to print your online receipt. You will need it for your visa interview and visa application. Complete the Nonimmigrant Visa Application The online application includes a list of documents and information you will need. Schedule a Visa Appointment at the Nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate Do this as soon as possible, as wait times for appointments vary by country. To see how long this process takes in your country, read the Department of State’s visa wait time information . See the list of U.S. embassies and consulates to find the nearest one and schedule your appointment. Prepare Your Documentation You will be required to show several documents at your visa appointment, including: Your DS-2019 A valid passport Your SEVIS payment receipt Visa application forms Current financial documentation that lists the sources and amounts of financial support you have secured for your program, totaling at least $1,310 per month for the duration of your invitation. If you are bringing your spouse, unmarried children under the age of 21, or both, you must also show access to $666 per month for the first dependent and $562 per month for each additional dependent. Depending on what country you are from, you may also have to pay a visa fee at your appointment. Learn more » Prepare for Your Interview Because you are applying for a nonimmigrant visa, you will need to prove to the consular official that you do not intend to immigrate to the United States. In other words, you need to show that you have definite plans to return home after your IUPUI program is complete. Plan for Security Clearances The embassy or consulate may require security clearances before it will issue your J-1 visa stamp. The requirement may be because of your name, birth country, country of citizenship, field of study, or field of research. Security clearances can take two to six weeks, or more than six weeks in rare cases. Plan for these wait times when you make arrangements to travel to the United States. Enter the United States and Validate Your Program You can enter the United States up to 30 days before the start date on your DS-2019. You must arrive no later than 30 days after the start date. You have to report to the OIA upon your arrival at the IUPUI campus. You should report to us no later than 30 days after the DS-2019 start date so we can validate your program.

Some exchange visitors (EV’s) who participate in a J-1 program will be subject to the 212(e) or two-year home residency requirement. This is often indicated on your J-1 visa, or noted on your DS2019. Who Must Meet the Two-Year Home Residency Requirement? EVs become subject to the 212(e) if they meet one or more of these criteria. Government-funded exchange program The exchange visitor’s program was financed by the U.S. government or the government of the exchange visitor’s nationality or last residence. The funding could be in whole or in part, and direct or indirect. Graduate medical education or training The EV entered the United States to receive graduate medical education or training. Specialized knowledge or skill (Skills List) The EV is a national or permanent resident of a country that has deemed the EV’s field of specialized knowledge or skill to be necessary to the home country. These skills are listed on the Exchange Visitor Skills List . Restrictions If you are subject to the 212(e), you cannot: Change your status in the United States through a petition to USCIS Change to any H or L status including H-1B or L-1 principal or H-4 or L-2 dependents Immigrate to the United States (you cannot become a permanent resident) However, this does not prevent you from obtaining new visa documents and applying for a new U.S. visa at a U.S. embassy or consulate abroad. How to Meet the Requirement You can resolve the 212(e) in one of two ways: Return to your country of permanent residence when you entered the United States, and live there for two years, or Request a waiver of the requirement from both your home country’s government and the U.S. Department of State . Please note that once the U.S. Department of State has recommended the J-1 waiver and sent notification to you, to your J-1 program sponsor, and to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), we cannot extend or transfer your J-1 program. We recommend that you extend your J-1 program as far into the future as possible before obtaining your J-1 waiver approval. Please consult with OIA’s scholar services staff if you have questions about your strategy.

The bars do not affect eligibility for other J-1 categories, such as short-term scholar, specialist or student intern. 24-Month Bar If you come to the United States in the J-1 research scholar or professor categories, or as a J-2 dependent of a research scholar or professor, your J program may be extended for up to five years. Whenever your J-1 program ends (even if less than 5 years), you are ineligible to begin a new J-1 research scholar or professor program at any U.S. institution for 24 months. This is known as the 24-month bar. Note that this regulation is different from the 212(e) Two-Year Home Residency Requirement . Unlike the 212(e) this requirement can be fulfilled anywhere in the world including the U.S.  The restriction is only that you cannot have been in those two J-1 categories in the preceding two years. 12-Month Bar The 12-month bar prohibits a potential J-1 exchange visitor from beginning a new program in the research scholar or professor categories if they were in the U.S. for more than six months in any J status (including J-2 dependent) during all or part of the twelve-month period immediately preceding the start date of the new program. There are four exceptions: The 12-month bar is not applicable to those who are transferring to another institution to continue their current J-1 program. A person whose prior J status was of less than six months duration (physical presence in the U.S.) is exempt from the 12-month bar. No time spent in the short-term scholar category triggers the 12-month bar. Individuals subject to the 24-month bar are not additionally subject to the 12-month bar.

You may have plans to travel outside the country during your J-1 scholar program. You may want to speak at a convention, for example, or visit your family. Follow the tips below to ensure a smooth trip. These requirements and recommendations apply to all travel outside the United States, including trips to Canada, Mexico, and nearby islands such as Jamaica or the Bahamas. Get a Travel Signature You and any J-2 dependents must have a valid travel signature on your Form DS-2019 to re-enter the United States. Stop by the OIA to request a travel signature at least two weeks before you travel. Your IUPUI department must approve your request to travel. Then you will receive an email from OIA with further instructions. If J-2 dependents will travel with you, their DS-2019 forms must also be signed. If J-2 dependents will not travel with you, and you will be outside the country for more than 30 days, please contact us for advising . Check Your Documents Check your passport, visa, and DS-2019 to ensure that they will not expire while you are outside the country. If your passport will expire within six months, we recommend renewing it. Once you have returned to the U.S., be sure to check your I-94 information . It’s important that this information is accurate! Insure that your status was marked with ‘D/S’ on your re-entry. If not please contact the OIA immediately for assistance. Request a Visitor’s Visa, If Necessary If you are traveling to a country other than your home country, or travelling through a particular country enroute to your home country, you may need a visitor’s visa or a transit visa. To find out, visit that country’s embassy website and search for visa information for non-immigrants. Plan for Additional Wait Times If your visa expires or is only valid for a limited number of uses, you may need a new J-1 visa stamp to return to the United States. This process can take six weeks or more because of security clearances. When you make travel arrangements, you and your department should plan for the possibility of these wait times. Travel to or through Canada There are new requirements for travelling to or through Canada.  Some travelers may not need a visa but need Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) to enter or transit Canada.  Go to this page to see if you need an eTA or a visitor visa to enter Canada: http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/visas.asp You should plan that you will need one or the other. Short trips to Mexico, Canada, or islands adjacent to the United States (such as the Bahamas) You may be eligible to return from Mexico, Canada and islands adjacent to the United States even if you have an expired visa. This is generally allowable for trips of 30 days or less. It is essential that you read all eligibility criteria on the Immigration and Customs Enforcement website before you decide to use this exception. You may also refer to the information you received during orientation on this subject. Don’t forget, you need a travel signature on your DS2019 even for short trips to nearby countries! Travel After Completing your Program? OIA cannot sign your DS-2019 for travel during your post-program grace period, and you cannot re-enter in J-1 status if you depart the United States during your 30 day grace period.

There are four steps in the process. If you are a Canadian citizen with a valid passport, you do not need to apply for a visa stamp. However, you do need to pay the SEVIS fee before arriving at the port of entry. Step One: Pay Your SEVIS Fee You will have to show your payment receipt for the SEVIS fee when you arrive for your visa interview, so pay the fee right away. (If you paid the fee in the past, you may not need to pay it again, but you should still bring your receipt.) Learn more about the SEVIS fee and how to pay it and obtain your payment receipt. Step Two: Schedule a Visa Appointment at the U.S. Embassy in Your Home Country Contact the U.S. embassy/consulate nearest you as soon as possible to set up an appointment. This is important because the wait time for an appointment and for visa issuance varies. To see how long this process takes in your country, read the U.S. Department of State’s visa wait time information . It’s best to apply in your home country. If you are not sure which embassy/consulate you should contact, see this list of U.S. embassies . Step Three: Get Your Documentation Ready When you arrive for your visa appointment, you will be required to show a number of documents, including: Your DS-2019 Your valid passport A SEVIS payment receipt printed from your online payment confirmation Visa application forms Current financial documentation that lists the sources and amounts of financial support you have secured for the current or upcoming academic year. It must match the information listed on your DS-2019. Students renewing their visa should also bring: A Letter of Good Standing, which may be requested through Atlas . A copy of your unofficial transcript, printed out from One.iu.edu (search for \"Unofficial Transcript\") . A copy of the EAD card and proof of employment (Students on OPT only). The embassy’s website will list other specific documents that you should bring. Step Four: Prepare for Your Interview Since you are applying for a nonimmigrant visa, you will need to prove to the consular officer that you do not intend to immigrate to the United States. In other words, you need to show him or her that you have definite plans to return home after your program at IUPUI has finished. For more information and tips, please see NAFSA’s Ten Points to Remember . Applying for a Visa in Canada or Mexico If you intend to apply for a new U.S. visa in Canada or Mexico and are not a citizen or resident of either country, contact an advisor at the Office of International Affairs. Additionally, it is important for you to read the U.S. Department of State’s guidance on Applying for Visas in Canada or Mexico . Are you in the U.S. in another visa status and need to change to J-1 status instead? It may be possible to change to J-1 status, but there is a specific process you must complete. Contact an advisor to learn how » What is the difference between a visa and visa status? A visa is a stamp in your passport that allows you to request permission to enter the United States. Your visa status is the immigration category that you were granted when you entered the U.S., such as F-1, J-1, H-4, etc. You need to maintain your visa status in order to stay in the United States—and we will help you do that.

The J-2 visa is for a dependent spouse or an unmarried child who is under the age of 21. J-2 status enables dependents to stay in the United States during the J-1 students’s program. Funding Documentation J-1 students must prove that they have financial support to fund their dependents in J-2 status. You should be prepared to document $8400 for your first dependent and $5075 for each subsequent dependent. A J-1 student bringing 3 family members, for example, would need to show $18,550 in addition to the J-1 student's program estimate. Requesting J-2 Dependent Documents Dependent documents can be requested in two ways: as part of the admissions process or once the J-1 student has arrived to the US. If you plan to bring your family with you at the beginning of your study, you should submit your dependent documents and funding during your admission process. If you plan to bring your dependents to the United States after you have already begun your study, you will need to request documents from your Atlas account.

On campus employment refers to any job on campus in which you are paid by Indiana University. Exceptions to the “paid by IU” requirement exist for businesses that operate on campus for the purpose of serving students. One example is the Barnes and Noble bookstore. Another is Chartwells Campus Dining. Jobs paid by IU Health are not considered on-campus employment. If your DS-2019 is not issued through OIA, you must contact your program sponsor to find out if you can apply for on campus work. How do I get authorization to work on campus? To request and receive your work authorization, please log in to Atlas and submit the “J-1 On-Campus Work Authorization” e-form under J-1 Student Services. Please be aware that working without proper authorization is a violation of J-1 status, and may result in the loss of benefits of your J-1 program. Please remember to submit your request at least 5 days before you need to begin working. On campus employment may only be authorized for up to 12 months at a time. You must apply and receive authorization for each 12-month period, or for the duration of your assistantship, fellowship, or on campus job—whichever is shorter. Authorization is specific to a job. If anything about your job changes, you will need to apply for authorization again. The possible types of on-campus employment are assistantship (research assistantship/graduate assistantship/associate instructorship), fellowship or scholarship that requires employment, or any other on campus work (libraries, campus dining halls, etc.). What are the rules I must follow to be legally employed? You must: Enroll as a full-time student during the fall and spring semesters. Work no more than 20 hours per week during the fall and spring semesters. Work full time only during official university breaks (summer break, winter break and spring break). Your 20-hour weekly maximum is a combined total for all on campus jobs you have. Hours may not be averaged over a period of time. If you wish to work more than 20 hours and the work is in your major field of study and is an integral/critical part of your academic program, please see Academic Training . Where can I find a job? The Office of Student Employment is your best source for assistance in finding an on campus job. On their website, you will find Jagjobs, which is an online listing of available jobs. In addition to using Jagjobs, you should visit campus offices to inquire about any open positions and deliver your resume. The Office of Student Employment provides workshops and resources about resume writing, interview skills, networking, and many other employment-related topics. I found a job! What do I do now?

To maintain your legal J-1 status in the U.S., you must be enrolled full-time each fall and spring semester. You do not have to enroll in summer sessions unless you begin your program of study at IUPUI in the summer. Full-time enrollment requirements include: Undergraduates must enroll in at least 12 credit hours each fall and spring semester. Graduate students must enroll in at least 8 credits hours each fall and spring semester. Professional students (Dentistry, MD, JD) should follow full-time enrollment requirements as determined by their academic programs. Dropping below full-time enrollment without authorization from OIA is a serious violation of your J-1 status! Read about full-time exceptions and procedures» Concurrent Enrollment at Another School You may take courses at another school that will count towards your full-time enrollment requirement at IUPUI. However, you must: Maintain at least one regular (not online) course at IUPUI. Report your concurrent enrollment using the Concurrent Enrollment Notification form in Atlas . Consult with an academic advisor to make sure any courses you take at another school will transfer to IUPUI and count towards your degree program. Online Enrollment Online courses cannot count towards your full-time enrollment requirement. You should enroll full-time in courses requiring in-person attendance. Once the full-time enrollment requirement has been reached, online courses may be added if you wish. If you are a sponsored student, be aware that your sponsor may have rules prohibiting online enrollment. Classes that count as “in-person” are coded as: P, HY, IN and IS. As you plan your future enrollment, make sure you are following this normal guidance. Flexibility on online enrollment that was allowed during the COVID pandemic ended in May 2023. Incomplete Courses Incomplete courses from a previous semester may not count towards your full-time enrollment for a current semester. Additionally, you may not use incomplete courses to extend your program. For J-1 status purposes, your program will be considered completed at the end of your final semester, even if you have an incomplete course. Enrollment Deadline Students must be enrolled full time or have received permission to under enroll prior to the full-time enrollment deadline. Each fall and spring semester the full-time enrollment deadline is 30 days after the first day of classes. Are you sponsored by your government or other agency? Your sponsor may limit the amount of online or hybrid courses you are allowed to take. Make sure to check with your sponsor before registering for any online or hybrid course work to prevent a large bill that your sponsor will not pay.

In these cases where a student is enrolled in a designated full-time equivalency course, OIA approval is not required. Final Semester of Study When you are in your final semester of degree study, this option permits you to register for only the credits necessary to complete the degree requirements.

As you get ready to complete your program of study, you can: Apply for Academic Training (AT) so you can work in the United States. Applications for AT can only be submitted to the Office of International Affairs (OIA) before your completion date. See the J-1 Employment section for more information. Apply for a change of status. If you are not subject to the two-year foreign residency requirement [212(e)], you are eligible to apply to change your nonimmigrant status. USCIS must receive the application before the end of your grace period. Find out if you are subject to this requirement by looking at your J-1 visa stamp. Transfer to a new school. You must request a “ Transfer Out ” of your SEVIS record via Atlas . You will need to have your transfer out approved by the OIA before the end of your grace period. Your new school must provide you with a new DS-2019 within 30 days of the date your program is officially transferred to the new school. Start a new program of study at IUPUI. You must be fully admitted and have received a new DS-2019 from the OIA before the end of the grace period. Updated financial documentation will be required to issue the new DS-2019. You can make your request for a new degree program by setting up an appointment with one of the advisors. Leave the United States before the end of your grace period. Program Completion and Your J-1 Status If you are an undergraduate student, or a graduate student in a coursework-only program, your completion date will be the last day of final exams during the term in which you complete your degree requirements. If you are a graduate student writing a thesis or dissertation, your completion date will be either: The last day of final exams in the last semester or summer term of your enrollment when you are submitting your thesis or dissertation; or The last day of the month if you are in an Indiana University-based degree program that allows monthly thesis or dissertation deposits and does monthly conferrals and you are submitting your thesis or dissertation earlier than the last month of the semester or summer term. If you are a graduate student in a program with a required cumulative examination that is required for degree completion/conferral, your completion date would be the day of that required cumulative examination. Please note: incomplete courses do not extend your program completion to a new semester. If you have incomplete courses in your final semester, or are concerned you might have incomplete courses, please contact OIA immediately for assistance. Your eligibility to work on campus ends upon completion of your program of study. Your Post-Completion Grace Period Federal regulations provide you with a 30-day grace period that starts the day you complete your program of study. For example, if you complete your program of study on May 4, your grace period ends on June 3 regardless of the expiration date on your DS-2019. If you have not made other plans, you must depart the country by the end of your grace period. Travel After Completing your Program If you plan to travel to Canada or anywhere else outside of the United States during your grace period, the OIA will not be able to sign your DS-2019 for travel. If you travel outside of the country, you will NOT be able to re-enter the United States as a J-1 student, because you have completed your program. You may be able to re-enter the United States as a tourist. Discuss your plans with us before you travel; see an advisor during Walk-in Advising Hours. Dependent Status After Completing Your Program If you have J-2 dependents with you in the United States, their status is dependent upon yours. If you choose to leave the country after you complete your program of study, your family members may not legally stay in the United States without you if they hold J-2 status. Departure Checklists University Obligations If you received any wages from IUPUI during the previous year, be sure to inform the human resources administrator in your Department of your plans for departure. Update One.iu.edu with your new mailing address, phone number, and email address. Return any borrowed books or other materials to the library. Pay any remaining balance on your bursar account in One.iu.edu . Your diploma and official transcripts will not be released until your balance is fully paid. Immigration Obligations Organize a file with copies of all visa and immigration documents pertaining to your stay in the US so that you can access them again in the future. Examples of visa documents include: passport, visa, I-94, DS-2019 forms, I-797 approval notices, and EAD cards. OIA does not archive copies of documents for more than 5 years beyond your departure. If you have a child who was born in the US, visit the State Department website here how to get a US passport for your child. Your child will need a US passport to return to the US in the future. If you have a small, white paper I-94 card, when you depart the US, be sure to turn in that I-94 card. Usually, it will be collected by an airline official. Failure to submit this card upon your exit may result in future travel difficulties. If you have an electronic I-94, then you do not need to take any special actions. Financial Obligations If you received wages from IUPUI or another employer during the calendar year, you will need to file a tax return the following spring. You will need to obtain your W-2 form from your employer. This form contains the data that you will use to complete a U.S. tax return. Please remember that even though you are not in the U.S., you are required to file a tax return on all U.S.-based income. This becomes especially important if you owe the U.S. government taxes. This debt will keep accruing interest until it is addressed. OIA can give you general information on filing individual tax returns . Notify your bank of your departure plans. If you have been working or have scheduled payments from your bank account, determine if you will need to leave your account open beyond your departure date to allow for pending transactions. Work with the bank to determine the best way to handle the closure of your account or options for maintaining a U.S. account indefinitely after you relocate abroad. Determine if you have any outstanding bills with credit card companies, auto or renter's insurance companies, or other organizations. If you are unable to pay them off before departing, contact the organization to make arrangements for payment. Housing & Related Issues Notify your landlord of your intended departure date. (Check your lease to determine how much advance notice is required and if there are any penalties for leaving before your lease is finished.) Ask if there are any procedures that you must follow.

It is critical that you stay in legal status. If you fall out of status, you are no longer in the United States legally. If that happens, you could have serious problems with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). You could compromise your ability to get a U.S. visa or even enter the United States in the future. You must also be in status to receive employment authorization . OIA is happy to provide you with the information and advice you need to maintain your status. However, maintaining your status is your responsibility. How to Maintain Your J-1 Student Status It is essential to check your IUPUI email regularly. If you do not, you could miss communications that are important to maintaining your status. Maintain a Valid DS-2019 Do not let your DS-2019 expire. If necessary, you can request an extension using Atlas. However, if your DS-2019 was issued by another sponsor (not IUPUI), you will need to process your extension through them. You will also need a new DS-2019 if you change your degree level, major, funding source, or the number of J-2 dependents you have. Making these changes can sometimes be difficult. Be sure to contact an OIA advisor to discuss your plans before you take any action. Get Your DS-2019 Signed Before You Travel Make sure you have a valid travel signature for yourself and your dependents before traveling outside the United States. To get one, make a request in Atlas at least two weeks before you leave. Enroll Full-Time To stay in status, you need to enroll in a full load of classes each fall and spring semester. Undergraduate students must enroll in at least 12 credit hours each semester. Most graduate students must enroll in at least 8 credit hours. There are exceptions to this rule . Work Only With Authorization In nearly all cases, you must receive authorization from either OIA or your J-1 Program Sponsor before you begin working. Learn more about your employment options » Keep Your Address Updated You must update your address within 10 days of any move, even if it is only temporary. Learn more about changes of address » Keep a Valid Passport You must have a valid passport at all times. If your passport will expire while you are in the United States, you need to contact your embassy to find out how to renew it. Abide by Grace Periods You have a 30-day grace period following the completion of your J-1 student program or Academic Training (AT). You can use this time to take care of personal matters and/or travel around the United States. If you are not subject to the two-year home residence requirement, you can also apply for a different immigration status during your grace period. You are required to depart the United States by the end of your grace period if you have not taken other action to extend your stay.

This can occur when you are currently enrolled as a student at IUPUI in J-1 status and plan to enroll at another university. Or it can be done if you wish to have your J-1 sponsorship transferred to another Exchange Visitor program, such as IIE. When the transfer process is completed, IUPUI will no longer be your program sponsor. How to Transfer your SEVIS Record from IUPUI to a New Program Sponsor Log in to Atlas using your university technology account username and passphrase. In the J-1 Student Services menu, select “Transfer Out Request” Complete this e-form. Pay special attention to the date you are requesting that OIA release your SEVIS record to your new sponsor. As of that date, your SEVIS record will belong to your new school and you will no longer have work authorization granted by IUPUI. Before you can submit the e-form, you will be prompted to upload a copy of your admission letter to your new program sponsor or institution. OIA can only transfer your SEVIS record to one institution even though you may be applying to many. Complete the “Transfer Out Request” only after you are certain you want your record transferred to a new program sponsor. Transfer Guidelines for Specific Situations You have completed (or will complete) your program at IUPUI and will begin a new program at a new institution. You must request your SEVIS transfer and the release must be granted within the 30 days following the completion of your IUPUI program. You have completed your program at IUPUI and are pursuing Academic Training and you will begin a new program of study at the conclusion of your Academic Training period. Your Academic Training will end on the date that your SEVIS record is released to your new sponsor. Academic Training is not transferable. If you intend to have your SEVIS record transferred after your Academic Training ends, you will need to request and receive the SEVIS transfer during the 30 days following the completion of your Academic Training period. You are currently attending IUPUI, have not (and will not) complete a degree program, and wish to transfer your SEVIS record to another school. You should request your record to be transferred after your last day of study at IUPUI but before the next term begins. For example: You are studying for a master degree at IUPUI and wish to transfer to another school after your first year. You should request your SEVIS release from IUPUI after your last final exam in May but before your semester begins at your new school in August. Please be aware, if you are working on-campus at IUPUI, you will no longer have authorization to do so on the day you request your SEVIS record to be released. Getting Your New DS-2019 Once your SEVIS record has been transferred to your new sponsor, they will be able to make a new DS-2019 for you. Be sure to contact your new sponsor to find out what their policy on issuing new DS-2019s is. Remember, if you are traveling outside the United States after your record has been transferred to your new sponsor, you must use your new DS-2019 to re-enter the U.S. No matter what your travel plans are, you must report to your new sponsor within 15 days of your new DS-2019 start date. Things to Know about Transferring your SEVIS Record A SEVIS transfer applies only to your immigration documentation and DS-2019. Academic records are not included in this process. Please review the timing information above carefully. Your SEVIS transfer release date will be the day you complete your program, the final day of your last semester at IUPUI or a date you specify in your Transfer Out Request—whichever is later. If you decide to cancel your transfer, you must notify us in writing before your transfer release date. After that date, we will no longer have access to your SEVIS record. In addition, all travel and employment benefits authorized through IUPUI will end on your transfer release date. For assistance or more detailed information, contact iadvisor@iupui.edu .

We are here to provide information and services to ensure that you are aware of these requirements and are able to remain compliant. Maintaining contact with OIA and reading your IUPUI email regularly throughout your time here will help ensure you stay in status. See Maintaining Status for more information. If you are not compliant with regulations, we may be forced by law to terminate your SEVIS record. Termination of a SEVIS record is very serious and can have many negative consequences for you. It can end your ability to stay in the United States, attend school, and apply for work authorization. SEVIS termination means that you are not in legal status (\"out of status\") according to the Department of Homeland Security. If you are out of status, contact us to learn about your options. Staying in the U.S. beyond your allowable grace period is also a violation of J-1 regulations. If your SEVIS (or DS-2019) is terminated OR you overstay your grace period, you could be accruing unlawful presence. This can lead to arrest and deportation proceedings. Accruing unlawful presence may result in being barred from the U.S. for many years or even permanently. Important Concepts Unlawful Presence The period of time when you are in the U.S. without being admitted or paroled or when you are not in a \"period of stay authorized by the secretary.\" Barred from Entry Being barred from the U.S. means that you cannot enter the U.S. in any immigration status for a specified length of time. You can receive a 3-year or 10-year bar from the U.S. if you have more than 180 days or one year of unlawful presence, respectively. Accrual of Unlawful Presence Accrual means adding to, accumulating, obtaining, or growing. This means you accumulate or grow days of unlawful presence each and every day beyond your status violation or end of your lawful grace period. Reasons for the termination of a SEVIS Record include: Unauthorized employment (employment without advanced authorization from OIA or USCIS) Unauthorized withdrawal from classes (dropping all your classes without advance permission from OIA) Unauthorized drop below full course of study (dropping below full time enrollment without advance authorization from OIA) Expulsion and suspension Failure to enroll in classes Enrollment in online classes Not maintaining health insurance that meets regulatory requirements In most cases, the termination of your SEVIS record means that you must make plans to immediately depart from the United States. In other words, there is no grace period after termination. If your SEVIS record is terminated, contact us to schedule an appointment immediately. Days of unlawful presence begin when your SEVIS record is terminated, unless your international student advisor has indicated a grace period for departure from the U.S. Staying after any grace period will also result in days of unlawful presence. If you have an J-2 spouse or children, they will also begin accruing days of unlawful presence if your SEVIS record is terminated. J-2 dependents can also violate status separately from your J-1 status. This will also result in your dependents accruing days of unlawful presence and perhaps a being barred from entry to the U.S. We do not know what the future impact of even one or two days of unlawful presence will be if you wish to apply for a new visa stamp or submit an application or petition to USCIS (for example, if a future employer wishes to sponsor you for an H1-B status). Even a few days of unlawful presence could cause you to be ineligible for this type of future status. The Best Ways to Ensure That You Stay in Legal Status Check your IUPUI email at least once per day Always stay enrolled full time Contact your OIA advisor before you drop any courses Do not break any university rules or U.S. laws Request authorization from OIA before you begin working (on or off campus) Do not let your DS-2019 expire Academic Advisor Resources Departmental Hiring & Hosting F-1 Students H-1B Specialty Workers J-1 Scholars J-1 Students Employment Enrollment Maintaining Status Applying for a Visa Dependents of J-1 Students Completing Your Program Local Address SEVIS Fee J-1 SEVIS Transfer from IUPUI Travel Outside the U.S. SEVIS Violations Permanent Residence Taxes & Social Security Numbers DACA and Undocumented Student Information Immigration Updates Office of International Affairs social media channels Twitter Facebook Instagram YouTube Copyright © 2023 The Trustees of Indiana University , Copyright Complaints Accessibility | Privacy Notice"

SEVIS stands for the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System. It maintains current information on nonimmigrant students, exchange visitors, and their dependents (i.e., all those in F or J status). As an J-1 student, you will be assigned a SEVIS number, and a SEVIS record will be created for you. SEVIS will track you from the time you receive your DS-2019 until you complete your program. The Office of International Affairs is responsible for updating your SEVIS record. We are required to report: Full-time enrollment Failure to enroll Dropping below a full-time course load without prior authorization Any other failure to maintain student status or complete program A change in legal name or address Your graduation if it occurs prior to the expected program end date Start date of your next session Transfers Program extensions Off-campus employment authorization Any other major changes to your program For J-1 students, the SEVIS fee is $180 unless you are participating in a federally sponsored exchange program.

You have a DS-2019 issued by the U.S. government. Paying the SEVIS Fee You can pay the SEVIS fee online or by mail. We recommend paying online, because it is the fastest method. It can be paid by you or by a third party, from inside or outside the United States. No matter which method you choose, your payment must be accompanied by Form I-901. Remember that paying the SEVIS fee is only the first step of the visa application process , so get it done as soon as possible. If you are a J-1 student with a country of citizenship or country of birth of Cameroon, The Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, or Nigeria, you must pay by money order, Western Union Quick Pay, or certified check drawn from a U.S. bank. To Pay the SEVIS Fee Online: Go to the SEVIS fee processing site. Complete Form I-901 online (be sure to insert your name exactly as it appears on your I-20) and supply the necessary MasterCard, Visa, or American Express credit card information. Print a copy of the online receipt. We suggest that you keep a copy of your receipt with your other important immigration documents. To Pay the SEVIS Fee by Western Union Quick Pay: Complete Form I-901 at FMJFee.com . You will get a unique payment coupon number, necessary to validate and process your payment at Western Union. You cannot submit a SEVIS fee payment via Western Union without this coupon number. Print a copy of the payment coupon and take it to your local Western Union office. Fill out the Quick Collect/Quick Pay Form according to the information found at the bottom of the printed coupon. Present the coupon and your payment to the Western Union agent for processing. A copy of instructions and sample forms can be viewed at and printed from the SEVP website . Frequently Asked Questions Will the Department of Homeland Security keep a record of my payment on file? Fee payments should be entered into your permanent immigration (SEVIS) record, but it is strongly recommended that you retain a copy of your fee receipt to use as needed. I applied to more than one school and have more than one DS-2019 form. What happens if I pay the SEVIS fee for one school and then change my mind and decide that I want to attend a different school? Is my paid SEVIS fee transferrable? Yes, the SEVIS fee is transferable. But you must take the DS-2019 form with the SEVIS ID number that you listed on the I-901 form to the U.S. consulate/embassy, in addition to the I-20 form from the school you wish to attend. Be sure to make your intentions clear to the Consular Officer. For more information, see these SEVIS I-901 Fee FAQs » What if my J-1 visa application is denied? The SEVIS fee will not be refunded.

OIA is maintaining frequently updated information regarding COVID-19 Travel Restrictions on our website . You can also keep informed about Indiana University and IUPUI's response to COVID-19 here. While you are studying at IUPUI you may want to travel outside the United States: To return to your home country over summer break To explore another country on spring break To participate in a study abroad program But, before you pack your luggage, there are some steps you need to take to protect your J-1 status. DS-2019 Requirements for Traveling Outside the United States Get a Travel Signature on your DS-2019 Before you leave the country, make sure you have a valid travel signature from an OIA advisor or your program sponsor on your DS-2019. You will not be able to re-enter the United States without one. To get a travel signature, make a request through Atlas at least two weeks before you plan to travel. Travel signatures are valid for one calendar year or until the completion of your program, whichever comes first. Once you have returned to the U.S., be sure to check your I-94 information . It’s important that this information is accurate! Make Sure Your DS-2019 Reflects Your Current Situation If there have been any changes in your situation (for example, if you have changed your major, degree level, or source/s of financial support) that are not indicated on your current DS-2019, you will need to get a new one. For changes in major or source/s of funding, request a travel signature through Atlas and note the changes in the “Note any Special Requests” section. You may be asked to provide updated financial documents. For a change in major or degree level, you will need to set up a time to speak with one of the international student advisors. Please contact the OIA front desk to make an appointment. In this case, you do not need to request a travel signature. When your new degree program request is approved, a new DS-2019 will be printed and will be valid for travel. Timing can be critical for these changes, so start the process early. In most cases, updated financial documentation will be required to process your new DS-2019. Make Sure Your DS-2019 Will Not Expire While You Are Out of the Country Check the completion date in section 3 of your DS-2019 to see whether it is about to expire. If it expires while you are outside the U.S., you will not be able to re-enter the U.S. If your DS-2019 is about to expire and you have not yet completed your program, you will need to apply for an “Extension of Program” through Atlas . You do not need to make a separate request for a travel signature. When your extension is approved, a new DS-2019 will be printed and signed for travel. If IUPUI is not your sponsor, please discuss your extension needs with your program sponsor contact. Updated financial documentation will be required to process your I-20 extension. Make Sure Your Visa is Valid Is the J-1 visa stamp in your passport valid beyond the date you plan to re-enter the United States? If not, you must apply for a new visa stamp while you are abroad. Read about renewing your visa ›› Travel to Countries Other Than Your Home Country If you are traveling to a country other than your home country, you may need a visitor or transit visa. To find out, visit that country’s embassy website at Foreign Embassies of Washington, D.C. , and search for the consular section nearest you. If you are traveling to the European Union, and your home country is not within the European Union, you may apply for the Schengen Visa , which permits travel within E.U. countries. For the latest travel advisories, visit the U.S. Department of State’s website . Traveling to or through Canada? Canada now requires Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) for many citizens of visa-exempt countries who enter or transit through Canada. This means that you may need to apply for authorization even if you are only changing flights in Canada. Learn more on the Canadian Immigration & Citizenship website » Short trips to Mexico, Canada, or islands adjacent to the United States (such as the Bahamas) You may be eligible to return from Mexico, Canada and islands adjacent to the United States even if you have an expired visa. This is generally allowable for trips of 30 days or less. It is essential that you read all eligibility criteria on the Immigration and Customs Enforcement website before you decide to use this exception. Don’t forget, you need a travel signature on your I-20 even for short trips to nearby countries! Traveling after completing your program? OIA cannot sign your DS-2019 for travel during your post-graduation grace period, and you cannot re-enter in J-1 status if you depart the United States.

Providing instructions on how to proceed. Facilitating the process of engaging outside legal counsel when necessary through approved mechanisms. Full assistance with the immigrant process is provided by OIS for teaching faculty where actual classroom teaching is involved and for employees who qualify as Outstanding Researchers or Professors. Teaching faculty positions can become eligible for a unique permanent residence pathway. Departments hiring teaching faculty should review our guidance for posting the open position. If you qualify as a teaching faculty, it is very important that you initiate your permanent resident process with OIS within 15 months of receiving the offer letter for your faculty position . For most other positions, IU policies require that you be employed at the University for at least one year before qualifying for sponsorship for permanent residence. For academic and professional positions with no required classroom responsibility, the position must be considered permanent with at least three years of secure funding to be eligible for IU employment-based permanent residence. Positions designated “post-doctoral” are not considered permanent positions. To initiate the permanent resident process on your behalf, your department contact will first need to request access to Atlas . Then they will complete the e-form request for permanent residence from the Atlas portal. Scholars are free to submit their own self-petitioned cases for permanent residence including National Interest Waiver and Alien of Extraordinary Ability without the assistance or oversight of IU. Permanent Residence Based on \"Marriage to a U.S. Citizen\" If you marry a U.S. citizen, you may be eligible to apply to become a permanent resident and get a green card. You will apply to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. You may prepare your application before you get married, but you must provide proof of your marriage as part of the application process. The application for permanent residence based on marriage has many components. This application is a self-petition. OIS can provide general information to you about the process. Process to Apply Permanent residence via marriage is a complicated subject. OIS will explain some of the details to you.

This is especially true for the life-saving work of entomology that often goes under the radar of humanitarian causes. Mosquitoes kill an estimated one million people annually, making them a threat to nations throughout the tropics, and especially the Caribbean, Africa, and parts of Asia. This makes research scientists like the late-great Professor Dave Chadee, affectionately known as Mosquito Man for his groundbreaking research, real-life superheroes for tackling this humanitarian crisis. In that spirit, scholars from all over the world have partnered with IU and IUPUI to address this global health emergency. One such scholar is Dr. Keshava Mysore , Assistant Research Professor in the lab of Dr. Molly Duman Scheel , the Navari Family Professor in the Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics at the IU School of Medicine - South Bend. Speaking about how he got involved in Mosquito research, Dr. Mysore explains: “My graduate work was on ants. I was interested in ant neurology and how did ants become ants. I transitioned to mosquitoes during my first post doc in Basel, Switzerland. Working alone I was able to ask innovative questions. However, when I was able to collaborate with others doing mosquito research at the University of Notre Dame and IUSM-South Bend, I was able to join a larger community to conduct research in mosquito genetics and to apply this in novel ways for mosquito larval and adult population control.” Only a small percent of the 3500 known mosquito species actually carries malaria and other blood-borne illnesses. What makes these tiny carriers so invasive is their tenacity, the late Dr. Chadee relayed that there is a species of mosquito whose proboscis can penetrate denim! Combine this with vulnerable environments where mosquitos and humans interact according to climate, season, and generally inadequate housing that does not offer much in way of protection from mosquito-human contact, and you have our current crisis. Climate change is exacerbating the situation, the flooded conditions left behind by hurricanes and other tropical storms represent ideal breeding grounds for mosquitos. These are the sociopolitical obstacles that our scholars are hoping to address. Dr. Duman Scheel’s lab at IU School of Medicine - South Bend has become a nexus for research scientists interested in medical entomology (study of insects) . Dr. Scheel explains that she saw the international collaborative model she uses and emulates from a colleague at UC-Irvine. “They brought in people from around the world and then they returned to their countries. They know the culture and the networks and can use that background with their scientific experiences to make real scientific advancements. My international trainees inspire me.” These translational research scholars plan to apply the insights gained to pressing insect-borne pathologies from around the world. Dr. Duman Scheel’s lab uses an integrated holistic approach to mosquito control. The lab is modifying yeast to include environmentally safe RNA-based pesticides. It enables them to target specific mosquito species while preserving the biodiversity of the environment. This fits well with Mosquito Man’s legacy of finding alternatives to the harmful side effects of traditional insecticides. Dr. Duman Scheel and colleague, Dr. David Severson, Professor Emeritus, Notre Dame , fondly recall working in the field with Dr. Chadee in the Caribbean. This collaboration was also where international scholar, Akilah Stewart , first began research on their local projects. Dr. Stewart completed her Ph.D. in environmental biology at the University of West Indies where she was also mentored by the Mosquito Man . Dr. Stewart’s hope is to bring her research into microbial diversity in water sources and yeast cultivation to the lab’s collaborative research for further field work and lab-based inquiry. These steps forward excite Dr. Longhua Sun , an international scholar from China. Dr. Sun originally worked with Dr. Duman Scheel’s father, Dr. John Duman, at the University of Notre Dame and is now a research technician in Dr. Scheel’s lab. She affirms that it excites her to see that the work they do here has a possibility of influencing the world. Dr. Majidah Hamid-Adiamoh , a scholar from Nigeria, is similarly motivated. Dr. Hamid-Adiamoh saw a postdoctoral opening for the Scheel lab posted on Twitter and decided to apply. Working on her Ph.D. in Ghana, she studied molecular biology of infectious pathogens and has combined that with the genetic component of resistance to insecticides for vector control. She saw a gap in the need to develop novel tools for vector control and now in Molly’s lab, she is building skills in the technology to achieve this. Dr. Hamid-Adiamoh echoed the earlier sentiments of Dr. Duman Scheel : “Working in this laboratory gives me the confidence that we can work [together] to eradicate malaria.” Finally, there is Dr. Teresia Njoroge who came from Kenya to pursue a Ph.D. in Entomology at the University of Illinois. Her research is centered around mosquito ecology and control. Her interest in translational research led her to also applying for a postdoc position in the Duman Scheel lab. She also hopes to use mosquito genetics and molecular biology to develop environmentally safe insecticides for mosquito control. She is involved in making the yeast-based insecticides and testing their potential to kill mosquitoes in the lab. She recently travelled to Tanzania to help with setting up semi-field trials using the yeast-based insecticides for mosquito control and hopes to apply these insights to her home country of Kenya. This is a huge step forward in mosquito research. Working on insect-borne disease can become a life passion when it is fueled by scientific innovations and by researchers organically connected to the people most affected. The tremendous work of Dr. Duman Scheel and Dr. Severson is inspiring a new generation of international scholars who will better the world one scientific breakthrough at a time.

Forms and information are available through the U.S. Federal Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Indiana Department of Revenue (INDOR). If you worked in a state other than Indiana in 2022, you may need to file income tax returns in that state as well. Do I have to pay taxes? All international persons living in the U.S. are required to comply with the U.S. requirement to file federal and state income tax “returns” and pay any required taxes by April 18, 2023, for any U.S. income received in 2022.  If you paid any taxes in error, filing a U.S. and Indiana State tax return is the only way to receive a refund of these taxes. I made no U.S. income. Do I have to do anything? If you made no U.S. income in 2022, you still must complete form 8843 if you were in the U.S. in 2022 and are still here. The instructions for completing form 8843 can be found here . Do I need any forms to complete my tax return? You cannot complete your tax forms until you have received a report of the previous year's income.  This is generally reported on form W-2 or 1042-S.  IU employees received the W-2 in late January.  The 1042-S is typically prepared and sent by IU’s tax office in February. If you received additional income—say as an independent contractor—you may receive a 1099MISC. It is common to not receive all of these forms, only those appropriate for your tax situation. If you are a non-resident for tax purposes, you will be able to use Sprintax to prepare your federal tax return. Sprintax will help you complete form 1040NR and form 8843. Sprintax will enable you to compile all forms of U.S. income regardless of the type of form the income was reported on. You can prepare your federal tax return with Sprintax for free by entering a discount code (found in the Insurance and Finances menu in Atlas ) in the \"Review your order\" page in Sprintax.

Tax Resident or Nonresident? Residency for tax purposes is not always the same as your visa residency status Residency for tax purposes is determined by The length of time you have lived in the U.S. Your visa status. You may be considered a resident for tax purposes even though you have a temporary visa status. See the specific rules by visa type to determine your residency status: F-1 and J-1 Students Generally for F-1 and J-1 students, you are a nonresident for tax purposes for 5 calendar years.  Note that the year that you enter the U.S. in this visa status counts as your first year even if you were here only a portion of that year.  After your 5 th calendar year in the United States you become a resident for tax purposes. We recommend you work through the initial steps of the Sprintax process to confirm your tax residency so you can correctly file your taxes. J-1 Scholars Generally J-1 scholars are nonresidents for tax purposes for their first two calendar years.  The year that you enter the U.S. in J-1 status is your first year even if you were here only a portion of that year.  After your second calendar year in the United States you become a resident for tax purposes.  We recommend you work through the initial steps of the Sprintax process to confirm your tax residency so you can correctly file your taxes.  Note that if your country of tax residency has a 365-day tax treaty, you may be able to claim those exemptions even once you are a resident for tax purposes. H-1Bs, O-1s, and TNs Generally if you were here for more than 183 days of the tax year in H-1B, O-1, or TN status you will be a resident for tax purposes. You will need to take the IRS’ substantial presence test to determine your tax residency. It is possible that you will be considered a “dual status resident.” The best source for information about Dual Status residency is from the IRS publication 519 \"U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens.\" It can be downloaded from the IRS website . Also consider utilizing the tax resources on the Sprintax portal. If you are a nonresident , you can use the Sprintax software to complete your taxes. If you determine that you are a resident for tax purposes, you will need to complete the tax forms for U.S. residents—such as the IRS form 1040. You may also take advantage of tax software for residents, such as TurboTax or H&R Block basic tax software. Online tax programs are being offered free of charge through the IRS website to encourage electronic filing. If you or your dependents did not receive any income, you only need to submit form 8843 for yourself and all the members of your family. Instructions to fill the form are available here . If you need additional help, you can hire a tax preparer. Resident tax forms are available from the IRS website.

Visiting students and scholars have lost significant amounts of money because of fraudulent scams, especially through phone calls from unethical individuals pretending to represent government agencies. In general, as you are going about your daily life following US laws and IUPUI policies, you should be suspicious of persons who contact you claiming that you are in trouble for some action that you have done, or will be in trouble if you don’t immediately take a particular action. Steps you can take to guard against fraud : Keep your social security card in a secure place at home. Be cautious about giving your full social security number over the phone, especially if you did not initiate the interaction; never send it by email or text. Do not give anyone login information for any online accounts. Do not let anyone claiming to be a US government official pressure you to make wire transfers, purchase gift cards, or pay them with digital currency. Be cautiously skeptical about phone numbers and email addresses claiming to represent government agencies; check to see if the email address seems “ phishy .” If you are concerned that someone calling you is pretending to be a government official, ask for their name and title and inform them you will contact the agency through official channels, such as the phone number published on an official government website. Examples of a business or government transaction that would legitimately require your social security number: Filing an immigration benefit application Engaging in employment Filing a tax return Applying for a driver’s license Opening a bank account Applying for a line of credit Renting an apartment or applying for a mortgage Applying for a professional license Enrolling in health insurance or accessing medical care Review the Social Security , USCIS , and the USA.gov webpages for more tips about avoiding scams.

SSNs can be useful for international students and scholars; however, you must have a job offer in order to apply for one. Do you have a scholarship with a service component that is paid directly to your Bursar account? Examples include the International Peer Mentoring Program, Sam H. Jones Community Service Scholarships, and the Bepko Learning Center’s academic mentoring programs. If you have this type of scholarship, you probably do not qualify for a Social Security Number. If your scholarship award/s each semester exceeds the value of your tuition, please contact our office. For tax purposes, anyone receiving income must provide their employer with a Social Security number. If you want to get an SSN, you must apply in person at the local Social Security Administration office . Social Security Administration (SSA) The Social Security Administration office closest to the IUPUI campus is their downtown location: 575 N Pennsylvania Street, Room 685 Indianapolis, Indiana 46202 Phone: 1-866-592-2812 You may find other SSA locations as well as office hours on the Social Security Administration website . Be aware, you only get one SSN for your lifetime. Though the card you get with your number printed on it will look fairly flimsy, this piece of identification is very important. Keep your SSN private and do not share your SSN via email (this often leads to identity theft). Keep your social security card in a safe place with the rest of your immigration documents. Standard Documents All international persons must show the following documents to complete an application: Valid passport I-20, DS-2019 or other document indicating non-immigrant/immigrant status A copy of your I-94 record One other piece of identification – a student ID card, driver’s license, credit card, etc. Additional Materials Required: F-1 and J-1 Students with On-Campus Hourly Jobs or Student Academic Appointments All F-1/J-1 students need to submit the standard documents listed above. Also, F-1/J-1 students need a letter from the department offering employment. The letter should follow the format in this sample employer letter , and be printed on the department’s original letterhead. In addition, students need to provide a letter from International Affairs. Students can fill out the Social Security Letter request in Atlas . Once the request is approved, students can pick up the letter by bringing their employer letter to the Office of International Affairs. F-1 Students on Curricular Practical Training (CPT) Students working with CPT work authorization should submit the documents listed above with their CPT authorized I-20 (on page 3) and job offer for their CPT employment. No letter from OIA is necessary. F-1 Students with an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) Under certain circumstances, F-1 students can obtain an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) that permits them to work off campus. In most cases, F-1 students with an EAD are on Optional Practical Training. F-1 students who have an EAD need to submit the standard documents listed above and should show their EAD when they apply. Letters from the employer and OIA are not necessary. J-1 Students Not Sponsored by IUPUI J-1 students with a sponsor other than “Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis” in Item 2 of their DS-2019 must get a letter from their official sponsor. Many of these sponsors, such as IIE-Fulbright, provide these letters at their orientation. J-1 students must submit this letter in addition to the standard documents listed above. J-1 Scholars J scholars must show their original DS-2019 form in addition to the standard documents above. They do not need to submit additional materials. Letters from the employer and OIA are not necessary. H1-B Employees H1-B employees should take their passport, I-94 entry record and I-797 Approval Notice to apply for an SSN. Dependents F-2 Dependents F-2 dependents may not work and therefore do not qualify for a Social Security number. The Social Security Administration office will not accept their application. J-2 Dependents If you are in J-2 status, you can obtain an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) from the USCIS. Talk to OIA about how to do this. Once you have the EAD, you can take it, along with your passport, I-94 entry record, DS-2019, and another piece of identification to the Social Security Administration to apply. H4 Dependents H4 dependents may not work and therefore do not qualify for a Social Security number. The Social Security Administration office will not accept their application. Timing Issues Entry-based Issues Students Data from your I-94 card or approval notice is input into a federal database called SAVE, and downloaded periodically for other agencies to view. The process is often slow, especially during peak travel times. OIA strongly recommends that you wait a minimum of three weeks after entry into the United States (or Change of Status) before applying for a Social Security number. Also, new students need to wait until their SEVIS record is activated before visiting the SSA. New student records are activated in the first week of classes as long as the student is enrolled in classes. If you need to apply for your SSN urgently before classes begin, please email iadvisor@iupui.edu to request early activation. Scholars If you are a J-1 scholar, you may visit the Social Security Administration once your SEVIS record has been validated. We will validate your J-1 record after you attend scholar orientation at OIA. Job-Based Issues If you are applying for a SSN based on a job offer, you cannot apply more than 30 days before your employment start date. Processing Time Once you have met all the criteria listed here, your application will usually take about two weeks to process. Your social security card will be sent to you by regular mail. If at any time you become a permanent resident of the United States, you should return to the Social Security Administration and get your social security card updated so that it contains no USCIS restrictions on employment.

But you do need to submit Form 8843 for yourself and your dependents. If you need to file a tax return, Sprintax will help you prepare it for FREE. You also can prepare your state tax return (if necessary) for a small fee. To get started: 1. Gather all of your 2022 tax documents (W-2, 1042-S, 1099, and/or any other forms).

Tax Documents You will need your passport, your nonimmigrant visa (stamped in passport), and any IRS form W-2 or 1042-S forms you received from IUPUI or other employer during 2021 to properly complete the tax filing. You should also have any form 1099 that you received and check routing information — your checkbook or an unused check. You should have received a W-2 form if tax was withheld from your wages. If you had income and tax was not withheld — for instance, if you were eligible for a tax treaty benefit or had a scholarship or fellowship, you should have received a form 1042-S. It is possible to have received both a W-2 and a 1042-S. 1042-S forms were mailed out in early February.

Tax Documents You will need your passport, your nonimmigrant visa (stamped in passport), and any IRS form W-2 or 1042-S forms you received from IUPUI or other employer during 2017 to properly complete the Thomson Reuters Foreign National Tax Resource program. You should also have any form 1099 that you received and check routing information — your checkbook or an unused check. You should have received a W-2 form if tax was withheld from your wages. If you had income and tax was not withheld — for instance, if you were eligible for a tax treaty benefit or had a scholarship or fellowship, you should have received a form 1042-S. It is possible to have received both a W-2 and a 1042-S. 1042-S forms were mailed out in early February.
