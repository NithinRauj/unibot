    "body": "  ## Roaring strong together  The Jaguar Coping and Resilience Team—what we call JagsCARE—provides immediate and short-term support and interventions for those involved in a potentially traumatic event or critical incident.  The goals of the support and interventions are to:  To request support from the JagsCARE team, contact Counseling and Psychological Services.   ### Contact CAPS  Monday–Friday, 9 a.m.–4 p.m. 317-274-2548 capsindy@iupui.edu Lockefield Village, second floor 980 Indiana Ave.  CAPS’ email is not monitored after business hours. Please do not use in emergencies.     ### Become a member of the JagsCARE team  You do NOT need to have any prior training or experience in providing mental health support services. JagsCARE interventions will sometimes take place outside of normal business hours, to help ensure that impacted people are able to attend. The actual time commitment varies by semester, depending on the number of incidents that occur.  Counseling and Psychological Services will offer JagsCARE training during the academic year. If you are interested in participating—or have questions before deciding—please reach out to:   #### Learn more about JagsCARE   ##### Who is a part of JagsCARE?  JagsCARE team members are IUPUI faculty and staff members. They receive regular training and support from our Counseling and Psychological Services team.   ##### Who is eligible to receive help from JagsCARE?  Anyone in our campus community can request and receive support from the JagsCARE team, including students, faculty, staff, emergency workers, and/or family members of those affected by the critical incident.   ##### How can the interventions help?  JagsCARE interventions and support aim to help individuals:   ### After a crisis: What to expect and what to do   #### You are not alone.  You have experienced an unusually stressful and traumatic event. In such situations, our typical coping mechanisms may be overwhelmed. Those things you usually do to manage daily stressors may simply not work. You may experience symptoms of distress and impaired functioning that you have never experienced before.   #### After a traumatic event  A critical incident occurs when an individual experiences or witnesses a threat to or loss of life, emotional safety, or way of living. Critical incidents have a profound impact on how we view the world. Thoughts, emotions, and actions surrounding the event are often difficult to recall and a sense of confusion may result. You may feel:  Some people may also have difficulty sleeping, a decreased appetite, and other physical symptoms. You may struggle to focus, concentrate, and complete tasks.  Regarding the event, you may experience:   #### Grief and loss  Traumatic events are often accompanied by death or loss of community, relationships, or sense of safety. Everyone feels grief in their own way, and there is no \"right way\" to grieve. Individual grief reactions may also differ depending on the nature of the loss (e.g., expected vs. unexpected, traumatic vs. \"natural\"). Grief can be described by five stages:  Not everyone experiences all these stages. Most people don't experience them in a specific order, rather go back and forth between stages. People who are grieving may shift between crying spells, anger, questioning, and numbness within a day or within a few minutes.   ## Facing and moving forward  It is important to pay attention to what you need as you emerge from such a significant experience.  Take a break. Your body and mind need time away from the event to heal. Limit the amount of time that you watch details about the tragedy on TV.  Avoid excessive substance use. Drugs or alcohol may dull the pain in the moment, but they ultimately make post-trauma symptoms worse. Caffeine is an initial stimulant that may contribute to anxiety and set you up for a bigger let down.  Eat and rest. Even though you may not feel like it, you need rest and energy to face the days ahead. Avoid excessive sweets and drink plenty of water.  Connect with people. Talking to people and being around others helps you to reconnect to the world. Seek out persons who care for and support you. Share your reactions, thoughts and how the experience impacted you, or talk about other things—just find ways to connect.  Exercise. To help your body expend some of the nervous energy. Don't overdo it. You may be more tired than you realize.  Establish a routine. Research indicates keeping focused on day-to-day tasks or routines helps mitigate the effects of stress. Structure will help you maintain focus and a sense of purpose and provide a needed mental break from the event.  Give yourself permission to think and feel. Acknowledging and expressing your own unique thoughts and feelings are essential elements of coping and healing. If you aren't comfortable talking with others, consider using art, such as drawings or poetry, or writing a journal.  Practice and implement relaxation techniques. This will reduce the physical symptoms of anxiety. Examples include deep breathing, muscle relaxations, visualization, and meditation.  Engage in helping others. Consider sending donations, cards, or other types of support to relief efforts or those most directly impacted by the event. Helping others often is the healthiest way to manage our own feelings of powerlessness.  Reach out. Talk to a peer support person, mental health professional, or religious/spiritual leader. Other aids may include meditation, reading, spiritual reflection, or involvement in support groups.  Find your new normal. Begin to engage in daily activities. You won't forget what you experienced—it’s now a part of your life. It’s important to recall what your life was like before the event and determine where you want to be in the future. All of this together will help you to find your new normal.   ### Need more information or support?

    "body": "  ## Benchmarking  Through benchmarking, we are able to compare key metrics collected through various assessment modes to the same key metrics tracked at our peer institutions. Benchmarking helps us to improve the quality of our services, aid us in decision-making, develop strategic plans, formulate policies, and justify services within the Division of Student Affairs.  Our staff partners with the following organizations to collect information on students’ experiences ranging from college health, substance use, student engagement, and college union experiences.   ### National College Health Assessment  The American College Health Association-National College Health Assessment (ACHA-NCHA) is a nationally recognized research survey that can assist you in collecting precise data about your students’ health habits, behaviors, and perceptions. Results are used to determine areas of need, with a focus on student health, safety, and support.  [American College Health Association-National College Health Assessment (ACHA-NCHA)](https://www.acha.org/NCHA/Home/NCHA/NCHA_Home.aspx?hkey=f8184410-19fa-4ba6-b791-43a79cef2de0)  [Results](https://irds.iupui.edu/students/student-surveys/national-college-health-assessment.html)   ### Indiana College Substance Use Survey  The Indiana College Substance Use Survey has been serving Indiana institutions of higher education since 2009. Funded by the Indiana Division of Mental Health and Addiction, the survey collects data on the prevalence of substance use and other risk behaviors among Indiana college students. Results are used to determine program effectiveness in alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs prevention, and reported in the Biennial Review Report for federal compliance (EDGAR Part 86).  [Indiana College Substance Use Survey](http://www.indianacollegiateactionnetwork.com/annual-survey.html)  [Results](https://irds.iupui.edu/students/student-surveys/indiana-college-substance-use-survey.html)   ### National Survey on Student Engagement  The National Survey on Student Engagement (NSSE) is a large survey designed to collect nationally representative data about the extent to which students are participating in educationally purposeful activities, both inside and outside the classroom. IUPUI participates in the NSSE every three years along with every campus in the Indiana University system.  [The National Survey on Student Engagement (NSSE)](https://irds.iupui.edu/students/student-surveys/nsse/index.html)   ### Association of College Unions International (ACUI)/Benchworks College Union Assessment.  Student unions occupy a unique position on college campuses -- we call ours the IUPUI Campus Center. They are often designed to be a central hub for campus activities, services, and student life in general. While they aim to maintain a campus-wide sense of community, they must also meet the needs of a diverse array of students. As students change, college unions must strive to keep pace with evolving tastes and needs. As such, data highlighting not only how and why students are using college unions, but also the perceptions of their experience are vital to improving college unions. The Association of College Unions International (ACUI)/Benchworks College Union/Student Center Assessment collects feedback from more than 16,000 students from 35 colleges and universities in the United States. This research explores the college union experience, including information about who uses college union facilities and for what, satisfaction with various aspects of college unions, and concepts that relate to overall measures of college union effectiveness.  Campus Center and Student Experiences implements the ACUI/Benchworks assessment every other year. Benchworks assessments provide insight into satisfaction across the student experience from orientation to graduation.  [ACUI/Benchworks](http://www.skyfactor.com/research-article/college-union-experience/)   ### Association of College and University Housing Officers – International (ACUHO-I)  ACUHO-I strives to be an advocate for the campus housing profession and the individuals who work in it. Through several avenues, the association informs members of the issues that they need to understand and respond to.   ### National Parent and Family Program Survey  The purpose of the Survey of College & University Parent/Family Programs is to collect information on changes and developments in services over time. In 2003, the University of Minnesota Parent Program conducted its first survey of parent and family programs to understand and track the development of parent and family relations in higher education. Parent and family programs were a relatively new focus in higher education at the time, with most services having been introduced within the previous decade and growing interest in the topic demonstrated by numerous program sessions at the National Association of Student Personnel Administrators, American College Personnel Association, and National Orientation Directors Association conferences. The survey is now a combined effort of the Rochester Institute of Technology’s Parent and Family Programs and AHEPPP: Family Engagement in Higher Education -- the professional organization formed in 2008 for higher education professionals who work with parents.

    "body": "  # Transfer student finds opportunity at IUPUI  By: Grace Wothke  Wednesday, November 08, 2023  Transferring colleges can be one of the most difficult decisions a student makes. Not only are you switching schools, but you are moving away, leaving your friends behind and starting somewhere completely different than where you came from.  I decided to ultimately transfer to IUPUI because it was a more cost effective option in terms of what you are truly getting out of being on campus (amenities, education, etc.). I also wanted to move to an area that had opportunities for me to broaden my professional experience in a more diverse way. Being at IUPUI  has allowed me to blossom into a more mature adult, ready to take on bigger challenges.  I applied to several universities before finally choosing to transfer to IUPUI. If I am being honest, the decision wasn’t that difficult when looking over my “pros and cons” list. IUPUI, though connected to all the Indiana University campuses, stood out to me simply because of its ability to have a unique identity amidst a bustling city.  IUPUI was able to offer a location flourishing with opportunity for growth, more detailed and specific majors and minors and a chance to truly put your education into your own hands. IUPUI was also the first university to send me my acceptance letter, which guided my decision.  When looking at new universities, there were three specific qualities that I was looking for. IUPUI hit everything on my list and more.     ## Internship opportunities  Applying for internships was something I was extremely excited to do as a student on an urban campus. IUPUI is located in the heart of Indianapolis, which offers the right set of circumstances for potential internships and opportunities to grow my professional skills.  The internships are limitless both on and off campus — I even applied to one. I am now an intern for the Division of Student Affairs and have learned so much about branding, graphics and writing — which has allowed me to gain real-world experience in the content writing field.   ## Diversity  Another thing I noticed when researching IUPUI was the amount of diversity throughout the campus. Diversity was one of the biggest factors that went into making my decision, as I came from a college that had ways to celebrate diversity, but was not as diverse as I had hoped.  Diversity is so important to me because I think it’s vital in human development and maturity to truly want to learn and understand other cultures, as well as befriending the individuals within it. I believe this allows for a broader perspective and a heart that is grown towards advocacy.  IUPUI has allowed me to fully submerge myself in an environment that celebrates the diversity of its student body. One of my favorite experiences of my first semester was walking into the Campus Center during the International Festival and seeing many different individuals celebrating not only themselves, but everyone on campus.   ## Academics  Once I became a student at IUPUI, I realized how much knowledge I was gaining on a weekly basis. The professors I’ve been taught by have given me skills to prosper in my future career field and stand out amongst a group of colleagues.  I’ve made professional connections through my public relations professor, Denise Herd — a still practicing public relations professional — who brought guest speakers into our class. She also prides herself on being our biggest advocate in terms of progressing our education and career within the field and having access to the tools, knowledge and resources we need to be successful.  Not only did I transfer schools, but I also changed my major when I started at IUPUI. It was heart-wrenching to hear that only a certain number of classes were accepted as valid credits, but I truly think that taking more classes from IUPUI professors will ultimately help shape me as the professional I one day hope to be.  Choosing to be a Jag was one of the best decisions thus far, and I hope other students interested in transferring here see all that IUPUI has to offer — even if your timeline doesn't match with your peers.

[Kappa Alpha Psi](https://iupuinphc.weebly.com/kappa-alpha-psi-fraternity-inc---lambda-eta-chapter.html)  The Chi City-wide chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc. was chartered on March 14, 1925 by six captivating women. Our chapter is comprised of over-achieving women from IUPUI, the University of Indianapolis, Marian University, and Butler University. We are the oldest Delta chapter in the state of Indiana, and the history of our chapter is as captivating as our sisterhood.  [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc.](https://iupuinphc.weebly.com/delta-sigma-theta-sorority-inc---chi-city-wide-chapter.html)  The brothers of Phi Beta Sigma are the fraternity’s most valuable resource and strength. They are the primary means by which the Phi Beta Sigma objectives will be achieved. In order to accomplish the fraternity’s objectives, it is essential that systems are instituted that effectively embody “Culture For Service and Service For Humanity” and promote brotherhood, scholarship, and service.  [Phi Beta Sigma](https://iupuinphc.weebly.com/phi-beta-sigma-fraternity-inc---alpha-epsilon-alpha-chapter.html)  Zeta Phi Beta Sorority was organized at Howard University on January 16, 1920 as the result of encouragement given to our five founders (Arizona Cleaver, Pearl Neal, Myrtle Tyler, Viola Tyler, and Fannie Pettie) by Charles Taylor and Langston Taylor, members of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc. Since Zeta Phi Beta’s inception, chapters have continued to be chartered across the U.S. and the world. As a result of the continued chartering of chapters, the city-wide Omicron Pi chapter was founded in Indianapolis, Ind. on April 25, 1998 by six illustrious and determined women: Latisha Kates, Karrie Woodard, Jasmine Shoemaker, Terry Preacher Ransom, Alana Washington, and Jamie Wirewick. Omicron Pi is a part of the Greater Great Lakes region of Zeta Phi Beta. Our chapter here continues to promote the ideals of Zeta Phi Beta through cultural, educational, and civic programs within the community.  [Zeta Phi Beta Sorority](https://iupuinphc.weebly.com/zeta-phi-beta-sorority-inc---omicron-pi-chapter.html)  The GlamaRHOus Gamma Zeta Chapter was chartered on April 6, 1963 by four women who brought Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority, Inc. to undergraduates in the greater Indianapolis area. The Gamma Zeta Chapter is a city-wide chapter that includes students from IUPUI, University of Indianapolis, Marian University, and Martin University. This chapter has continually upheld the image of Sigma Gamma Rho through raising awareness, strengthening our communities through service, and hosting national programs to achieve Greater Service, Greater Progress in the greater Indianapolis community in the areas of education, health awareness, and leadership development.  [Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority, Inc.](https://iupuinphc.weebly.com/sigma-gamma-rho-sorority-inc---gamma-zeta-chapter.html)  \"I joined Sigma Alpha Epsilon because I wanted more from my college experience than just my education. By joining SAE, I was able to develop and grow my social skills through interacting in the Greek-letter community, as well as my professional skills through the positions I took in my chapter.\"  -Collin Henn (SAE)  \"My favorite chapter memory was establishing Alpha Upsilon at IUPUI as the founding line. We got so much support from the Hermanas and created an amazing memory by presenting at our probate on campus as the Alpha Line.\"  -Yoriana Gallegos (SLU)    \"My favorite chapter memory is first joining ZTA and how much love I instantly felt from all of the women!\"  -Ashley Elkin (ZTA)    \"When I leave IUPUI, a lesson I will carry with me is that every struggle was put in my life to teach me a valuable lesson.\"  -Khrisma McMurray (SGRho) "

    "body": "  ## Your health is priceless  Fees are charged for visits with a provider—that’s a doctor or nurse practitioner—as well as for lab tests and diagnostic imaging, such as X-rays. Campus Health, or the company performing your lab tests and diagnostic imaging, can bill your insurance if you're in network. That means you’ll need to bring your insurance card to your appointment. If you'd like to know what services are covered, you must call your insurance company prior to your appointment.  We are in network for the following insurance plans:  When using your insurance, you are responsible for your co-pay and any remaining balance after your insurer has paid the claim.  If your insurance is out of network or if you are not insured, you will be responsible for the total cost of your visit. These charges are due at the time of your visit, or they can be billed to your bursar account. Campus Health accepts credit cards, checks, and CrimsonCard as payment.   ### Insurance and payment questions?  If you have questions about using your insurance with Campus Health, give us a call at 317-278-1640 or email us at healthfi@iu.edu .  If you are struggling paying for medical care, you can reach out to the Office of Student Advocacy and Support to learn more about your resources and options.

    "body": "  ## How early before my event can I submit my reservation request?   ## What are the maximum capacities of each space?  If you are interested in knowing more about max capacities of our meeting room spaces, please contact an Event Services Assistant at 317-278-8511 or email us at campcntr@iupui.edu .   ## How long will it take for my event request to be approved?  All requests will be reviewed within three business days from the date they are received.   ## What is fronting?  University departments and registered student organizations shall not use their privileges to access space, resources, or services and “front” for a non-university group or commercial entity in order to avoid fees or receive reduced fees. All instances of “fronting” will result in an adjustment of all related fees to the appropriate rate. The reserving group responsible for “fronting” may be subject to loss of reservation privileges.  Additionally, if a university department assumes responsibility for an event typically organized by a student organization, that student organization must be registered and in good standing with the CUBE Student Organization Center and Campus Center Event Services. Responsibility may NOT be changed to the student organization after securing space to avoid reservation and facility charges. Likewise, a university department assuming full planning responsibility for an event should not use a registered student organization to secure space in an effort to avoid reservation and facility charges.   ## What should I expect when I show up to the Campus Center at the start of my event?  Start by checking in with the Information Desk, and they will radio the Campus Center Building Manager to inform them of your arrival. They will ensure that your room is unlocked and wait for you to discuss any technology needs.   ## What is parking like for big events?  An IUPUI parking permit is required for all IUPUI parking lots and garages, with the exception of Vermont Garage, which is available to visitors for an hourly rate and metered spots along University Blvd. Please refer to the permit map and/or visitor map for details. Arrangements for parking can be made for events and meetings by contacting IUPUI Parking and Transportation Services at 317-274-4232 or permits@iupui.edu . For student organizations, IUPUI Parking and Transportation Services is a partner with the Event Activity Registration Process and details can be arranged on The Spot.  [permit map](https://parking.iupui.edu/doc/maps/permit_map_main.pdf)  [visitor map](https://parking.iupui.edu/parking/visitors/index.html)   ## What are the different types of setups I can choose from?  The Campus Center offers many different setups to accommodate any event type or idea that you may have. Please review the list of setups that we offer below:  If you are interested in seeing examples of how these setups look in our meeting rooms, please contact an Event Services Assistant and they will send you diagrams of each setup option.  The Event Services team will also work with you if one of our predetermined setups do not meet your event need. We are able to make a diagram for your specific event and send it to you for your approval.   ## When will I know my event is confirmed?  The Campus Center Event Services Assistants will reach out to you after you have submitted the request for your event.  For student organizations, the first confirmation you will receive is a TENTATIVE confirmation. This means that our team has found space during the time you requested, and the rest of your event falls within our predetermined guidelines. Once the event is approved on The Spot by The CUBE team, the Event Services Assistants will send you an official confirmation. This will include the name, date, time, and other critical information of your event. We will also include your reservation number and resources that will be provided to you.  Departments will receive a confirmation email once it is decided by an Event Services Assistant that the event is in an appropriate time and room. If we find that your requested time does not fit in with our event schedule, we will reach out to you and discuss adjusting the time and/or location of the event to accommodate your needs. Departments will receive confirmation from the Campus Center once that is coordinated.  It is not uncommon for the Event Services Assistants to email the organization or department with questions before we send the official confirmation. Please be on the lookout for emails from our team once you have submitted an event so we can process your request in a timely manner.   ## What if I am planning on having food at my event?  For all food service needs, Chartwells (IUPUI Food Services) is the contracted, exclusive food service provider, which includes all retail, catering, and concession sales on the IUPUI campus. For exceptions, please contact Chartwells directly.   ## How can I check for availability for rooms?  The Campus Center Event Services team is more than happy to check availability for all departments, student organizations, and external guests. Our desk is open Monday-Friday, 8 a.m.-5 p.m. You can call us at 317-278-8511 or email us at campcntr@iupui.edu .   ## What are the internet and phone connections like?  All spaces within the Campus Center are Wi-Fi enabled, and any member of the IU system can access the internet by connecting with their staff, faculty, or student credentials through IU Secure.  Guests in the Campus Center can access no-fee Wi-Fi through the “IU Guest” network. Guests will need to accept the terms of use listed on the log in page and then click “Register.”  Depending on the service carrier, there are areas of the Campus Center facility where cellular signals are weak. The only public telephone in the facility is located on the Lower Level and can only be used to make local, Indianapolis calls.   ## Is there a lost and found at the Campus Center?  Campus Center Event Services is not responsible for any lost, stolen, or damaged property belonging to guests of the facility. Every effort will be made to return lost/misplaced items whenever possible. The Campus Center Lost and Found is located at the Information Desk on Level 1. Items deemed to be of high value (credit/debit cards, driver’s licenses, cell phones, etc.) will be turned over to Indiana University Police Department (IUPD) at the end of each business day. Other items will be held until the end of the month in which they were turned in before being discarded and/or donated. It is the responsibility of the reserving group to ensure all items are removed from the space following a reservation. Any items left by a reserving entity will be kept a maximum of seven business days, after which time they will be discarded or donated.   ## Is security provided by the Campus Center for large events that need it?  IUPD is responsible for public safety while event and meeting guests are on university property. Additional security may be required for certain events, a determination that will be made by IUPD. If an activity is determined to need IUPD and/or ESG presence, the event hosts will be responsible for all associated costs. Additionally, once it is determined that the presence of IUPD is necessary for an event, IUPD then reserves the right to cancel or postpone an event if they are unable to provide the staff necessary or do not approve the nature of the event.  In general, if IUPD presence is required, for every 50 attendees present at an event, there must be one officer.   ## How do I reserve an information table?  Limited space is available for information tables inside the Campus Center for both internal and external entities to promote themselves, their activities, and/or their products. An information table will consist of one table and two chairs. The table will be covered with an IUPUI tablecloth unless otherwise requested. Organizations are prohibited from supplying their own tables and/or booths. Only one table may be reserved per organization per day, not to exceed three days in a given week. Additional tables may be requested but require special permission from the Campus Center Event Services team. Please be prepared to provide, in writing, rationale for requesting multiple information tables. Information tables can only be reserved as long as they are not offering products or services already found in the Campus Center or provided by IUPUI.   ## Can I bring decorations to my event?  To prevent as much associated damage as possible, the Campus Center Event Services staff has restricted the types of decorations that may be used within the facility. If found in violation of any of these restrictions, meeting and event organizers may be assessed a $150 cleaning/damage fee payable at the time of invoice. Please see the Campus Center Event Policy Manual included in your reservation  confirmation for a list of what is not accepted in the Campus Center.   ### Start planning your event today "

    "body": "  ## When life gives you a challenge, we give you support  Life doesn’t always work out the way you want it to. Emergencies—academic and personal—happen, and when they do, you need to know someone’s got your back. That’s why we’re here.  When you need a caring, knowledgeable, and supportive champion, we are in your corner.  When you’re having an academic problem, we can help you navigate university policies and find the appropriate support services. We’ve included some information below, and if you need additional support, make an appointment with us.   ### Contact us  317-274-4431 Campus Center 350 To have an advocate reach out to you, visit go.iupui.edu/refer2osas.  [go.iupui.edu/refer2osas.](https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?IndianaUniv&layout_id=204)  To contact the confidential advocate for situations of sexual violence, dating or relationship violence, stalking, or more, please email saadv@iupui.edu or call 317-274-2548.   ### University policies and procedures   #### Absence policy  There is no single university policy on absences. Communicate directly with your professors if you are unable to attend classes. Depending on the policies for a particular course or department, they may request documentation such as a doctor’s note.  We do not provide oversight for academic units or faculty. However, in an emergency situation such as hospitalization, we can contact your instructors if you will miss class for three or more days or are unable to inform them directly. We recommend talking with your instructors as soon as possible to discuss accommodations and make-up procedures for your courses. A withdrawal from classes may be necessary for extended absences.   #### Dropping classes  There are several deadlines each term for dropping classes. If you can no longer drop a class on your own through One.IU —this deadline is usually the first week of the term—you must meet with your academic advisor. More information about dropping classes can be found through the Office of the Registrar .  [One.IU](https://one.iu.edu/)  [Registrar](https://studentcentral.iupui.edu/register/index.html)   #### Grade changes and grievances  Before submitting a grade change petition, we recommend speaking with your instructor calmly, directly, and in person. If you believe your course grade is incorrect, you can follow the university’s formal grade grievances procedure. As with all university polies, we are available to help you understand these procedures and navigate the process.  [grade change](https://studentcentral.iupui.edu/grades-progress/grade-changes/index.html)  If you have other concerns about a professor’s conduct or are unable to reach a resolution on other disputes, you may address your concerns to the course coordinator or department chair. You can also request an appointment with us for conflict coaching to discuss your concerns and ways to approach the conversation with your instructor.   #### Withdrawing from classes  When an emergency prevents you from being able to attend courses, you may need to withdraw from classes. Being hospitalized, a death in your immediate family, or being the victim of a crime are just a few examples of what might constitute an emergency. If you aren’t sure if your situation warrants an emergency withdrawal, we can help you figure it out.  You may need documentation to withdraw from a class. Your documentation should provide your contact information, including name, address, and phone and fax numbers, as well as answer the questions below. It should also be signed and dated. We can help you submit this documentation.   ### Emergency financial support  Our student advocacy team can help connect you to on-campus and community resources when you’re in a financial pinch.

We’ve listed a variety of resources below that might be able to help. You can ask your Quit Coach for more information.   ## Nicotine Replacement Therapies (NRT)  NRT is a type of treatment that gives small, steady doses of nicotine to help stop cravings and relieve symptoms that occur when a person is trying to quit using nicotine. These products include nicotine gum, nicotine inhaler, nicotine nasal spray, nicotine lozenges, and nicotine patch, and most are available without a prescription at your local pharmacy.   ## Prescriptions  There are prescription medications that have been shown to help nicotine-users quit, and some can be used along with NRTs to increase success of quitting. Consult with a physician about which prescription and NRT combination would work best for you. We recommend visiting Campus Health on IUPUI's campus.   ## Coaching/counseling  Seeking out individual, group, or phone coaching/counseling has been proven to be effective for helping people quit. Your IUPUI Quit Coach can offer free, non-clinical coaching services. If you’re looking for mental health counseling, consider reaching out to Counseling and Psychological Services at IUPUI .   ## Supporting others quitting  Having the right support is integral to being successful and staying nicotine-free.

    "body": "  ## Green Dot bystander intervention: Reducing and ending power-based personal violence  Green Dot is a program that empowers all of us to step into the vital role of being a good bystander. Knowing how and when to speak up helps prevent power-based interpersonal violence from occurring on our campus. The Green Dot program is for all students, faculty, and staff at IUPUI, and it is facilitated through training sessions. You’ll build skills for intervening in situations in a way that fits your individual comfort level and skills.  While one person may not be able to change the entire culture of our campus, each of our individual actions will lead to a culture that does not stand for sexual assault, dating violence, or stalking.   ### Why Green Dot?  Green Dot has been used in training 50+ colleges and universities across the U.S., as well as in high schools, the Air Force, and community programs.  In a study of high schools across Kentucky, Green Dot was estimated to have prevented approximately 120 instances of sexual violence in the third year of implementation and 88 instances of sexual violence in the fourth year of implementation. Sexual assault perpetration rates were 21% lower in intervention schools, and sexual assault victimization rates were 13% lower. Similar patterns were observed for dating violence, stalking, and sexual harassment perpetration and victimization.  Green Dot’s focus on individual actions as bystanders empowers participants toward culture change.   ### How to request a Green Dot training  Our team would love to train you on the Green Dot bystander intervention program. Currently, we’re focusing on training faculty and staff, and we will open up trainings to students soon. To request a Green Dot training for your faculty or staff group, please fill out our online form .   ## Definitions and more information  Bystander, Green Dot, intervention—these all might be new concepts for you. We recognize that can be overwhelming, so we’ve compiled some information to introduce you to the Green Dot program.     ## What is a green dot?  A green dot is a single moment in time when someone makes a choice to intervene and prevent a red dot from happening or getting worse. Imagine a green dot appearing on our campus.  As we add more green dots to our campus, we will begin to outnumber and displace the red dots, causing incidents of power-based violence (sexual assaults, dating/domestic violence, and stalking) to decrease.  It is important for us all to develop realistic solutions to intervene, even when it is difficult.   ## What is a red dot?  Imagine that every time an act of power-based personal violence occurs, a red dot appears on our campus. Red dots include incidents of sexual assault, dating/domestic violence, and stalking. Here are some examples of when a red dot might appear:  Over time, these red dots add up and too many people in our community are harmed. This creates a culture that allows unacceptable rates of sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking to occur.  We have a key role in preventing red dots from happening in our community. As bystanders, we play two major roles in addressing power-based violence:   ## Who is a bystander?   ## What are the warning signs of red dots?  As a bystander, you may know the person doing the harm, the person being harmed, or even both. Remember, people of all genders are at risk for power-based personal violence.  As bystanders, the warning signs we notice can be different, and what we notice can change depending on our relationships with the people involved. Below are common warning signs you may notice as a bystander.  For sexual assault:  For dating/domestic violence:  For stalking:   ## What are barriers a bystander could encounter?  Even when we notice warning signs and have the impulse to intervene, sometimes it can be difficult to do something due to our own barriers. We all have barriers that prevent us from intervening sometimes.   ## How many types of green dots are there?   ## What are reactive green dots?  Reactive green dots are what you can do when you see something concerning happening. It can be a reaction to something in progress to either stop the action or prevent more harm from happening. There are three reactive green dot options. You should utilize the one that is most realistic for you.   ## What are proactive green dots?  Proactive green dots are things you can do to stop red dots before they occur. They help set positive norms. To create these norms, we must DO and SAY things to let those around us know our values. Norms are set by small decisions.  Proactive green dots reset our campus norms and make it clear that:  Consider this question: How do I communicate to my friends, co-workers, and peers that power-based personal violence prevention efforts are important to me?  Examples of proactive green dots: "

Some of these needs include food, housing, finances, good health, recreation facilities, and mentorship services throughout the education cycle. We collect data on students through surveys and focus groups.   ### Indiana College Substance Use Survey  The Indiana College Substance Use Survey has been serving Indiana institutions of higher education since 2009. Funded by the Indiana Division of Mental Health and Addiction, the survey collects data on the prevalence of substance use and other risk behaviors among Indiana college students. Results are used to determine program effectiveness in alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs prevention, and reported in the Biennial Review Report for federal compliance (EDGAR Part 86).

IUPUI participates in the NSSE every three years along with every campus in the Indiana University system.  [The National Survey on Student Engagement (NSSE)](https://irds.iupui.edu/students/student-surveys/nsse/index.html)   ### Entering Student Survey  The IUPUI Entering Student Survey is administered to incoming first-year and transfer students during their summer orientation.

[Mentor Intake Survey](https://irds.iupui.edu/students/student-surveys/mentor-intake-survey.html)   ### End-of-First Semester Survey  The End-of-First Semester Survey is designed to assess first-time, first-year students’ perceptions, self-reported learning, experiences, and reasons for choosing not to reenroll at IUPUI. The survey examines many different aspects of students’ life and academic experiences and provides insights into their first semester of college at IUPUI.  [End-of-First Semester Survey](https://irds.iupui.edu/students/student-surveys/end-of-first-semester-survey.html)   ### National College Health Assessment  The American College Health Association-National College Health Assessment (ACHA-NCHA) is a nationally recognized research survey that can assist you in collecting precise data about your students’ health habits, behaviors, and perceptions. Results are used to determine areas of need, with a focus on student health, safety, and support.

The JagsSPEAK surveys are conducted in conjunction with the Division of Student Affairs and various units across campus with a focus on specific actionable decisions. Sometimes, we coordinate JagsSPEAK town halls where students can hear how the information is being used.  [JagsSPEAK Surveys](https://irds.iupui.edu/students/student-surveys/jagsspeak.html)   ### MyStudentBody  MyStudentBody offers a comprehensive approach to reducing the risk of drug and alcohol abuse and sexual violence among college students. MyStudentBody is available at any time all semester long, and it provides information on drugs, alcohol, sexual violence, and other health and wellness issues that can affect academic success. MyStudentBody Essentials is an online prevention education course intended for incoming students. It covers the three most significant behavioral risks new college students face: alcohol, illicit and prescription drugs, and sexual violence. Structured around a motivational self-assessment in each area, Essentials incorporates audio, video, and interactive tools and lessons to teach students key concepts and skills.   ## Student satisfaction  Through precise, specific, and detailed surveys, we are able to understand the satisfaction of our students at IUPUI as we offer programs, services, and updated facilities.

Along this journey, students will have many opportunities to reflect upon their classroom and cocurricular learning, develop their expertise in their chosen field, and grow as a human being. Students will become acquainted with each of the Profiles —communicator, problem solver, innovator, and community contributor—beginning in general education courses and first-year experiences and continuing as students progress along their pathway through their major coursework and cocurricular activities toward their capstone or culminating experience.  [Profiles](https://profiles.iupui.edu/)   ### Assessment of student learning outcomes  Student learning outcomes can be measured directly or indirectly. Direct measurements can be through classroom assignments, presentations, portfolios, e-portfolios, tests, and essays. Indirect measurements can be through self-assessments, questionnaires, peer feedback, and end-of-course evaluations. "

However, there are different reservations processes and costs for different groups.   ## IUPUI registered student organizations  Student organizations can reserve Campus Center spaces for free, so long as they are properly registered with the CUBE Student Organization Center. Once registered, all space requests must be submitted through The Spot for full consideration. The only officer position permitted to submit events for student organizations is the designated reservationist.  [The Spot](https://thespot.iupui.edu/)  Please be advised that due to the comprehensive nature of the process, it is possible to receive multiple approvals for specific aspects of an event and, ultimately, have the request denied. Members of student organizations are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the event and activity registration process through the resources provided by the CUBE Student Organization Center team . Student interest groups who are in the process of forming a student organization will be able to reserve space for three low-risk organizational meetings within a 60-day period before full registration will be required to request space.   ## IUPUI departments and schools  Departments and schools are defined as university departments and/or offices meeting to conduct business directly related to their function, operations, or mission of the university. IUPUI departments and schools can reserve space 13 months in advance.

Requests may also be made by phone, email, or walk-in. Please be advised that all requests submitted online are simply requests—not confirmed reservations—and can be denied by the Campus Center Event Services team. Meeting and event organizers should wait until a reservation confirmation has been received via email before continuing any planning and marketing of the event.   ## Non-university organizations  Campus Center space may be reserved by groups or organizations unaffiliated with IUPUI so long as their purpose/mission does not contradict the mission/purpose of IUPUI. Decisions related to any possible contradiction is at the discretion of the Campus Center. Space may not be used for non-university fundraising or political initiatives. Non-university organizations can submit requests by contacting the Campus Center Event Services team at 317-278-8511 or campcntr@iupui.edu .   ### Special event reservations  We have established procedures to ensure we provide appropriate support and planning for your special events.

You can be a key contributor to our democracy with three simple actions: register, learn, and advocate.  Because the world around us changes daily, our programs change to keep up with the issues and topics that matter most to you.  Our Civic Engagement Assistants are IUPUI students who work throughout the year to help make engaging in democracy easy. You can contact them at 317-278-3699 or ccsecea@iupui.edu , and they are located in Campus Center 350.  “I love my job because I have the opportunity to encourage young voters just like me to vote and engage in their community.”   ### Take part in democracy by learning about your voting rights  Our voter rights and registration programs allow you to get registered to vote, learn about your rights as a voter, and learn more about how to engage in our democracy. A list of common events and programs for IUPUI students are below.   ## National Voter Registration Day  National Voter Registration Day is a nonpartisan, civic holiday celebrating our democracy. On the third Tuesday in September, we focus our in-person, virtual, and media efforts on providing you information on how to register to vote. You can visit the official online voter guide to learn how to make your voice count.  [official online voter guide](https://comenga2.sitehost.iu.edu/service-opportunities/voting-guide.html)   ## Day of Democracy  Day of Democracy is where you learn about all the ways to be civically engaged in the community. We bring in our local Marion County Board of Elections to test out the voter machines and get you familiar with the city of Indianapolis. Past special guests have included the League of Women Voters, Indiana Disability Rights, Women4Change, and more.   ## Vote Early Day  Vote Early Day will help all eligible voters learn about their voting options and celebrate the act of voting early. When Americans vote early, they ensure that last minute issues will not prevent them from casting their ballots. Saturday, October 23, 2021 is Vote Early Day .  [Vote Early Day](https://www.voteearlyday.org/)   ## National Voter Education Week  National Voter Education Week will help all voters understand all the tools and information available to be confident in casting their ballots. This week of activities is held during the first week of October.  [week of activities](https://votereducationweek.org/)   ## March to the Polls  March to the Polls is hosted during the last week of October as an opportunity to mobilize your fellow Jaguars, hear from local organizers, and conduct your civic duty with a quick trip to our nearest polling place to vote.   ## Election Day  Election Day is our time to shine! Whether you are needing directions to the nearest polling place or having an issue of what’s on the ballot, we are here to help. We will be on campus and virtually to serve you to make sure it's a smooth day at the polls.   ### Make the issues come alive  Understanding civil discourse, both what it is and how to practice it, is key to our political process, being responsible citizens, and creating change. Our Civic Engagement Assistants are available to teach your student organization, class, or team about civil discourse and the importance of voting.  Request a presentation   #### Engaging in politics  Government Relations at IU can assist you and your organization in engaging in the political process .

    "body": "  ## When a picture is worth 1,000 words, let the MPC do the talking  It can be tough getting noticed with so many events and programs on campus. The Multimedia Production Center (MPC) can help you stand out with printing and design services that make your print and electronic advertising easy and effective.   ### RSO pricing has never looked better  Printing is available at no charge for Registered Student Organizations. You’ll get 300 free prints each semester to promote your programs and events. Need your poster super-sized for research, presentations, or events? We can do that, too, at a reduced cost. You can also trade in some of your free prints to cover large-format printing for your organization’s promotions and events. (Sorry, research posters don’t qualify for discounts.)   ### Employee pricing—a benefit to everyone  Printing is also available to IUPUI faculty and staff at prices that are generally cheaper than off-campus options. The money from these sales goes back to student organizations and allows us to provide promotional services to them at little to no cost. Not only do you save money, but you also support our student organizations and student employment.   ### Open for business  Hours: Monday–Friday, 9 a.m.–4 p.m.   ### Contact us   ### Think outside the box  The MPC does more than just print awesome promotions on paper. It also offers digital and email account services.  The MPC will also help RSOs create a website account. We make getting a new sitehost, MySQL database, or digital media streaming service easy.  If you’re a new RSO, we can create an official @iupui.edu email account so you can get down to business. If you already have an account but cannot remember your passphrase, we can help with that, too.   ### Let your creative juices flow and design with the MPC  [See sample work](https://www.facebook.com/mpc.iupui/) "

    "body": "  ## Stay the course  You’ve made amazing changes in your life, and you’re on the road to recovery. Maybe what you're looking for now is a group of peers who understand what it’s like to travel that road while in college. The Collegiate Recovery Community (CRC) at IUPUI is your chance to connect with fellow Jags and be supported while you maintain your recovery.  The overall goal of the CRC is a simple one: provide social support and a referral network with access to community resources, regardless of whether you are recovering from substance abuse, behavioral addictions such as gambling or sex, or something else altogether.   ### Find strength in numbers  We currently provide weekly peer support groups for a variety of recovery needs. There are also general CRC meetings where you can help plan awareness events, social outings, and volunteer opportunities. Regardless of what you are recovering from, there is a support network in place to help you succeed.  If you’re looking for more individualized support, you can work with a recovery coach. This person can motivate you and help you solve problems. They are not a counselor or a sponsor, and they don’t replace a therapist or physician. However, they can be a valuable mentor on your path to recovery. When you work with a recovery coach, you will:  If you feel you would benefit from a therapist or doctor, contact Counseling and Psychological Services or visit the Help Me R.O.A.R. website for community resources. You can also find more information about recovery and recovery support from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) .  [Help Me R.O.A.R.](https://helpmeroar.iupui.edu/)  [Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)](https://www.samhsa.gov/recovery)   ### Weekly support meetings  In-person and virtual support meeting times and locations are posted on the campus events calendar.  [meeting times and locations](https://events.iu.edu/studentaffairsiupui/all/tags/CRC)   ### Recovery community contacts  To learn more about addiction recovery services at IUPUI, contact Health and Wellness Promotion at 317-274-3699 or hwpindy@iupui.edu or the Collegiate Recovery Community student organization at recovery@iupui.edu .  [Tweets by @RecoveryIUPUI](https://twitter.com/RecoveryIUPUI)  [https://www.facebook.com/recoveryiupui/](https://www.facebook.com/recoveryiupui/)   ### Recovery group FAQs  If you’re new to the recovery community, you might have a few questions. If, after checking out our FAQs, you still are unsure if the CRC is right for you, contact Health and Wellness Promotion .   #### What’s the difference between a CRC meeting and a support meeting?  CRC meetings are for the collegiate recovery community as a whole, meaning they’re open to allies, friends, recovery advocates, and volunteers as well as those in recovery. They’re great for planning awareness events and networking. Support meetings are topic-specific groups for students in recovery.   #### Who can attend support meetings?  Our peer support meetings are intended for individuals who are in recovery for specific issues. However, meetings may be considered “open.” In this case, students might try out the meeting to see if it’s right for them, and others might bring guests with them.   #### Are support meetings anonymous?  We respect anonymity. As a support group participant, you are not required to sign in or provide identifying information. However, our meetings are considered open, meaning you may encounter a friend or guest who is not in recovery themselves.   #### Are support meetings the same as AA meetings?  No. Our peer support meetings focus on sharing successes, challenges, support, and understanding. We are not affiliated with any national or 12-step programs, nor do we follow a specific curriculum. Many of our participants also attend other types of recovery meetings in addition to our on-campus support groups.  [recovery meetings](https://facesandvoicesofrecovery.org/resources/mutual-aid-resources/)   #### Can I attend a support meeting for a class assignment or to satisfy a court order?  No. However, you may contact the CRC at recovery@iupui.edu for help finding an open meeting in the community to meet your requirement.   #### Can I observe a support meeting?  Support meetings are intended for students who are in recovery. If you are curious about recovery but are not in recovery yourself, contact the CRC at recovery@iupui.edu . They can connect you with ways to volunteer or network with other students.   ### Use your voice  If you are willing to speak out about your recovery, we offer educational outreach opportunities such as awareness events, campus presentations, and panel discussions. With your help, we can challenge the stigma surrounding addiction recovery. Share your story of addiction recovery by emailing recovery@iupui.edu . You can also subscribe to our newsletter. "

The university makes all assignments without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, or veteran status and rejects all requests for changes of assignment based on such.   ### Roommate request process  If you want to live on campus with a specific person, there is a process to follow to ensure we place you in the correct rooms.  Your roommate requests must be mutual—meaning you both have to request each other. Additionally, you both must request a specific Residential Based Learning Community or not. Choosing different RBLCs, for example, could impact you being placed as roommates.  The roommate request process is open April through June of each year, with students receiving their assignments and roommate information in mid-July.   ### Contract details  From billing details to behavioral expectations, your housing contract is an important document that you should be familiar with.

Our self-assessments address concerns such as suicide and self-harm, depression, anxiety, trauma and abuse, and alcohol and other drugs. These tools are educational—not diagnostic. If you need additional support, call or email CAPS.  Start your self-screening  [Start your self-screening](https://screener.ulifeline.org/?_ga=2.11612148.1349901817.1595118543-714065962.1595118543)   ### Additional information and self-help and crisis resources   #### CAPS crisis services  If you’re experiencing suicidal thoughts, are having trouble completing daily tasks, or are facing an acute stressor that threatens the safety of yourself or others, we’ll arrange a same-day emergency appointment.  CAPS’ on-call counselors are available 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday. Call us at 317-274-2548.   #### Suicide and self-harm  Have you been thinking about ending your life or hurting yourself? Are you feeling overwhelmed? There are people who will listen. Consider reaching out to one of the 24-hour hotlines listed below. Then contact CAPS to find ways to stay safe and build the life you want to live.  If you or someone you know is in immediate danger of suicide, call 911 immediately or call the IU Police Department emergency line at 317-274-7911.   #### Depression, anxiety, and mood disorders  If you’ve been feeling sad, irritable, helpless, or get easily frustrated, you may be experiencing depression, anxiety, or another mood disorder. Any of these can interfere with your function and ability to complete day to day tasks.  Mood disorders can include:  Stress and nervousness are natural parts of life. However, worries that interfere with your ability to participate in daily life are not. In addition to extreme worry, clinical anxiety may include fear or avoidance of specific situations, intrusive thoughts, repetitive behaviors, or persistent or intrusive memories of a past trauma. You may also experience physical symptoms of distress such as a racing heart, difficulty breathing, shaking, or nausea.   #### Trauma, abuse, and assault  A traumatic event often involves a physical threat to life or safety such as a natural disaster, an accident, or a human act. But any situation that leaves you feeling overwhelmed or powerless can be considered traumatic and lead to strong emotional reactions. Common reactions include:  Every individual will have their own emotional response, and your reactions will likely change over time. Understanding that these reactions are normal following a traumatic event can help you on the road to recovery.  Some people will also experience symptoms such as anxiety, intrusive memories, flashbacks, hypervigilance, and avoidance for an extended period of time. This may be post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and can often be treated with a combination of medication and counseling. We can help you find effective ways to cope with your symptoms and find a sense of meaning in your life as a trauma survivor.  [post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)](https://www.ptsd.va.gov/)  Sexual abuse, rape, stalking and other types of sexual misconduct are forms of violence. These acts, which occur any time a person does not actively consent to a sexual interaction, are not about sex. They are about power and control. If you have been affected by a sexual assault or harassment, relationship violence, including intimidation, controlling behavior or physical violence, or other forms of trauma, find support and resources from CAPS or the assistant director of interpersonal violence prevention and response by emailing saadv@iupui.edu .  [forms of violence.](https://stopsexualviolence.iu.edu/)   #### Alcohol and other drugs  There are many misconceptions about alcohol and drug use in college. This can sometimes cause students to consume more than is healthy or in ways that don’t match their personal values. Are you concerned about your drinking or substance use? Have you found yourself wondering how much is too much?  If you need help, you can reach out to our Health and Wellness Promotion team at hwpindy@iupui.edu .  You can also take self-screening quizzes, learn the laws and policies, and learn tips to safely drinking on our alcohol and other drugs website .  [alcohol and other drugs website](https://alcohol.iupui.edu/index.html)   #### Body image and eating concerns  Food can fuel our bodies, but it can also be used to help us cope with emotional and mental distress. Eating can be a source of comfort and calming, while restricting consumption can provide a sense of control.  Many people respond to life stressors by altering their eating behavior. This may lead to medical complications if left untreated. Excessive food restriction, chronic binging and/or purging, or focused attempts to attain the “perfect body” can be signs of disordered eating.  If you or someone you care about is afraid of gaining weight or is concerned about their eating habits, complete a self-assessment, or contact CAPS.   #### Personal Wellness Inventory  This assessment will help you identify which of the eight dimensions of wellness is your strongest and which you might benefit from spending extra time developing.

Our four residence halls offer unique features and amenities, are walkable to many academic buildings, and have access to the JagLINE , our campus’ free shuttle system.  [the JagLINE](https://parking.iupui.edu/transportation/bus/bus.html)   ### Ball Hall  First-year students can find modern amenities at an economical price. In 2021, a $16.4 million renovation was completed to provide essential updates to this historic building. Approximately 325 first-year students reside in Ball Hall each year in single, double, or triple rooms.   #### Ball Hall virtual tour  Watch this video to learn more about our campus’ oldest residence hall.     #### Ball Hall 360 tour  This video takes you on a 360 tour, so you can further explore the residence hall.     #### Ball Hall history  Ball Residence Hall was originally built in 1928 and was made possible by a gift from the Ball brothers of Muncie, Ind. In the original construction, Ball Hall featured a gymnasium, library, offices, house-mother apartment, classrooms, and laboratories. Today, remnants of these original features and the classic architecture of 1928 can be seen throughout the residence hall. Ball Annex was later constructed in two phases to provide additional housing for student nurses. The first two floors were constructed in 1945 followed by the third and fourth floors in 1957. In the summer of 2013, Ball Hall received several facility upgrades including a lobby renovation, new resident furniture in every room, and every resident room was repainted. Ball Hall recently underwent a $16.7 million renovation which included adding air conditioning to the resident rooms, newly constructed bathrooms, and updates to the building's infrastructure.   ### University Tower  With private bathrooms in every room, University Tower offers first-year students beautiful views of the city skyline and quick access to three dining options. Home to 600 first-year students each year, each room is a triple and has a private bathroom.   #### University Tower virtual tour  Watch this video to learn more about all that University Tower has to offer.     #### University Tower 360 tour  This video takes you on a 360 tour, so you can further explore the residence hall.     #### University Tower history  University Tower, formerly the University Place Hotel, was once a four-diamond hotel and conferencing staple in downtown Indianapolis. With the increasing demand for on-campus student housing and classroom space—and the need to reassess the viability of continuing hotel and conference center operations—the decision to convert this facility from a hotel and conference center to first-year student housing, classroom space, and a traditional university dining facility was announced in the spring of 2012. With only 14 months of preparation, the hall welcomed its inaugural first-year class in fall 2013.   ### North Hall  Our campus’ newest residential facility, North Hall was designed with a focus on giving students plenty of common spaces—30 to be exact—to interact, study, and socialize. This hall combines traditional style living with modern convenience to about 680 students each year, offering single rooms, single rooms with private bathrooms, and double rooms.   #### North Hall virtual tour  Watch this video to learn more about all that North Hall has to offer.     #### North Hall 360 tour  This video takes you on a 360 tour, so you can further explore the residence hall.     #### North Hall history  North Hall opened in 2016 and was designed with a focus on giving students plenty of common spaces to interact, study, and socialize. It’s located next to University Tower and the Campus Recreation Outdoor Facility. North Hall provides housing for over 600 students.   ### Riverwalk Apartments  A versatile facility with options to fit your needs, Riverwalk features apartment- and townhome-style living. All of Riverwalk's living options include a full kitchen, washer and dryer in each unit, and all utilities are included in the rental costs. Select spaces are available for first-year students who need accommodations.   #### Riverwalk 360 tour (two-bedroom apartment)     #### Riverwalk 360 tour (four-bedroom apartment)     #### Riverwalk history  Originally named Campus Apartments on the River Walk, buildings opened in 2003 and 2004 as construction was completed in phases on the former site of Warthin Apartments. Each of the buildings in Riverwalk Apartments were named in honor of a past campus community leader.   ### Housing costs and amenities  We understand that cost is an important factor when deciding where you live. From extensive programs and events to exclusive housing scholarship opportunities, living on campus gives you more opportunities to connect and succeed as you pursue your degree.  Room rates for 2024-25 will be available soon, as they are determined by the Indiana University Board of Trustees. You can expect to see anywhere from a 2 to 5% increase from the 2023-24 rates listed below. Rates are per student per semester.  Ball Residence Hall—First-year only  Single or shared room with bath (Limited availability)  Double or triple rooms with bath (Randomly assigned)  Single with bath  Single or double  Riverwalk Apartments—All private bedrooms  One bedroom  Two bedroom/one bathroom  Two bedroom/two bathroom  Four bedroom   #### Amenities offered to all students  All housing rates include the following:   #### Meal plans  If you are living in Ball Hall, University Tower, and North Hall, you will be automatically enrolled in the All-Access 7-Day Plan and are not required to make a separate purchase. However, first-year students can choose to change to the All-Access 5-Day Plan instead, should that be the better fit.
