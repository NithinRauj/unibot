They partner with local schools; collect hundreds of items for holiday drives for a local orphanage, homeless shelter and other local organizations that support families; offer homework help at My Club, a group for children whose parents are or have been incarcerated; organized a clothing drive for children in local schools; and have partnered with the local Housing Authority to offer tutoring, snacks and STEM lessons to children in local housing.     #### Responding to family needs at IU East  Parents receive frequent communication from the program at IU East, asking them about any support they may need.  Their responses have led tutors and mentors to respond through helping parents with technical issues during virtual learning for students; including training on childhood trauma, bullying, and specific issues related to youth isolation during the pandemic; working with counselors at Centerstone who refer parents to set up tutoring and mentoring; and working with the 21st Century Scholars coordinator to try to create equity of opportunity for students to attend college.   #### Supporting the community through partnerships at IU South Bend  At IUSB, tutors and mentors have built multiple partnerships with the community.  This includes school districts, where tutors and mentors are embedded in classroms and also provide services in after-school clubs; local community organizations for programs and tutoring and mentoring services; and the South Bend Cubs, where local youth can work with baseball on coaches and get their homework done.   ### General questions  For questions about the program or to request paper applications to enroll, please email sscp@iupui.edu or call 317-278-0914.

    "body": "  ## Research and community go hand in hand  We’re committed to facilitating and conducting research that addresses pressing community issues. And we believe the best way to do that is to partner with people and communities.  In order to do so, we use the community-engaged research framework, a participatory approach to research and evaluation that includes those affected by the issue. Guiding principles of social justice, mutuality, and reciprocity are practiced through dialogue, co-learning, and long-term commitments to participation.  Community-engaged research practices are equity-driven and intentionally change-oriented. This means acknowledging issues of power and the critical importance of cultural humility throughout any research project.  To continue the momentum for community-engaged research, we partnered with the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research as well as schools across campus and created the Community Engaged Research Group or CERG.  Learn more about CERG   #### ENGAGE! Co-created Knowledge Serving the City  ENGAGE! is IUPUI’s first journal dedicated to community-engaged and community-based participatory research. IUPUI is recognized locally, nationally, and internationally as an urban-serving research and health sciences university.

    "body": "  ## Community Engaged Research Group   ### Bringing theory-building and research to impactful changed practices  The Community Engaged Research Group (CERG) is a multidisciplinary project developed through IUPUI’s Office of Community Engagement and Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research. Focusing on co-creation as a vehicle for change, CERG promotes collaboration between community partners and university researchers.  CERG aims to promote communal well-being by collaboratively approaching topics such as K-16 education, children (age 0-5), youth (age 6-17), criminal justice reform, immigrants, public policy, and health. CERG values democracy, equity through ethical reciprocity, social justice, and self-determination.    To see how CERG functions, one must first understand the importance of community-engaged research and its differences from standard academic data collection. While most studies provide a broad level of contribution to their respective disciplines, community-engaged research digs deeper through opportunities for knowledge and ethical practice co-creation and information dissemination.    By utilizing the Community-Based Participatory Research Conceptual Model that both filters and engages information through various points of partnership intervention, CERG emphasizes change-oriented results. This is in contrast to research projects which aim to merely observe and report.  Instead, data, research, and other information is continually shared and compared with participants as a means to proactively co-create new knowledge and strategies to address and positively shape the quality of life throughout neighborhoods and communities in Central Indiana.    In the end, CERG aims to provide enriching engagement opportunities between community members and university faculty, staff, and students that demystify research with the goal of improving quality of life for all people.  If you are interested in learning how your research interests intersect with CERG or how you can participate in CERG’s weekly interdisciplinary writing group, contact CERG for more details.   ### Contact us  Contact us to learn more, or to share your own research.

To ensure our efforts have the most impact, we focus on four areas identified by the Coalition of Urban Serving Universities .  [Coalition of Urban Serving Universities](http://usucoalition.org/initiatives/overview)   ### Building smart, resilient cities  We all benefit when the communities where we live and work are economically, socially and physically advanced and resilient. Research initiatives in this category help to make this happen.  Your research can focus on revitalizing urban neighborhoods or developing the region’s economy through the creation of new businesses, the transfer of technology, or the ability to rebound after a disaster.   ### Improving the health of a diverse population  Community health is arguably one of the most important research issues of our time.  Research in this area can focus on:   ### Fostering student achievement  The future success of our society rests on our ability to provide adequate education to everyone in our community.  Research in this area focuses on:   ### Twenty First century workforce development  Graduating students who are prepared for an ever-changing work environment is one of the challenges of higher education.

    "body": "  ## A long history of community engagement  IUPUI has been heavily invested in our community since our campus was founded in 1969.  And although the Office of Community Engagement has existed in its current form only since 2014, many of our departments and units have been actively involved with community engagement for years.   ### Organizing community engagement activities  In the early ’90s, IUPUI created a number of offices to handle various community engagement activities.  The first was the Office of Service Learning in 1993. It was followed by the Office of Community Service in 1994 and the Office of Neighborhood Resources in 1997.  In 2001, the offices combined to become the Center for Service and Learning.  In 2004, the IUPUI Solution Center was created to serve as the front door to the community to assist in the economic development of central Indiana.   ### Offering economic development solutions  The Solution Center focused on connecting the university’s intellectual capital with the pressing demands of business, government, and the nonprofit sector. Drawing on the talent of IUPUI’s faculty and students, the Solution Center facilitated partnerships designed to build human capital, respond to external challenges, and retain the best and brightest baccalaureate-and graduate-degreed professionals in the state.  In 2014, the Solution Center merged with parts of the Community Learning Network and was renamed the Professional Development and Corporate Education initiative in the Office of Community Engagement.   ### The Office of Community Engagement comes into focus  In 2014, the IUPUI Strategic Plan called on the campus to “establish a structure and leadership to coordinate engagement activities more comprehensively and strategically; leverage our significant community and economic engagement activities; support relationships with entreprises related to areas of university research, creative activity, and professional service; and help to build a culture of entrepreneurship at IUPUI.”  The Office of Community Engagement was created as a result. It integrated several offices involved with the community into a comprehensive, campuswide office.  In 2017, Indiana Campus Compact became affiliated with the Office of Community Engagement.  [Indiana Campus Compact](http://indianacampuscompact.org)   ### Centers engaging our community  IUPUI is home to dozens of centers and institutes that partner with the community and conduct research intended to improve the quality of life in Indianapolis and the state of Indiana.

    "body": "  ### A long-lasting partnership  IUPUI has had a longstanding partnership with the John Boner Neighborhood Centers on the Near Eastside. The center provides multiple services for the community, and schools and units across campus are partners through work study jobs, community-engaged research, service learning and more.  [John Boner Neighborhood Centers](https://jhbcc.org/)  Together, the community and IUPUI work to address significant challenges in the Near Eastside, including education, health and community development.   ### IUPUI engagement in the Near Eastside   ### A closer look at the Near Eastside  We wish to salute and celebrate our friends at IUPUI for the many ways they have deepened their partnerships with our Neighborhood Center and the community over the past decade.  Over the years IUPUI has become an integral part of our collective impact strategies to advance our neighborhood’s Quality of Life plan around the issues of health and wellness, education, community development, placemaking and research. They have walked alongside us and our neighbors as we continue our Near Eastside journey towards a more thriving, vibrant and just neighborhood.  Please take a few moments to explore the many important ways they are making a long lasting impact in the lives of our neighbors!   # EDUCATION   ### Providing workforce training for health careers  Over more than two years, 78 people completed the IU Health Careers Opportunity Program .  [IU Health Careers Opportunity Program](https://shhs.iupui.edu/community/hcop.html)  The program, a partnership between the IUPUI School of Health and Human Sciences , and the Boner Center, was a federally funded initiative designed to provide disadvantaged students with the academic and social skills to successfully graduate from health professional programs.  [IUPUI School of Health and Human Sciences](https://shhs.iupui.edu/)  IUPUI arranged on-campus site visits for participants, including the anatomy lab at the IUPUI School of Health and Human Sciences, and brought in speakers from the medical field.  As a result of the program:  Sherice Jenkins shared her story about her experience with the program.  I had to push myself harder because I had been out of school for quite some time. I knew no one else was going to do it for me. I had to do it for myself.

[Indiana Kids](https://comenga2.webtest.iu.edu/partner/student-achievement/tutoring-mentoring/index.html)   # HEALTH   ### Addressing infant mortality  Infant mortality is a key issue facing the Near Eastside, the community the Boner Center serves.  Best Babies Zone, a partnership between the Boner Center, IU Health, IUPUI, the Indiana State Department of Health and other organizations, is aimed at lowering the infant mortality rate by:  During initial asset mapping and conversations with the Indiana State Department of Health, it was determined that having a WIC presence (Women, Infants and Children) in the building would aid in connecting neighbors with valuable resources. Shortly thereafter, a spot at the Boner Center opened up and a clinic was opened in that space.  The center offers multiple services, including breastfeeding support, nutritional education and other community resources.  \"This allows WIC to better serve families in our area, and improves access to services,\" said Jon Berg, IndyEast Promise Zone Director.   ### Promoting community fitness  The School of Health and and Human Sciences' Physically Active Residential Communities and Schools (PARCS) is a health and wellness outreach program that provides low-cost fitness and wellness services to urban Indianapolis neighborhoods. Since 2005, PARCS has filled a gap that local fitness centers and schools cannot provide, due to limitations in funding and time.  [Physically Active Residential Communities and Schools (PARCS)](https://shhs.iupui.edu/community/parcs/index.html)  At the Boner Fitness and Learning Center at the Chase Legacy Building on the Near Eastside, IUPUI students and residents work on one-on-one health and fitness plans, along with group classes.  [Boner Fitness and Learning Center](https://jhbcc.org/bonerfitnessandlearningcenter/)  All PARCS locations are staffed by students from kinesiology and other departments across the IUPUI campus who are committed to making a stronger, healthier community.   # COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT   ### Learning community development  The Indy Community Development Network, a course offered through the O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs at IUPUI , spent time at the Boner Center to learn more about how a successful organization operates with a people-first mentality and what that really means.  [O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs at IUPUI](https://oneill.iupui.edu/)  As part of the course, students toured the neighborhood and met with local leaders to learn about the successes on the eastside and how a community rises out of tragedy.  The Boner Center is a great partner. They are at the center of a lot of great and important work, and are an excellent model for how community development work can be impactful, both on brick and mortar and on people.   ### Investing in public arts  Funded with a $4.3 million Lilly Transformative Grant , the stretch of 10 th Street between Beville Street and Sherman Drive, known as the 10 East Arts + Design District, will host many spaces to create, exhibit, and enjoy artwork in affordable, accessible, and culturally-inclusive settings.  [Lilly Transformative Grant](https://lillyendowment.org/stories/creative-forces-unite-to-move-a-city-forward/)  With high vacancy rates along East 10 th Street, the plan for the area emphasizes the potential of reinvestment in abandoned properties to increase opportunities for individual artists, art cooperatives, and organizations that promote and support the arts to locate and do business on the Near Eastside while making art more accessible to longtime residents.  The Herron School of Art and Design partnered with the community on a video installation project in a vacant building window along 10th Street, and are working  to make this an ongoing project.  [Herron School of Art and Design](https://herron.iupui.edu/)  An interdisciplinary team of faculty continue to contribute to the development of the arts corridor through the IUPUI Arts and Humanities Institute .  [IUPUI Arts and Humanities Institute](http://www.iupui.edu/~iahi/)   ### Assessing community data  IUPUI was part of a partnership formed when the Boner Center led the effort for the Near Eastside to successfully apply for a federal Promise Zone designation in 2015.  With that 10-year designation and other resources it brings, as of October 2019 the east side area has been able to secure 60 grants totaling $182 million. Those grants have supported local businesses and residents, redeveloped vacant properties, increased affordable housing options and offered programs and opportunities for local youth.  IUPUI has been working with community partners, including the John Boner Neighborhood Centers, residents and other community leaders, to collect data and do assessments of the impact of the ongoing programs on the neighborhood. The ongoing partnership involves the IU Public Policy Institute's Center for Research and Inclusion on Social Policy and the Polis Center , which are both helping to collect, assess and review data as required for federal programs.

    "body": "  ## Partnering with our neighbors   ### Our role as a member of our community  For more than 40 years, IUPUI has been engaged with our neighbors in the Near West , a vibrant and diverse community located just west of downtown and across the White River from campus.  [Near West](https://polisweb.sitehost.iu.edu/about/community-culture/project-on-religion-culture/study-neighborhoods/near-westside/)  IUPUI is one of many community organizations, schools, nonprofits, community centers and businesses that have long been involved in efforts to address challenges in the community and build on its many assets.  Over the years, partnerships with university students, faculty and staff have worked to address community-identified priorities, such as educational programs for K-12 students; building bridges to college; addressing health issues, such as infant mortality and diabetes; and improving the vitality of the community and the quality of life for all its residents.  This website provides an overview and shares highlights of IUPUI’s involvement with the Near West over the years.     ### Trends in higher education 2010-2018  36% increase in Near West residents with some college education  40% increase in Black residents with some college education  118% increase in Latino residents with some college education  The Mary Rigg Neighborhood Center (top), Hawthorne Community Center (lower left) and Christamore House (lower right) are three long-standing community centers that serve the Near West.   ### History of community engagement  After George Washington High School , was closed by Indianapolis Public Schools in 1995, IUPUI campus officials and community leaders began discussing a long-term partnership between the campus and the Westside Cooperative Organization, the neighborhood organization at the time. In 1997, the university formed the Office of Neighborhood Partnerships to dedicate staff to supporting partnerships with the community. This work is now continued by the IUPUI Office of Community Engagement.  [George Washington High School](https://myips.org/georgewashington/)  In 1998, a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Community Outreach Partnerships Centers grant led to the formation of the Westside Education Task Force. The group, which included university faculty and staff members, residents, community leaders, and staff members from neighborhood organizations, focused on reopening George Washington High School as a full-service community school that serves the students and their families.  [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Community Outreach Partnerships Centers](https://www.hud.gov/programdescription/copc)  Since the reopening of the school in 2000, the Westside Education Task Force has worked on initiatives related to education, including new schools, parks, and afterschool programs. PARCS , a fitness center program for the community, is located in George Washington High School and staffed by university students through the IUPUI School of Health and Human Sciences .  [PARCS](https://shhs.iupui.edu/community/parcs/index.html)  [IUPUI School of Health and Human Sciences](https://shhs.iupui.edu/index.html)  Through the partnership with IUPUI faculty and staff, IUPUI also offers teacher education opportunities, community service activities, service-learning classes, and scholars who work at the high school.  George Washington High School has been recognized nationally as a model for community-university partnerships, and others have strived to replicate this model.

[Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis and George Washington Community High School: Educating Their Communities Together](https://openjournals.libs.uga.edu/jheoe/article/view/855/854)  In 2008, IUPUI staff served on the Near West Steering Committee that developed a quality of life plan for the community as part of the Great Indy Neighborhoods Initiative focused on seven priority areas for the immediate and long-term vitality of the neighborhood: housing, public safety, beautification, economic development, education, health, and civic/youth engagement. Out of this effort grew an annual health fair, and the IUPUI Faculty Community Fellows program and Community Partner Scholars, which both served to expand capacity for community agencies. Fugate Scholars were also created to place IUPUI students in Near West schools to promote college readiness. In 2015, IUPUI was selected to be the convener for the Near West as part of the Great Places 2020 initiative, which focused on transforming six Marion County neighborhoods into dynamic centers of culture, commerce and community. Through this initiative, philanthropic, civic and private partners engaged with the neighborhoods to make significant social and capital investments to enhance quality of life and spur private investment. One of the key outcomes was the creation of the SOURCE River West entrepreneurship center.

In four meetings, community members were asked to define their preferences for design in the neighborhood and also discussed the identity of the area and how to involve local businesses. The guidelines have helped shape development along Michigan Street, west of campus, to reflect the character of the community.

[Indianapolis Met High School](https://indianapolismet.org/)  “We are so appreciative of IUPUI. Everyone we’ve worked with has been so helpful, with us bringing them a problem, and they help us develop a solution. They don’t just bring us a program and tell us to use it,” said Sheila Dollaske, Director of School Development & Innovation at Goodwill Education Initiatives Inc. that supports Indy Met High School.

An assessment by the Marion County Commission on Youth , or MCCOY, in partnership with IUPUI, identified strategies to close gaps between schools and community services and resources so students and school staff have the supports they need to succeed.

Alliance , reducing those disparities is their mission.  [R.E.D. Alliance](http://redalliance.org/)  “Our approach makes us different from other cancer organizations. We are very collaborative, we try to work with other groups to identify reasons for disparities, and try to partner with other groups to implement interventions and solutions,” Executive Director Lisa Hayes said.  Read more about the partnership  [Read more about the partnership](https://blog.engage.iupui.edu/2020/11/09/addressing-inequities-of-cancer-care-in-black-women/)   ### The R.E.D. Alliance in action   #### School of Nursing research  The IU School of Nursing has partnered with R.E.D. Alliance on recruiting participants for recent studies.  [IU School of Nursing](https://nursing.iupui.edu/)  Recently, studies have investigated cognitive impairments in patients due to chemotherapy for treatment of all cancers, and explored the needs of partners and spouses of patients undergoing treatment to further examine the impacts of a breast cancer diagnosis on the entire family.  Results of those studies can help R.E.D. Alliance and other cancer organizations learn how to better support both patients and their families.   #### Precision Health Initiative  R.E.D. Alliance has a three-year partnership with the Precision Health Initiative , involving the IU School of Medicine and IU Health Simon Cancer Center .  [Precision Health Initiative](https://precisionhealth.iu.edu/)  [IU School of Medicine](https://medicine.iu.edu/)  [IU Health Simon Cancer Center](https://iuhealth.org/find-locations/iu-health-simon-cancer-center)  In that partnership, R.E.D. Alliance helps develop promotional materials that are culturally sensitive, guides in the planning and implementation of trials and helps promote participation in those trials to the women they serve.  By recruiting participants for those studies, Black women can have better representation in research where they are often underrepresented.     #### Forming a support group  A study with IU Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health Professor Silvia Bigatti found that Black women and their family members were looking for support from people who looked like them and shared similar cultural experiences.  [IU Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health](https://fsph.iupui.edu/)  R.E.D. Alliance partnered with Pink-4-Ever, Inc. to create S.I.S. Support Group , specifically targeted toward supporting Black women and their caregivers. The group ranges from newly diagnosed women to long-term survivors and hosts monthly power parties for fellowship, sharing, education, speakers, activities, and a time to share and exchange information.  [Pink-4-Ever, Inc.](https://www.pink-4-ever.org/)  [S.I.S. Support Group](http://redalliance.org/initiatives/)     ### Connecting families with resources  IUPUI has an ongoing partnership with Goodwill Industries’ Nurse-Family Partnership program, supporting new mothers caring for their infants and themselves with a goal of lowering infant mortality. Through this partnership, nursing students get clinical experience with patients, and pediatric residents get job shadowing experience.  [Goodwill Industries’ Nurse-Family Partnership](https://www.goodwillindy.org/health/)  “We felt it was important for future pediatricians to go into homes with nurses, see inside homes, things they would never see in the office, and allow them to better understand the situation their patients face,” Senior Director of the Nurse Family Partnership at Goodwill Industries Lisa Crane said.  Read more about the partnership  [Read more about the partnership](https://blog.engage.iupui.edu/2020/11/09/learning-health-care-in-the-community/)     ### Improving health through partnerships  Goodwill Industries has been the co-recipient in three Community Health Partnerships through the Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute , including projects focused on:  [Community Health Partnerships](https://indianactsi.org/community/chep/)  [Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute](https://indianactsi.org/)  [IU School of Medicine](https://medicine.iu.edu/)  [IU School of Nursing](https://nursing.iupui.edu/)   ### Addressing a key health issue  The Fairbanks School of Public Health and Eli Lilly and Company launched the Diabetes Impact Project , a neighborhood-based pilot in three Indianapolis neighborhoods to address the high incidence of diabetes. The $7 million, five-year program is focusing on three Indianapolis neighborhoods with significant health disparities and high rates of diabetes – the Northeast, Northwest and Near West neighborhoods.  [Eli Lilly and Company](https://www.lilly.com/)  [Diabetes Impact Project](https://fsph.iupui.edu/research-centers/centers/cheer/diabetes-impact-project.html)  Work has included hiring community health workers in all neighborhoods who work directly with local residents and organizations, learning about key issues residents are facing and also distributing health-related information and resources.   ## Community development   ### Economic trends 2010-2018  12.5% decrease in poverty rate among children  31% decrease in poverty rate among Black residents   ### Improving the community  IUPUI is involved in multiple projects to benefit the community, including environmental research and beautification projects.  Students, faculty, staff and campus leadership have also participated in multiple service projects in the Near West, including the IUPUI Service Day in 2019, developed in partnership with community leaders who identified their most needed projects.   #### Projects around the Near West   #### Designing a new clinic  In spring of 2011, IUPUI awarded a grant to the Indianapolis Humane Society, and faculty and students helped design the Humane Alliance Animal Care Center , a vaccine clinic and animal welfare center in the Haughville neighborhood.  [Humane Alliance Animal Care Center](https://indyhumane.org/services/#low-cost-vaccines)   #### Restoring the environment  On the western edge of campus, along the White River, lies the Lilly ARBOR , which stands for Answers for Restoring the Banks of Our River, an 8.5-acre experimental forest designed to answer questions on how to reforest highly degraded wetland landscapes.  [Lilly ARBOR](https://blog.engage.iupui.edu/2020/01/10/cees/)   #### Climate change impacts  An interactive website created by an environmental epidemiologist at the Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health that shows how climate change will impact Indianapolis won a national environmental climate change competition in 2016.  [An interactive website](https://medicine.iu.edu/news/2016/03/environmental-climate-change-challenge-wang)   ### Boosting entrepreneurship in the Near West  In 2017, SOURCE Entrepreneurship Center was created, with the support of IUPUI, to help boost and support small businesses in the Near West. The organization serves small businesses, entrepreneurs and new businesses through education, planning and finding resources needed to support a growing business.  [SOURCE Entrepreneurship Center](http://www.sourcerw.org/)  Since then, SOURCE has served hundreds of entrepeneurs, small businesses and start-ups, by connecting them with resources that include financial assistance, classes, training and planning.  58 One-on-one coaching sessions in 2020  282 Total entrepreneurs served in 2020  78 Enrollment in courses in 2020   ### An international educational opportunity  Through a partnership with sponsors and the IU Kelley School of Business , SOURCE Entrepreneurship Center brought the UK-based PopUp Business School to Indianapolis.  [IU Kelley School of Business](https://kelley.iupui.edu/)  [PopUp Business School](https://www.popupbusinessschool.co.uk/)  More than 100 local entrepreneurs participated in the course focused on how to build and grow a business without investing money. Some had their first ever sales through the PopUp Marketplace and in the months following as they learned how to build their business.  [More than 100 local entrepreneurs participated](http://www.sourcerw.org/popup-about)   ### Valuing Latino-owned businesses  IUPUI has helped support the growth of Latino-owned businesses in the Near West, to help promote a thriving industry.  The IUPUI Office of Community Engagement and Kelley School of Business performed a survey of Latino-owned businesses in central Indiana and their impact on the community.  [survey of Latino-owned businesses in central Indiana](https://indychamber.com/hbcreport/)  IUPUI staff worked with local businesses on plans for investment and growth as part of the Near West Quality of Life plan.  4,873 Latino-owned businesses in Indianapolis  7,289 Employees at Latino-owned businesses in Indianapolis  $1.1 billion Earnings at Latino-owned businesses in Indianapolis "

Students can earn professional IT certifications that prepare them for the workforce or continuing education.  [IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI](https://soic.iupui.edu/)     #### Cultivating future leaders  The Center for Leadership Development, or CLD , cultivates pursuits of Indianapolis area minority students by engaging them in programs that stress career awareness, community service, leadership training, educational excellence and character development.  [Center for Leadership Development, or CLD](https://cldinc.org/)  IUPUI has partnered with CLD since 1979, and is an integral partner in their College Prep Institute, focused on college enrollment, persistence and graduation.  CLD participants boast a significantly higher graduation rate than their peers, and the number of students enrolling at IUPUI has consistently grown.  iDEW was what started me on that path, it got me the mentors I needed, they told me what college would be like, taught me skills to talk to people, and I met other students like me.   #### Starting preparation early  Upward Bound is a progam at IUPUI designed to bridge the gap between high school and college. Since 2013, the program has boasted a 100 percent graduation rate from its participants.  [Upward Bound](https://ub.iupui.edu/index.html)  Through the program, first-generation college students at three Indianapolis high schools -- Arsenal Technical, Warren Central, and Emerich Manual -- are provided support services to help them prepare for college.  Students can receive one-on-one mentoring and tutoring, visit colleges and universities, volunteer, meet other students, learn leadership skills, explore career opportunities and get the information they need for applying for financial aid and to get into the college they want.  Opportunities include a summer academy, field trips to museums and theaters, leadership programs, events with nationally-known speakers, workshops and job shadowing.   #### Scholars working in the Near West community  Fugate Scholars are IUPUI students who work in George Washington High School making college-related presentations. They also spend time in the community, translating for events and helping families prepare for college, including filling out financial aid paperwork.

[Essential resources for driving Community Schools Forward](https://www.brookings.edu/events/essential-resources-for-driving-community-schools-forward/)  Community Schools are places where educators, local community members, families, and students work together to strengthen conditions for student learning and healthy development. This framework for Community Schools includes the key practices, supportive infrastructure, enabling conditions, essential players, and guiding vision for all students to thrive. Developed by the Center for Universal Education at the Brookings Institution, the Children’s Aid National Center for Community Schools, the Coalition for Community Schools at the Institute for Educational Leadership, and the Learning Policy Institute as part of the #CSForward project.  Visit the Community Schools Forward Essential Resources for more information.  [Community Schools Forward Essential Resources](https://www.communityschools.org/essential-resources-for-driving-community-schools-forward/)   ### Better education starts with community engagement  For youth to succeed, learning must be paired with family and community engagement as well as genuine collective efforts to improve school climate and culture. That’s what Community Schools do. In this strategy, community partners collaborate with educators and parents to ensure that students and their families secure what they need. Services may include:  They bring community partners together to ensure students and families get the supports they need to help their children with learning, graduate from high school, and enter the world prepared for college and careers.  Community schools bring community partners together to ensure students and families get the supports they need.   ### Noted partners in the Community School movement  IUPUI is a regional site—UCLA, University of Connecticut, and Binghamton University among them—for professional development and technical assistance in University-Assisted Community Schools with the Netter Center for Community Partnerships at the University of Pennsylvania .

    "body": "  ## Partnering with Indianapolis Public Schools to foster future entrepreneurs  IUPUI BOSS Camp (Business Opportunities for Self Starters) teaches high school students to think like entrepreneurs, community advocates, and problem-solvers - with the confidence to try (and fail at) new things.  IUPUI BOSS is a partnership between the IUPUI Office of Community Engagement, IU Kelley School of Business in Indianapolis, and the IU Herron School of Art + Design in Indianapolis. The five-day BOSS experience guides high school students on a journey where they learn to vision, design, and pitch a business idea for cash awards.  Description of the video:  This is a vegan restaurant and it's Vegan Eats. We want to change the way people see vegan. I want it to feel like home. I decided to do this program, because I've always wanted to be a business owner. That's what I want to do and it'd be a great head start for me. The most important thing I learned is business planning; and how to actually build a business and maintain a business. I plan on going to college on a scholarship. I want to have my own business or I was thinking about being in the medical field. Overall, I was learning to be different. Really, just be different because there's a lot of the same things out there. They said, be different, find the problem, and come up with a solution to the problem, so that's one of the main things I really learned that I will definitely be taking home. Go out there and do it and find...find your passion! With the right mindset, it's possible.   ### Collaborating with campus and community for student learning  During BOSS Camp, BOSS students gain knowledge and confidence from IUPUI faculty, college student mentors, and local business experts and owners who help BOSS students envision, research, and design a future business.   ### BOSS Model  The BOSS model was created by Tim Scales, director of the IU East Center for Entrepreneurship in the School of Business and Economics . BOSS not only teaches business principles and small business start-up; BOSS students gain confidence in their abilities by learning the power of their ideas. Throughout the week-long camp, BOSS students explore creative solutions to problems, improve organization and communication skills, take initiative and manage their time and resources, and work independently and in teams – all of which are fundamental for future success.  [IU East Center for Entrepreneurship in the School of Business and Economics](https://www.iue.edu/business/entrepreneurship-center/index.html)   ### Location  BOSS Camp is held on the IUPUI campus, which gives BOSS students access to IUPUI technology and other resources, as well as opportunities to tour the campus, meet recruiters, and learn about college degree programs.   ### Thank you to our funders   ### Compensation  BOSS Camp is a summer job and a personal investment of time for the high school students, and BOSS students are paid a weekly salary that they may use to invest in their first business, education, or other passions. They also can win cash awards for their business ideas at the Friday Pitch Contest.   ### Application  BOSS is free and open to students from all four IPS district high schools: George Washington, Crispus Attucks, Arsenal Tech, and Shortridge. Each 5-day BOSS Camp can accommodate up to 30 students. Interested students complete an application, which includes parent information for students under 18 years of age.     ### 2023 IUPUI Boss Camp   ### Survey says  2021 BOSS students rated the curriculum and applicability to their future careers.  88% Rated the Overall Camp as Excellent or Good  94% Rated BOSS Camp as Excellent or Good when asked if it will be Useful to their Future Careers  94% Rated BOSS Camp as Excellent or Good when asked if it will be Applicable in School  94% Rated the Camp Content as Excellent or Good   #### Featured articles   ### IPS students make boss moves at IUPUI's BOSS Camp  By Amber Grigley, WRTV News, 6/12/2023  The thrill of creating your own business is striking the minds of our youth.

introduction and indeed i do feel very very welcome and excited to be meet with you today now before we get started uh one of the things i really like about your organization is yes i am an avid [Music] participant or shopper at farmers markets um my parents are from a southern state they were they they raised me in cleveland but they were raised in southern states uh and it used embarrassing so bad but we had always had a huge half acre garden in the city at our house and so for me the idea of going to the farmer's market and if you're anywhere in cleveland it's called a west side market back in the day when i was a child it was humongous what you call a farmer's market there and that's where we got all our fresh fruits our vegetables our meats our jellies and our jams and so i'm a real real advocate and i now live in a part of my in indianapolis where i have lots of shade trees the only thing i can grow is hostas the only thing i attract is deer so one day saying i'm gonna go out and give me a half acre and uh or until then i'm gonna be frequenting many of the fantastic farmer markers that are in the area so let's go ahead and get started and i love your logo i had to put it on the front page it's very very very very vibrant not only the vegetables the honey the flowers all of that yes i i really like it a lot now before we go into the courageous conversation the conversation part let's start with courage the key to courage and i am going to ask a few questions of you but first let me do this i'm going to do this very very quickly what do you think of or who do you think of when you hear the word courage usually what comes to mind if we're not thinking about someone of course in our family we think of heroes folks that through their courage changed politics nations saved lives did something significant that had a huge impact on a great enough amount of people uh you look up there on your screen to the left nelson mandela who in his and being in prison for almost half or more in his life came out and ended our apartheid we've got the pilot who actually took a plane and landed it and one way someone said it was a one in almost 1.2 million chance he was going to land that plane in the river i think the hudson river outside new york and yet he did it mother teresa same way someone extremely peaceful working in adverse conditions in her in her country of india phantom full of disease saving people firefighters who run in continually run into the face of the they know if they don't if they don't go in people will die and actually has the real prospect of killing them but they do it to save lives i think amelia earhart i don't go anywhere without my phone in my map quest right but she went into a plane and would fly over oceans without any idea as far as a map and all she had was a compass and she did it when basically there weren't any women or female role models courage we think also if we go back in the history of our country the aftermath of 9 11 and what happened in new york city and the individuals who were common citizens not to mention the paramedics and firefighters who save lives and also perish but common citizens helping each other out and finally let's think about what's going on right now in the wave of this pandemic so many front line workers whether they be in the medical profession whether they be teachers i actually saw a special uh last night on a news uh broadcast where police officers a great number of them are dying because of their being first responders in the era of covet yes when we think of courage we think of a lot of people but here's the question for you let's bring it on home let's bring it to what you're probably doing right now how courageous are you at work and i'll do a little bit of a poll a very quick poll and you can go into the chat and maybe i'll check the chat out here in a minute and see how who responds to this poll um but i'm gonna ask you this quick question more courageous and now i think i will go into into the chat who doesn't know i guess i will who's more courageous oh it says here the slides did not load are you saying that christina yeah for some reason it says resume slideshow okay let me just stop right now just refresh okay i'ma stop let me stop the share let me okay i'm sorry about that glad you caught me let's go into just a minute here no that didn't work we will get this okay can you can you see that no good okay let's do this they were up before and then and then they stopped okay so let's see what we're gonna do here you should be able to share i'm gonna do it now and share the screen and it's not there which means i'm going to open it again just one sec let's open let's go like this i'm gonna go to slideshow from current slide let me go here share screen can you see it now yes perfect thank you no problem let's see let's go to and are you seeing the full screen or the slides on the side the full screen fantastic so let's see if we can catch up well now the full screen is a full screen moving nope okay let's see here okay just a second before it's moving on my side let me just go here so one more thing there we go no now we're on panel now you're on panel let me see here okay let's try one more time let's do this okay what do you see now oh just a second i'm trying to do you see it you see it now let me see yes is it moving yes it is you're good now okay very good not sure what happened but you know what sometimes zoom can play some tricks on you thank you for your patience out there okay quick question quick very quick question out there among you and you can go on the chat to answer this who of you is more courageous are you more courageous or are your co-workers more courageous so if you out there and are you seeing the full screen here now i i see the slide deck on the side but okay well it works you can leave it it's fine let's see if we can do it now i wonder why that's doing that it just advanced this way it's fine okay anyway are you more courageous or are your colleagues more courageous and that's the question we want to be able to answer here who is more courageous well i'm going to go here and tell you something anyway let me get you oh oh the chest the chest is lighting up let me see co-workers co-workers co-workers co-workers who is more courageous co-workers co-workers beth you're right it depends but if you had a guest gina i should say bethesda's right who is more courageous i'm leaning that's what she says but i'm leaning towards well i'll tell you really quickly who is actually more courageous and what research shows and this is what research shows and i'm going to try to do it like this you don't see as much as the screen there we go on average on average research shows that employees think they're more courageous than their coworkers and the research is done on employees that's what we do in business we do research on individuals in business so 74 percent of employees think they're actually more courageous so if that's the case you might be asking yourself so why are you here why do we actually have this particular presentation why are you here if you truly believe you're more courageous why even have this workshop well here's the reasons why and once again i'm having difficulties let's do this there we go why are you here well you're here because to be quite honest with you the three hardest conversations we face in our lives are work related the three hardest conversations that you have are at your job and they deal with these things research shows for the average worker all right the hardest conversations 33 of them have to do with salary whether you have to ask for a salary increase or whether you have been asked to give one these are hard courageous conversations 31 of employees surveyed in a national survey said the hardest conversation is dealing with inappropriate behavior from your co-workers very difficult conversations to have even though you may in fact think you're more courageous and then finally and all these are really close together a third of the average workers believe that when you have to either give or receive poor feedback on job performance that is a stressful situation and it needs a courageous conversation now what happens when people have these courageous conversations well there is a huge emotional toll there is stress there is anxiety even just knowing the conversation is coming up 66 of these same american workers said they feel stressed even before they even have the conversation and then that is why many of them shy away from having the conversation the anxiety and stress prior to having it hey why do we shy away from this conversation what makes perfect sense of number one reason that we shy away from these conversations number one research shows is fear and what are the main causes of fear main causes of fear what are those causes of fear but for the most part and this is the same average american worker not knowing how the other person will respond causes a lot of stress causes to shy away from having courageous conversations 43 then there's an issue of communication 31 of the work of workers out there they're really worried about am i able to able to get my point across to the person i'm having this courageous conversation about whether it be about pay inappropriate behavior or feedback on the job another area where people are are our causes people to be fearful is i don't want to be in a confrontational situation how many of us get up in the morning and say wow i can't wait to go to work and have a conversation with a colleague and it's going to be confrontational this causes us to shy away from those difficult conversations and another thing that causes us and causes a lot of fear is we don't want to get upset or emotional and we don't want the other person to get upset or emotional that is tied almost with not being able to get the point across and being in a confrontational situation and finally we don't want to get us that once again and we don't want the other person to get upset if you put those two percentages together the vast majority of folks have a lot of fear and it has a lot to do with emotions so how can we stop this how can we stop all this fear and have a conflict have a constructive courageous conversation but first it has to find what is a courageous conversation and christina mentioned i have a law degree so what i always try to do is to make sure that i give foundational definitions so we're all on the same page for this particular workshop a courageous conversation is a discussion between two or more people two or more people you can't have this conversation just with yourself where number one the stakes are high so this workshop is going to be dealing with those conversations you have with another person or more where the stakes are high and you know going into this conversation that opinions are going to differ that people are not going to perhaps agree with you and third a courageous conversation stakes are high opinions are different will differ and strong emotions are present at the onset or before the conversation and finally strong emotions are happening during the conversation this is a courageous conversation okay now how can you have this conversation that knowing for the most part what people will deal with is conflict that conflict is where individuals opinions differ so you're having this courageous conversation when there is is conflict disagreement and most importantly what this conflict and please focus on this conflict is where there's a disagreement to which parties involved and the key word is perceived they perceive a threat maybe they don't even know if a threat is there but because opinions differ they perceive that there's going to be a threat to three things their needs or your needs their interest or your interests their concerns or your concerns a threat to a need is something that typically is quantifiable it's what is what you really really want all right and you think there's going to be disagreement that i want one thing and the other party wants something else now an interest a perceived threat to an interest is a threat to why you want it and this is really where conflict comes in why do you want what you want typically drives those emotions you're afraid that the why won't be satisfied and or there's a threat to your concerns or their concerns now i'm going to go through what i call a typical courageous conversation you decide i'm going to have this courageous conversation and you want to start out nice you start out nice you really planned it and then you get past the greetings you get into the courageous part the part was conflict and then because of that it starts to turn fierce okay and this is how it goes okay let's start with a small print here you start the conversation like this what's wrong here can we just get along and the other person says well you know no big deal i should just let it go there's no need to make a fuss well then you respond saying and this is where we start still crazes i was kind of hoping it wouldn't come to this but i guess i better speak up before it gets too late uh-oh before it gets too late what does that trigger the other person emotions and they respond well look before i hear what you have to say i'm gonna talk may i be totally honest with you and then you come back and your emotions and you say wait a minute thanks for sharing your perspective although you haven't heard the perspective you're saying now may i share mine get a little fierce in here the other person says well let me start by telling you where i'm coming from on this and then i want to hear from you what's the response i know it's going to hurt but i don't know how else to tell you this and anytime you hear i don't know how to tell you this you know you're getting emotional you really ought to know the other person says okay okay i have to be brutally honest here with you really honest uh-oh and then finally hey look i'm just saying what's true if you can't handle it that's your problem and by the way we haven't had a conversation there's been perceived threats all over the place no one has shared what is wrong and what is going on and at that point you have this a huge explosion the relationship blows up it's atomic and that's why people actually veer away from or fearful of having courageous conversations so i'm going to go through a series of slides and talk to you on how to facilitate and engage in courageous conversations where there are really strong feelings there are differences of opinions right and emotions are high now first thing i'm going to ask you to do in this is you got in um as an attachment from christina your conflict management style and i would say this is your conflict management preference your confidence management preference and if i could just for a second i'm going to ask you all to do something okay if you have a pencil or pen and a piece of paper i want you to use it and even if you don't have a pencil or pen i want you to use your finger and i want you to do this sign your name just sign your name on a piece of paper like you were signing a contract in the old days we used to have checks just sign your name and if you don't have a piece of paper use the hand that you usually use to sign your name are we all doing that give me your hands up give me a thumbs up are we signing our name out there thank you thank you lizzy i like that thank you thank you thank you just sign your name now take that pin or your finger or your hand and move it to the other hand and sign your name use the other hand or if you're using your hand sign your name now typically if i was there in person i'd be hearing groans and moans and head shaking seriously you know you did it jenny did you feel comfortable when you switched hands no did you really like how it felt when you switched hands no no now did you like how it looked when you switched hands no he says thumbs down and that is really bpc i like that face thank you anyway that is really now i gotta figure out where i was on the other slideshow here i'm gonna go back to the slideshow here there we go that is really the just of a preference a preference is what you do when you don't even think about it naturally so when we go through these five preferences in conflict management it's like being right hand or left hand if you had your natural preference your way and it's built on your predisposition it's built on how everything from values how your race your personality but if you had your way to handle a courageous conversation what style would you use and what styles make you uncomfortable especially if the other person is using that style okay so the very first style that comes up on that assessment you have is accommodating there are some of you all who are natural teddy bear a natural teddy bear now next accommodating folks and actually i call this a hoosier persona we are known in indiana for being accommodating and being very much into hospitality and what teddy bears do is they ignore their needs and they resolve conflict by focusing on the other person's needs okay they give in to others they're not very assertive they're very cooperative they they win the relationship and they lose whatever is the nature of the confrontation now teddy bears just like all teddy bears are wonderful to have because who doesn't want to be around somebody who wants to maintain great relationships however if you're having a confrontational or i should say a courageous conversation if you need to have a courageous conversation this conversation for the teddy bear will probably not be very productive because they're always giving in and if a person has a different style they may take advantage of the teddy bear okay now you may be and i actually i like this style because it's not me not by nature i want to say this a collaborative negotiation style is a preference for basically finding win-win solutions you focus on the goals and the relationships now i just admitted to you that naturally i'm going to talk about i'm competitive we're getting there naturally if i have my way i'm competitive but if you are going to be excellent at having courageous conversations you have to be right hand left-handed in other words i have to learn when and how to be collaborative because that might be the best strategy the best confrontational management style now the advantage from being collaborative and we all need to be collaborative to be the most successful and courageous conversation even though that may not be our preference is that both sides get what they want but the disadvantage is this takes a lot of time it does and it takes both parties agreeing to be collaborative if the other party is not going to be collaborative if the other party is going to be competitive this won't work so this takes a lot of upfront before the conversation the very courageous conversation to build trust but if both parties can agree to be collaborative you usually usually will expand the options to have a great conversation and and basically actually don't need courage because you'll have a win-win the next style is the competitive style and i said i admit if i have my way i am competitive i love sports by nature yes i'm a shark i admit it i'm a shark there are some good things about having sharks on your team it's good to be competitive it's the american way actually especially in business sharks put relationships however at the lowest priority and in business that's not always good especially if you have to work with these individuals on a day-in day-out basis the sharks have a need to win almost at any cost they come across as being autocratic authoritarian and uncooperative threatening intimidating now there's advantages of having sharks in courageous conversations and sometimes if you have a certain rule for instance somebody has to be at work on time there really can't be no collaboration you may have to be a shark in that confrontational situation so if your decision is right and being competitive then this is the best way to go but remember if you're a shark all the time in every courageous conversation no matter all right your goal you might bring hostility and resentment towards you in the workplace and finally there's this other style here and this is called avoiding and we all know folks like this oh no we're not going to have a conversation not at all no conversation i hear no evil see no evil speak no evil i really am going to avoid any kind of confrontation that takes courage or potential confrontation now there's an advantage sometimes to be a turtle sometimes you really want to maintain the relationship at all costs so you walk away and there's some confrontations maybe you should walk away it may not be worth the risk but the disadvantage is if there's real conflict there that needs to be resolved somebody's coming to work late all the time and you avoid all right that courageous conversation that person will continue to come to work late and be quite honest with you you won't gain a lot of respect even when you try to go back and have uh a collaborative conversation or competitive conversation the person just walks away because they know that by nature you avoid so i'm going to go with this particular screen and this is the screen and i know you have a pdp pdf of this and christine has it i try to tell folks if there was any uh a powerpoint slide that i would keep and put away in a drawer somewhere this is it it's good to know what your style is you now know what your style is but it's even better i think but you know when to use it or when to use another style so i'm going to show you really quickly this matrix that can help you in learning how and when to use the styles we didn't go through compromise compromise is usually a person who likes to go 50 50. so when should you use the style well if you look at this this quadrant here on the left side you see the importance of the relationship from low to high on the bottom okay going horizontally you'll see the importance of the outcome low to high so in trying to select a strategy or a management style and you need to prepare this before you go into the courageous conversation there's two things you need to think about how important number one how important is this relationship to me and the other person at the end of this conversation how important is it very very important or not important number one the number two as you prepare for this courageous conversation you think to yourself how important is the outcome and then you jot that down how important is the relationship how important is the outcome now using this this quadrant here if the relationship at the end of this conversation courageous conversation if it's not important to you at all and you really don't care very low importance on the outcome of this conversation it may be a good idea to avoid it i mean you don't have a relationship with the person and you don't want to and you really don't care about the subject matter you're going to talk about and near do they well why even have why even have this conversation okay that's not a courageous conversation that's an unproductive one next you think to yourself well wait a minute this relationship charlotte is extremely high at the end of the day i have to work with this person i want to have a good working rapport and relationship and you know what i really ah the outcome is not as important to me it may be more important to them but it's not important to me if that is the scenario then you are going to use the accommodating resolution or strategy for your courageous conversation you're going to actually lose the outcome give up something on the outcome because you're working to win and maintain a good relationship okay that's when you want to be accommodate within that courageous conversation now what if you say well the relationship is extremely high to me at the end of the day at the end this conversation i want and the other person wants to have a great relationship and we both want to have a good outcome that's when collaboration works up here with the wise old out this is a win-win we win the relationship and we win the outcome it takes a little bit more time it takes agreement from both of us but that's the way to go on how we work through any conflict we have and have a courageous conversation and finally that finally almost finally if you really don't care about the relationship at the end of the day think about the last time you bought a car from a stranger or you sold a car to a stranger or perhaps you bought or sold a house to a perfect stranger not someone in your family or friend the end of the day the relationship may not be as important as you're trying to work through who's paying closing costs or how much money you have to put down or what are you gonna have when car as far as options that the relationship is not that important you want the best deal and the other party wants the best deal outcome is very important to you the price is very important too delivery is very important to you now you're going to want to be competitive okay now you're going to want to be competitive and there are sometimes even within the workplace this is important however be careful see where this arrow goes to rob and khan and there should be a little corner here and competitors call unethical the unethical behavior become too competitive not caring about the other party and then there actually are things that are illegal like robbie and connie when someone calls you on the phone and says i got a great deal for you all you got to do is give me your social security number they don't care about you they just want a high outcome of your money now in the middle here is compromise you probably think that's a good strategy it's good it can be accommodating collaborative we can avoid it actually might even be competitive but be careful on a compromise only split the difference okay on something that's not going to cost you a lot if you're offering it and only accept the split if what the half you're getting means something to you so that's compromise alrighty are there any questions in regards to the strategies i'm gonna go here any questions okay quick question if for those of you who have a spouse or partner or even a child and remember the good old days we used to go to a movie what if that partner's spouse or child wanted to go to a movie and you really didn't want to see it but you went anyway i'm going to stop to share what of all these styles would you be using i'm going to go back to share for a minute would you be using accommodating collaborative competitive or avoiding and you put this in the chat okay let me see what i'm going to do here on the chat here okay let's see we got a chat it looks like a comedy oh yeah christina this is this is a smart group absolutely if you're in my class you all would have got 100 yes you would lose use accommodating um but let me guess you another question what if you did this time after time after time you always gave in right because you're losing what maybe two hours at a movie because you want a relationship with this person but what if you finally finally did this and then you turn competitive what do you think would have let's say you're doing it with your spouse or your partner and you're accommodating just to go along going along and then maybe after a year or two of these awful movies you say that's it i've had it i've always wanted to tell you i hate these movies i'm going to my movie what would happen to the relationship at that point stop sharing going to the chat what would happen to the relationship oh like that if you choose a dinner yeah compromising they would be mad at you yes laura remember that atomic bomb remember that i need to establish some boundaries yeah rachel it would likely hurt no it would actually if you did this for a long long time it would do more than that when people actually trust you sometimes when we accommodate and all of a sudden we turn competitive people are like who are you i thought i knew you i thought you were accommodating so what i'm trying to say with this is it's great to be accommodating and accommodating accommodating but be careful be careful because if you're too accommodating in business and in relationships and all of a sudden you have to be competitive a person will actually not trust you as much sometimes it is good to actually work toward collaboration and if you have to tell someone you gotta be at work on time and then all of a sudden the boss tells you look you're letting so and so slip and the next day you say to other person well i know i've been letting you come in to work late for the last two years but now if you come in late you'll get fired relationships are really ruined at that point so be careful with comedy and i say that because accommodating is what most of us are actually and a lot of us who are females especially we are encouraged to be extremely accommodating and then sometimes we have to be competitive and people really think what is going on here okay let's do this let's go with uh how good are you at reading people let's see how much time we have what we got we got to run so greeting people is this and you're in you're in a courageous conversation and you see this person how many of you all think that she's happy with how the conversation is going and how many of you all think she's not happy so if you're happy say happy not happy say not happy in the chat let's see what's going on in the chat she's happy happy happy well yeah happy happy somebody said not happy oh let me go back up let me see who said not happy [Music] marissa you are probably more right than wrong and you know why look at her eyes i teach negotiations there's one thing that doesn't contract or contracts naturally when you smile and that's your eyes when you smile unless you have a lot of botox and don't do too much botox because nobody's gonna trust you when you smile and you really need it crinkles of your eyes your eyes will crinkle your eyes will sparkle she is smiling and there's nothing wrong with her smile she may be smiling and let you know to continue talking she may be smiling in order to be polite but it doesn't mean she's happy and it doesn't mean she is agreeing with you so when you're having this courageous conversation make sure you ask questions even of the smiling face that's tip number one okay just ask questions and ascertain and make sure the person really is happy with how things are going okay and i know you've all seen this if you've ever done it you've seen your child or a partner spouse or friend you've seen a picture of them when they were faking that smile the reason you knew the foul would smile was fake because their eyes gave it away okay next uh what about this person how do you think the conversation is going for this person not so good well it's not going so good what parts of the face tell you that the conversation is not going well what do you see on his face can tell you it's not going well you put that in the chat eyebrows eyebrows eyebrows he looks worried forehead he's losing the game yep sweaty yep yeah this is this is a hand on the mouth this is that yeah eyebrows lifted covering now it could be there's no air conditioning in the room you'll need to check ray's eyebrows the hand on the mouth but obviously even his glasses are even foggy he's thinking but his body is giving away rachel he's thinking his body you're giving away potential clues of anger or disappointment because the body temperature raises when we're angry and if you look very carefully in his glasses they're fogging up that's and his face is a little red and even for dark complexion folks folks like myself when we get you know the anger comes up we get heated that's why that's what i mean by are you getting heated so this is a sign the conversation may be getting a little bit on the confrontational side and then finally what do you think about this young lady how things going well in this particular courageous conversation how many things people think on the chat that things are going well i like it leaning toward yeah a little tense you're right focused yeah very focused attentive smug you know something i like it complacent competitive this is the most difficult one to read you know what you all could be right this is what i call the mona lisa i teach my negotiators to use this because nobody can really get what you're thinking and so once again this is the one where you've got to ask some more probing questions make sure a person understands make sure there's agreement this is the best what i call whole professional poker face and i really do train people to use this in negotiations all right it also helps if you have to use it if you're surprised you don't show it if you're confused you don't show it it is called what i call the mona lisa so yes once again all the things you said could be all those emotions so that's why you need to ask questions and maybe change your negotiation approach very good now third what do you do like three what do you really want and we gotta move it just a little bit as far as the next step so one your style you know your style two you have to be able to read people three know the negotiation what it is you really want and also know that what you want may come through and show in your emotions are you overly eager you have to know depending on what you really want how does your body react what happens if you're stumped and you can't get what you want conflict and courageous conversation emotion is always there courageous conversation is an emotive sport sometimes your tensions tend to rule the more you know about what you really want the more you plan about what your strategy is going to be the more you understand that you can be read based on your non-verbals the better you'll be for your preparing for your negotiation next okay feedback and this is the one we talked about in the very beginning i think it was 31 time for 31 and 30 percent of folks have the most fear the most emotion the most negativity when they think about giving or receiving feedback on a performance so we're going to go there uh now before i go into this let's think about feedback this way i try to pick pictorials on my powerpoints that actually kind of display or represent that yes indeed feedback does help us grow but you have to be careful in your courageous conversation how you give that feedback and you also need to be just just as cognizant on how you receive the feedback okay so let's start out with this even though we know that feedback is a positive thing it helps us grow we basically for the most part avoid it and that's what the research showed so i'm going to give you some tips on how to give feedback in a courageous conversation and then tips on how to actually receive feedback so the conversation is very very productive okay all right first thing you want to do when you are giving feedback all right while you're giving the feedback is you clearly understand what is the problem take all emotions out of it what is the real issue maybe this person has done things in the past that maybe have gotten you emotionally hooked or bothered but is that the real issue okay when you give feedback you want to ground yourself and you want this is you most people are like you know charlotte tell me what to do for for the other person how i can control the other person the first person you have to control and giving feedback is you what gets you hooked the other person may know it are there certain phrases that get you hooked is it when someone rolls their eyes all of a sudden your emotions tend to go up what are things that are bothering you and getting you hooked and then you got to unhook or d undetached those i mean when i'm giving feedback and someone rolls their eyes i'm like say what no if they roll their eyes that's their problem we have an issue to resolve in this courageous conversation and i will not let that take me off track ground yourself if you have any assumptions and you don't have all the facts get rid of the assumptions any assumptions things like i know this person is going to be able to take this courageous conversation well because they are such a such a strong person they may be having an awful day or something at home tragic has happened or really you're making assumptions about how they're going to receive things what are your emotions and why deal with your emotions before you work with others make sure you write down i tell people write this down what is the purpose of this conversation and plan how will i start it there's really nothing worse i think sometimes to start a courageous conversation with how's the weather this is not about the weather i'm going to give you some tips too on how to do this conversation the next slide too as well i actually give you a script and then finally just make sure you get a sense of you know if i have this conversation what do i want to happen what will probably happen but maybe what will happen if i don't have it and if the answer is very little then you know what small relationship outcome right small outcome you need to avoid it now how do we receive feedback and receiving feedback and giving feedback i'm going to give you a scenario and this is a value statement that'll help you with both both of these as far as receiving feedback and giving feedback will help once again take a picture of this save this slide research shows it works when i coach individuals they come back and tell me it works i've had some of my clients use this on their three or four year old child at home or grandchild and they say it works write this down two sentences articulate your values and giving and receiving feedback with two sentences i am or i believe or i feel blank when you blank because period i would prefer that now i will tell you why this is so important these two sentences usually in a courageous conversation we're really ready to tell the person what's wrong so when i talk to my students i'll say i all right i am distracted and i believe you're being disrespectful when you come to class late because when you come in the door slams and makes a lot of noise and my students and our student evaluations tell me that distracts their learning that typically is where most people would stop you tell the person what's the problem but that's not a courageous conversation a courageous conversation is when you tell the other party what you would prefer now you have action so you tell the party what you feel needs to change because of why it needs to change and then you say i would prefer that if you come to class late you sit in the back row and be as quiet as possible if there's a seat and then you stop the conversation stop what you're saying that point and then you listen once again most courageous conversations turn fierce with just the first sentence so what's the other part is supposed to do but isn't it all about you wanting to change the other parties either actions or beliefs and you want to actually give them a chance to dismiss the conflict you do that by giving them a choice of what you want i would prefer that this is a very powerful way of giving and receiving feedback and additionally when you receive feedback make sure and i'm gonna go through the last six minutes with this when you're receiving feedback okay please pay attention to triggers we judge ourselves by our intentions and others by their actions make sure as you're listening to the feedback you're actually listening to the feedback all right and not reacting to the emotions that are attached to the feedback okay try to detach yourself from any internal triggers lean in and listen also too when you're receiving feedback we typically we resist it and this is where the courage comes in or people say i don't have the courage to do it because i don't think they're going to actually receive it we resist feedback if we think it's wrong that's natural and we often take offense and get angry because we believe it's wrong but see the questions on the right this diffuses the emotion and this truth trick trigger diffuses the emotion so you can listen more maybe turn away from being more competitive to be more accommodating or collaborative ask yourself these questions or two questions where is this feedback coming from is it coming from a real quantifiable demonstrative something that you know basically i did where is it coming from is it coming from someone who is been a supportive coach is it coming from someone who even knows the situation if they don't know the situation of course the feedback is wrong but you ask yourself these questions and then number two you ask is it coming from a place of appreciation sometimes people will tell you or give you hard truth because i appreciate the fact that you might change another person may be giving you the hard truth and feedback because they're trying to coach you and help you grow or perhaps this is an evaluation and the only way you're going to grow is to know the truth understand the type of feedback and then ask clarifying questions like where is it coming from is this appreciation are you evaluating me are you trying to get me to grow be sure you understand what the person is trying to tell you and then most importantly to understand the why especially in the relationship we also resist feedback we think the person is giving it they have questionable motives we don't trust their motives and they lack credibility because they don't know the facts so in those cases where you're resisting the feedback because of that we think the person is doing it because their motives are questionable or they lack credibility ask these two questions maybe both both of us have something we've both done something at fault here maybe both of us have contributed to this type of feedback that is questionable or last credibility so have i given any kind of input or my actions contributed to this feedback and the relationship type of trigger make sure you're clear on your roles are you my supervisor are you my co-worker are you my friend are you my colleague all right in this relationship what are our roles and are these roles inherently in conflict with one another that's a deep one are they inherently in conflict with each other as far as the roles all right if someone is giving you feedback that's questionable who's a co-worker what what is their role in this it was someone who's your supervisor what is their role in this is there a conflict there very important question to ask and then finally a trigger that help that makes us resist um feedback is when we feel attacked and we feel attacked on a personal level we're going to resist that feedback now even when this happens even when this happens it's very important to control your emotions and notice how you're feeling put on that mona lisa smile they're attacking you personally but you cannot lose the ability to focus and think you're you're reacting based on what we call the limbic part of your brain that's attached to your spine and that's attached to emotions and feelings versus the frontal lobe separate your feelings separate the story they're telling you and separate any feedback that you're going to get from your emotions this is where calm really comes into play i love you all our football fans i'm a huge football fan but back in the day when tony dungy used to coach the indianapolis colts and there was a bad call against his team i never saw him lose his temper publicly never did now those eyes could kill i'm telling them sidelines but this is where you really have to pull yourself together when you're being personally attacked force yourself to consider the struggles of the person maybe the problem is them and not you have empathy all right protect yourself with the truth but don't let your emotions play into it and then as we're coming towards the end you need to stop and listen feedback is the most difficult one of the most difficult ways to have a courageous conversation especially when you're receiving it so you have to listen it through don't think about the reply before you even hear all of it listen mona lisa face watch for your non-verbals and watch for the nonverbals 86 of communication is non-verbal so you've got to watch that and make sure you have fully understand the feedback also ask either beginning the conversation or at the end of this courageous conversation can you have the ability to ask clarifying questions and i would call it clarifying questions now i have some questions i want to ask you i demand to be able to respond and i'll say you know i need clarity can you help me i need clarity can you help me and then finally what about your comfort zone courageous conversations can be and often are uncomfortable but that's the biggest opportunity for grow and i use this picture because this is a real picture of a little plant that was in my driveway or very much similar to it impatient it was very similar to that the little sea fell on the crack from the year before a pot i had and it grew and grew and a little crack that little seed and that little plant was very uncomfortable but it was determined to grow even in a tight situation so yes it is difficult but there could be a great opportunity to grow and finally honest disagreement is often a good sign of progress courageous conversations usually are great signs of progress so i'll stop that now and give you all time to do questions and also say thank you for having me i know i want to go on a minute over and i'm sure some of you have to get back to work but are there any questions you all got courage now yes okay christina well thank you all this was one thank you thank you thank you ah all you are out there you're quite welcome i'm seeing some of the i'm seeing some of the comments in the chat you're quite oh

    "body": "  ## Working to better understand community engagement  It’s important to understand what we are accomplishing when we encourage our students, staff, and faculty to participate in community engagement activities. We need to know how it benefits our communities and the quality of life. We also want to understand how it affects those who are collaborating to effect change.  That’s why we undertake research with questions about the effects of community engagement.   ### The civic-minded graduate  To better understand the concept of civic-mindedness and assess the extent to which students who graduate from IUPUI are civic-minded, we developed the civic-minded graduate (CMG) model.  Pulling from a variety of disciplines, this identifies specific knowledge, skills, and dispositions to determine how students develop civic-mindedness. It also gives educators a framework to use when creating new educational experiences designed to increase community engagement.  The conceptual framework for the CMG represents the integration of identity, educational experiences, and civic experiences, and predicts how likely a person is to engage in civic-minded activities in the future.  [Learn more about the CMG rubric](https://csl.iupui.edu/teaching-research/tools-instruments/graduate/index.html)   ### The civic-minded professional  The civic-minded professional (CMP) scale provides a tool for research on professionals who contribute their time, skill, and expertise to others to achieve collective good.  The research project started because we wanted to understand the traits of these professionals in order to create more informed strategies to sustain and enhance this practice. This inquiry led us to define the concept of CMP and operationalize its attributes into a scale that can provide a reliable measure in the right context.  [Learn more about the CMP scale](https://csl.iupui.edu/teaching-research/tools-instruments/professional/index.html)   ### Let’s connect  If you are interested in partnering with us on a community engagement scholarship effort, we’d like to talk to you.

[Learn More Indiana](https://learnmoreindiana.org/)  Lean More Indiana offers a variety of helpful resources for all Hoosiers — from kindergarteners to adults — to turn their college and career dreams into reality.   #### 21st Century Scholars  Indiana’s 21st Century Scholars program offers income-eligible Hoosier students up to four years of paid tuition at an eligible Indiana college or university after they graduate from high school.  [21st Century Scholars](https://scholars.in.gov/)  In middle and high school, 21st Century Scholars are connected to programs and resources to help them prepare for college. Once in college, Scholars receive support to complete their college degrees and connect to career opportunities.   #### Bullying resources  Bullying has been identified as a key issue by schools we serve.  [Bullying](https://www.stopbullying.gov/)  When adults respond quickly and consistently to bullying behavior, they send the message that it is not acceptable, which can stop bullying behavior over time.  Parents, school staff, and other adults in the community can help kids prevent bullying by talking about it, building a safe school environment, and creating a community-wide bullying prevention strategy.

    "body": "  ## Advancing our region through economic development  IUPUI is one of several anchor institutions in Indianapolis—enduring organizations that remain in a geographic place and play an integral role in the community and economy. As such, we are conscious that decisions we make can improve the quality of life and economic future of the region.  Our university is committed to nurturing community partnerships with companies and organizations to advance our region’s economy. As the Office of Community Engagement, it’s our role to serve as the campus lead for anchor institution initiatives in support of university, campus, and community goals.   ### Supporting the economy through spending  Every year, IUPUI spends hundreds of millions of dollars purchasing goods and services, hiring employees, and supporting students. We work hard to ensure as much of that as possible stays here in Indiana.  In 2014, Greenstreet Ltd. conducted a study on behalf of the Indy Chamber that identified IUPUI’s overall economic impact in 2013 as a total of $253,661,313.  Here’s how that breaks down.  56% of IUPUI spending stays in Indiana  45% of IUPUI spending is made in Marion County  57% of IUPUI employees live in Marion County  50% of IUPUI employees making over $50,000 live in Marion County  50% of IUPUI students are Marion County residents   ### Revitalizing neighborhoods  In an effort to revitalize the neighborhoods around campus, we launched an anchor housing program which provides incentives to employees to purchase or rehabilitate a home near campus.   ### Sparking entrepreneurship  We firmly believe that helping small businesses succeed is an integral part of our role as an anchor institution—and a great way to help our region thrive.  We’ve partnered with organizations across the community to encourage budding entrepreneurs through every stage of the business planning and startup process. Community members can also draw on IUPUI’s entrepreneurship resources.   ### Join us in our efforts "

How? By making the right connections between community organizations and IUPUI schools, departments, faculty, and students.   #### Engaging in key community issues  Our students, faculty and staff are engaged with the community in key issues that impact families, such as K-12 education.

The program is a partnership with Indianapolis Public Schools that launched in September 2022 at Theodore Potter School 74 and Robert Lee Frost School 106.  Tutoring/Mentoring  The Young Scholars Program focuses on providing students in grades K-2 one-to-one, 30-minute, high-dosage tutoring and social emotional mentoring interventions. The curriculum approach used is Orton Gillingham phonics-based instruction as well as other literacy strategies. Tutors/mentors work flexible schedules, as they select the number of days and hours they work each week.  Hours  Monday-Friday, 9:30 am-3 pm  Goals  The goals of the Young Scholars Program are 1) to assist and strengthen children’s literacy skills, leading to grade-level promotion; and 2) ensuring children who complete the program are reading at or above grade level.  Program Completion  Children “complete the program” when their performance on pre- and post-assessments improve and when tutors/mentors, teachers and administration agree that they have mastered the necessary literacy skills to work at or above grade level.   ### IU Student Success Corps is Now Hiring!   ### IU College Students  The IU Student Success Corps program is seeking college students who want to get involved in their community and provide tutoring and mentoring services to students in grades K-12.

    "body": "  ## IUPUI’s Effort to Improve the Health of Hoosiers  We believe that a healthy community is a thriving one.  While Indiana is lauded as one of the top places to live in the US, we are not without our share of challenges. Continually high rates of chronic disease, obesity, smoking, and infant mortality are a consistent looming cloud over our communities.  As the state’s premier urban health and life sciences campus, IUPUI seeks to improve the health of our state by educating the healthcare workforce, providing healthcare and wellness programs to the community, and advancing the efficacy of care through research.   ### Educating the Workforce  With a variety of health schools and programs, IUPUI prides itself on educating the workforce of today and beyond. High-quality research, education, and collaborative efforts have resulted in the Indiana University School of Medicine being ranked 23 in the nation for primary care and the Indiana University School of Nursing ranked 37 .  [ranked 23 in the nation for primary care](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-medical-schools/primary-care-rankings)  [ranked 37](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-nursing-schools/nur-rankings)   ### Enrollment Across Health and Medical Programs  Despite COVID-19 causing record drops in college enrollment across the country, IUPUI maintained a consistent enrollment across its health and medical programs (School of Health & Rehabilitation Sciences, Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health, School of Dentistry, School of Medicine, School of Nursing, and School of Social Work). Along with this, the IU School of Dentistry has historically educated more than 80% of the state’s dentists and the IU School of Medicine educates more than 50% of the state’s doctors.   ### IAHEC Network  Outside of the Indianapolis campus, the Indiana Area Health Education Centers (AHEC) Network provides regional centers that assist in training, respond to emerging health issues, recruit minority students and provide continuing education. Nearly 3,000 of Indiana AHEC's students participated in both health workforce pathway programs and clinical training during 2022.  [Indiana Area Health Education Centers (AHEC) Network](https://medicine.iu.edu/family-medicine/education/ahec)  [Nearly 3,000 of Indiana AHEC's students](https://mc-42b990dd-5dae-4647-b81e-424724-cdn-endpoint.azureedge.net/-/media/files/2021---2022-indiana-ahec-annual-report.pdf?rev=7d246a382e6440cc954d19320a5079f6)     ### Improving the Health of the Community  In fighting the various health crises across Indianapolis and the state, IUPUI looks to improve the health of the community by providing direct patient care as well as preventative and wellness programs. Some of these programs are highlighted here.   ### IU Student Outreach Clinic  The Indiana University Student Outreach Clinic (IUSOC) is a free clinic which provides primary care-based medical, dental, social and legal services for uninsured residents in the Indianapolis community. This effort led by the IU School of Medicine helps close the health care gap in the community by addressing a wide variety of high-risk conditions including infections, musculoskeletal complaints, high blood pressure and depression. As an active and invaluable part of the community, IUSOC served over 1,600 patients and dispensed 2,700 prescriptions in 2019 alone.  [Indiana University Student Outreach Clinic (IUSOC)](https://medicine.iu.edu/indianapolis/service-learning/outreach-clinic)  [1,600 patients and dispensed 2,700](https://soc.iupui.edu/)  [prescriptions](https://soc.iupui.edu/)  When somebody comes, what we want them to know is that we are open for the poor, for the under-served and we are interested in serving the uninsured, the under-insured and working poor families who can't afford to have any type of insurance.   ### The IU School of Dentistry  The IU School of Dentistry provides a number of outreach programs including the Amish Community Dental Clinic, Healthy Smiles for Employability, and Shelter Sealant Program .  [Amish Community Dental Clinic, Healthy Smiles for Employability, and Shelter Sealant Program](https://dentistry.iu.edu/about/community-outreach-programs/index.html)     ### SEAL Indiana  SEAL Indiana is a statewide mobile dental program that provides preventive oral health services for children who do not have adequate access to dental care. From the program’s inception in March 2003 to the end of September 2022, SEAL Indiana has served more than 23,000 children in the state at more than 1,100 sites. Such sites include Title I (or lowest income) schools, Head Start/youth programs, community health centers, and city shelters for homeless mothers and children.

As of the end of 2022, resident steering committees in the three communities have funded nearly 30 projects to improve the quality of life of residents and worked with over 500 clients who experience challenges managing their diabetes.  [The Diabetes Impact Project Indianapolis Neighborhoods (DIP-IN)](https://dipin.iupui.edu/)  [funded nearly 30 projects to improve the quality of life of residents and worked with over 500 clients who experience challenges managing their diabetes.](https://dipin.iupui.edu/news-events/_news/nov22-numbers.html)   ### Your Life. Your Story.  Addressing the growing concerns of mental health on a local level, Your Life. Your Story. speaks to the estimated 12,000 Latino teens in Marion County who are suffering from depression and the 8,000 who have suicidal thoughts. With such staggering statistics, Dr. Silvia Bigatti took action to create a Latino youth summit that garnered 24 campers and 9 mentors in its first year of operation . The camp has grown to bring some of the self-confidence and self-worth building elements of the program to teens year-round.  [a Latino youth summit that garnered 24 campers and 9 mentors in its first year of operation](https://www.wfyi.org/news/articles/mental-wellness-promoted-at-latino-youth-camp)     ### Safe Syringe Access and Support Program  When Madison Weintraut started working at the Marion County Public Health Department as a student of IUPUI, she wanted to make a difference. Thanks to the support from a three-year grant from the Richard M. Fairbanks Foundation, Weintraut created the Safe Syringe Access and Support Program that provided community members with sterile syringes and harm-reduction kits. Since its launch, the program has grown to also provide HIV and hepatitis C screenings, immunizations, referrals for substance use disorder treatment, and has served over 70 individuals along with distributing over 300 naloxone kits .  [Safe Syringe Access and Support Program](https://marionhealth.org/safesyringe/)  [over 70 individuals along with distributing over 300 naloxone kits](https://fsph.iupui.edu/news-events/news/madison-weintraut.html)  When you take the time to sit down with people and walk them through why this type of program works, they can't argue against it.   ### Scott County HIV Outbreak  After Indiana's rural Scott County found itself in the national spotlight when intravenous drug use and sharing needles led to the largest HIV outbreak in a nonurban area in the U.S. among people who inject drugs, Indiana University's Responding to the Addictions Crisis Grand Challenge had to step in. The program brought together a team of 32 researchers leading work around stigma, new treatment options, prevention and harm reduction, law and policy, and the economic impact of the opioid crisis and how it is affecting our workforce.  [national spotlight](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6192548/#:~:text=Scott%20County%2C%20Indiana%20was%20the,who%20inject%20drugs%20(PWID).&text=On%20November%2018%2C%202014%2C%20the,to%20this%20outbreak%20was%20diagnosed.)  [Responding to the Addictions Crisis Grand Challenge](https://addictions.iu.edu/responding-to-crisis/grand-challenge.html)  [a team of 32 researchers](https://addictions.iu.edu/responding-to-crisis/projects/index.html)   ### COVID-19 Pandemic  While the health of the community has been an integral part of the university’s mission, 2019 saw a new crisis in the form the COVID-19 Pandemic. On top of providing multiple vaccine clinics and running mask making operations, researchers from the School of Science at IUPUI developed a fast and efficient COVID-19 biosensor . Led by Rajesh Sardar, a professor of chemistry and chemical biology, and Adrianna Masterson, a graduate student in Sardar's lab, the biosensor was able to analyze samples from 96 individuals in under three hours. If that wasn’t impressive enough, the system required only 10 microliters of blood compared to the typical 10 milliliters of blood required by a primary-care physician – over 1,000 times less.  [developed a fast and efficient COVID-19 biosensor](https://news.iu.edu/live/news/27995-fast-efficient-covid-19-biosensor-under)  Everyone is chasing high-throughput testing; this type of high-speed analysis is essential to the future of the fight against COVID-19. There are many advantages to our technology in particular: It's fast, efficient, accurate and unprecedentedly sensitive.   ### Advancing Care Through Research  Advancing care has been a part of IUPUI's tradition since its inception. In the mid-20th century, Indiana Dental College doctors Joseph Muhler and Harry Day developed a dentifrice that would be branded as Crest Toothpaste , one of the most recognizable oral health brands. Such tradition has continued through the exceptional grants and partnerships that have led to advancements in health research.  [developed a dentifrice that would be branded as Crest Toothpaste](https://iupui.libguides.com/c.php?g=746440&p=5346149)   ### Indiana University Grand Challenges  Announced with an ambitious $300 million investment in 2015, the Indiana University Grand Challenges Program was created to focus on three challenges: the Precision Health Initiative, Prepared for Environmental Change, and Responding to the Addictions Crisis.   #### Precision Health Initiative  Thanks to IU Health and grants from public and private sources, the Precision Health Initiative has invested in six major scientific pillars and partners with The Good Manufacturing Practice Facility which enables scientists to that will identify prevention and treatment strategies that are more personalized to an individual’s genetic, developmental, behavioral and environmental factors.  [the Precision Health Initiative](https://precisionhealth.iu.edu/)  [Explore the Precision Health Initiative](https://precisionhealth.iu.edu/)   #### Prepared for Environmental Change Initiative  Through the Prepared for Environmental Change initiative , IUPUI has become one of only five institutes considered by the United States Geological Survey as a hub for truly understanding climate change's impact on wildlife. Along with this, the challenge has spawned the Environmental Resilience Institute and the McKinney Climate Fellows program which has served over 64,000 hours across nearly 100 Indiana-based organizations centered on sustainability and environmental affairs.  [Prepared for Environmental Change initiative](https://eri.iu.edu/?_gl=1*8za1sv*_ga*MTg3MzYwMzQ4Mi4xNjQxODI0ODkz*_ga_61CH0D2DQW*MTY3NDczNjI3MS4xNjIuMS4xNjc0NzM5MTM3LjAuMC4w)  [Environmental Resilience Institute](https://eri.iu.edu/)  [McKinney Climate Fellows](https://eri.iu.edu/climate-project/climate-fellows/index.html)  [over 64,000 hours](https://eri.iu.edu/climate-project/climate-fellows/index.html)  Learn more about the Prepared for Environmental Change Initiative  [Learn more about the Prepared for Environmental Change Initiative](https://eri.iu.edu/?_gl=1*8za1sv*_ga*MTg3MzYwMzQ4Mi4xNjQxODI0ODkz*_ga_61CH0D2DQW*MTY3NDczNjI3MS4xNjIuMS4xNjc0NzM5MTM3LjAuMC4w)   #### Respond to the Addictions Crisis Initiative  The initiative to Respond to the Addictions Crisis looked to work closely with Indiana government officials and organizations and gather researchers from multiple colleges in medicine, public health, informatics, education to confront the ever-growing addiction problem facing Hoosiers on a state-wide level. Relationships with 160 organizations, researchers are working quicker than ever to expand clinical training capacity, conduct public health research, improve access to health services, and improve rates of harm reduction.

Fairbanks School of Public Health, created a study to properly research and record how the location you were born and raised within the city has more to do with how long you will live than your genetic makeup . Using the Monon Trail as the point of measurement, Staten's study went on to show that as someone moves down the Monon to the south, life expectancy drops. Such a major finding saw the rise in a need for activism to help the city’s urban core.  [how the location you were born and raised within the city has more to do with how long you will live than your genetic makeup](https://medicine.iu.edu/blogs/indiana-health/community-collaboration-key-to-addressing-disparities-in-diabetes)   ### Environmental Health  IUPUI Center for Urban Health , founded and directed by Chancellor's Professor and Executive Director of the Indiana University Environmental Resilience Institute Gabe Filippelli , is grounded in long-term health and sustainability in our community by addressing environmental injustices. Such practices include identifying pollutants and contaminants, promoting safe, equitable, and just access to fresh produce, as well as ensuring abundant access to naturalized green spaces.
