    "body": "  ## Meeting minimum enrollment standards  At IUPUI, undergraduate courses (000–499) must have a minimum of 10 students enrolled, while graduate courses (500–) must have a minimum of 6 students enrolled. If these minimums are not met, the registrar may cancel the course.  Note that individual schools may enforce a higher minimum enrollment standard.   ### Exceptions to the rule  The following are exempted from the minimum enrollment standard:   ### What happens if a course doesn’t have minimum enrollment?  Shortly before each semester starts, the Office of the Registrar will distribute to the schools a list of nonexempt courses where minimum enrollments haven’t been met. Upon reviewing the list, schools should:   #### Justifying low-enrolling courses  Schools may choose to provide a rationale for why any remaining courses should be allowed to continue with less than minimum enrollment. Rationale examples may include:  The registrar will review all responses. If the registrar determines that sufficient justification has been provided, the course may continue. If sufficient justification has not been provided, the registrar will consult with the school before cancelling the course.  Schools have the right to appeal the registrar’s decision to the executive vice chancellor and chief academic officer .  [executive vice chancellor and chief academic officer](https://academicaffairs.iupui.edu/About/Leadership)  The registrar reviews the list of approved low-enrolling courses regularly.

    "body": "  ## Request access to university systems and applications  If your job duties require you to use university systems and applications that provide access to student data, you must submit a request to be granted access to those systems and applications. This page covers requesting access to the Student Information System (SIS), the Indiana University Information Environment (IUIE), and eDocs workgroups.  To request access to university systems and applications other than the ones listed on this page, visit the University Student Services and Systems website .  [University Student Services and Systems website](https://usss.iu.edu/student-data-mgt/access-request/index.html)   ### Student Information System (SIS)  IUPUI uses SIS to manage student records. When you are hired, your unit will help you set up your initial access to SIS. If you ever need to modify your level of access to SIS, your unit’s access coordinator can help you make that change.  [initial access](https://dart.iu.edu/request/)  [Find your access coordinator](https://dart.iu.edu/tools/AccessCoordinatorLookup/)  [Find SIS training resources](https://ittraining.iu.edu/sis/index.html)   ### IU Information Environment (IUIE)  The enterprise-wide IUIE is a centrally maintained, web-based operational reporting environment that analyzes and reports institutional data according to specific departmental business needs.  You may request an IUIE account for yourself; however, having an account does not automatically give you access to all IUIE reports. In some cases, you may need to request access to a specific report from an IUIE data manager.  [Request an IUIE account](https://uisapp2.iu.edu/ie-prd/IuieHome.do?forward=Register)   ### eDocs  IUPUI uses electronic workflow to create, route, and process electronic documents (eDocs). Registrar eDocs have replaced paper forms in many instances, including:  When an eDoc is created, it is sent along a series of stops for approval before processing in SIS. At each stop, a workgroup of one or more people reviews the request and takes action on it.   #### Access to eDoc workgroups  If you need access to one of the eDoc workgroups mentioned above to perform your job functions, contact Erica Morrical in the Office of the Registrar at emorrica@iupui.edu . Workgroup members must be compliant with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).   #### Reviewing and taking action on eDocs  Your Action List in One.IU shows all eDocs currently routed to you for action. From there you can view the contents and routing history of each eDoc and take appropriate action.  [Action List](https://one.iu.edu/task/iu/view-action-list)   ### Financial Aid Item Types  Financial aid item types are created within SIS to award financial aid to charge to the specific general ledger account or serve as a placeholder for some awards. Item types are required to post an award.  Request a financial aid item type "

    "body": "  ## How course offerings are determined  Two major factors determine how, when, and what courses can be offered in a term: the course catalog and the academic calendar.   ### The course catalog  When a department requests a new course, there are many variables that affect the schedule of classes. Can the course be offered Satisfactory/Fail? Can it have a variable title? Can a student repeat it for credit?  The way a course is created dictates how it can be offered on the schedule and what effect it will have on a student’s record. For example, if you indicate a course should not be repeatable for credit, then a student who attempts to enroll in the course a second time will automatically receive a repeat warning.   #### Changing an existing course  To change the way a course is being offered, a department may need to submit a course change request through CARMIn. Note that routing and approvals can take time to complete. Until the catalog is updated, changes cannot be made on the schedule.  [course change request](https://one.iu.edu/task/iu/initiate-new-course-course-change-request)  If you have questions about how CARMIn values will affect the schedule, contact the scheduling team at schedlng@iupui.edu .   ### The academic calendar  IUPUI has different academic careers (e.g., UGRD, GRAD, LAW), and each career has a unique academic calendar. Courses are associated with a career and based on the term dates in that career’s academic calendar. Work with the Office of the Registrar to understand your academic calendar.   #### Academic calendar example  Here’s an example of the undergraduate academic calendar and how it affects the schedule of classes. Although this is an example, the rules covered here apply to all careers.  Undergraduate courses—and the majority of courses at IUPUI—are scheduled based on an academic term. There are three major terms (fall, spring, and summer), within which are sessions (e.g., first eight weeks, second eight weeks). Every course must be scheduled within a session.  When your curriculum allows, we strongly encourage you to use standard session dates.  Processes that affect student enrollment, such as eAdd/eDrop , work more smoothly for standard session courses than for those scheduled with nonstandard dates. Additionally, the Department of Education has financial aid regulations prohibiting certain nonstandard scheduling.  For more details about nonstandard session dates, contact the Office of the Registrar .   ### Learn more about creating the schedule of classes "

    "body": "  ## All about grade replacement  Unlike a grade change , which occurs only if an error has been made, a student can opt to replace their original grade by retaking a course. It’s the student’s responsibility to notify their school that they’ve taken the course a second time and wish to replace their first grade prior to graduation. Replacement doesn’t happen automatically.  The grade replacement policy allows approved undergraduate students enrolled at IUPUI, IUPUC, or IU Fort Wayne and seeking their first baccalaureate degree to repeat a maximum of 15 credit hours subject to school/division approval. If a student chooses to repeat a course and achieves the same or higher grade, only that grade earned on retake will be counted in the GPA and the credit hours from the original course will not be counted. A student must receive a letter grade upon retake in order to change the previous grade. The course that the student retakes should be the same course as the previous one, but need not be offered by the same instructor.  Grade replacement is not available for graduate students or students seeking any second undergraduate baccalaureate degree. Grade replacement is not an option if the original grade was assigned as a result of the student's academic misconduct. Once a grade replacement has been put on a student's record, it can't be reversed. Certain additional restrictions apply, so students should consult their academic school/division prior to invoking grade replacement.   ### Get more information about grade replacement  [Read IUPUI’s replacement policy](https://facultycouncil.iupui.edu/Governance/Policies-Resolutions)  [See student information](https://studentcentral.iupui.edu/grades-progress/grade-replacement.html) "

    "body": "  ## Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) codes  The Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) is the taxonomic coding scheme used for instructional programs in higher education in the United States. Its purpose is to facilitate the organization, collection, and reporting of fields of study and program completions.  The CIP is the accepted federal government statistical standard on instructional program classifications and is used in a variety of education surveys and databases, giving higher education institutions the ability to make comparisons to peer institutions.   ### What is a CIP code and how is it used?  The CIP code is a six-digit number (xx.xxxx) that identifies instructional programs. The first two digits represent the most general grouping of related programs and are meant to encompass all instructional programs offered by all institutions of higher education in the United States. The four-digit code represents a more specific program within the general grouping, and the six-digit code is the most detailed program classification, representing a very specific instructional field of study.  The CIP titles and program descriptions are intended to be generic categories into which program completion data can be placed, not exact duplicates of specific majors or field of study titles used by individual institutions.   ### Assignment of CIP codes at IUPUI  A key part of a proposal for a new academic program is the selection of an appropriate CIP code based on the anticipated curriculum. It is important to ensure accurate assignment of a CIP code to each new program so that reports comparing IUPUI with other institutions provide an accurate comparison of similar programs.  The CIP code chosen for a new program will be evaluated during the proposal approval process. When a new program has received final approval from the Indiana Commission for Higher Education , the CIP code and program title are added to the state’s Academic Program Inventory , the official inventory of programs offered by higher education institutions in Indiana.  [Indiana Commission for Higher Education](https://www.in.gov/che/)  [Academic Program Inventory](https://transferin.net/transfer-resources/transfer-databases/academic-program-inventory/)   #### Find out more about selecting a CIP code  The National Center for Education Statistics’ CIP User Site provides detailed information about CIP codes, including a listing of all current CIP codes.  [Visit the CIP User Site](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cipcode/default.aspx?y=55)   ### CIP code resources at IUPUI  At IUPUI, CIP codes are stored in the Student Information System . A list of the CIP codes associated with current academic plans is available in the Indiana University Information Environment and can most easily be accessed through these reports:  [Student Information System](https://one.iu.edu/task/iu/student-information-system)  [Indiana University Information Environment](https://uisapp2.iu.edu/ie-prd/index.html)  You can also search the IU Academic Program Inventory , the official list of academic programs and associated CIP codes on all IU campuses.

    "body": "  ## What happens when a student registers late  Students can register or drop and add classes through the end of the first week of each semester for a full-semester class. During this time, a student can register for or add your course without your signature if space is available and no authorizations are required. Any student who does so will show up on your next roster . If space is available but authorizations are required, the student will need to contact the school or department to get approval to enroll.   ### Waitlists  Students may be placed in your course by the automated waitlist system, which generally runs through the third day of the semester. If the student hasn’t been placed by the morning of the fourth day of the term, it will be up to you to decide whether to allow the student to enroll as an overload to your section.  Note that a student cannot waitlist a course which requires authorization unless there is an authorization in the system for that student.   ### Overloading a course  If you choose to admit a student as an overload, you’ll need to sign a drop/add form. The student should get the form from their school recorder or advisor. After they’ve collected the required signatures, it’s their responsibility to submit the form to the Office of the Registrar.  Drop/add forms will be processed after waitlist placement ends to ensure a student using this method doesn’t skip ahead of any waitlisted student.   ### Late add  After the first week of the semester, students must request approval to add your class.   ### Find more enrollment information "

Students who don’t meet these criteria are instructed to contact the department offering the course to find out what’s required to become eligible to take the course.  There are four types of restrictions.   ### Class permissions  During registration, any class that requires specific approval for a student to enroll will have department consent assigned. Departments should have information in the class note telling students where to obtain permission. Any student may seek permission to take the class. Departments may occasionally use class permissions to allow a student to enroll in a closed class.   ### School code authorizations/permissions  Classes are sometimes restricted to students who are enrolled in the school offering the course. A student who is not enrolled in the school may seek permission to take the class.   ### Class standing restrictions  In some cases, departments require students to have a certain class standing (e.g., sophomore, junior) to register for a class. Students whose standing doesn’t meet the minimum requirement may seek permission to take the class.   ### Career (level) restrictions  Undergraduate students are restricted from registering in graduate-level courses without specific permission from the graduate course department. This restriction is in place for two reasons:   ### How to grant class permissions  University Information Technology Services IT Training provides resources that walk you through granting permissions in the Student Information System (SIS) .

The Office of the Registrar handles scheduling of classroom space for special events.  Depending on the category your meeting or event falls into, there may be a fee associated with classroom rental. (Note that being an IUPUI employee or a member of an external group will not affect the reservation fee charged to the group.)   ### Category I: Internal (no charge)   ### Category II: External (reduced rate)   ### Category III: External (full rate)  Space cannot be used for nonuniversity fundraising or for religious services.

The academic program approval process is based on the process for developing and offering a new degree program; however, the process also applies to the creation of other types of academic programs (e.g., certificate programs) as well as to modifications of existing academic programs.   ### IU Academic Program Inventory  The IU Academic Program Inventory is the official list of academic programs on all IU campuses, including IUPUI (CAS authentication required).

The request will be routed to all required approvers.  [eSpecial Credit](https://one.iu.edu/task/iu/especial-credit)  If there are fees associated with special credit, the student will be required to approve the request. They will receive email at their university email address notifying them how to proceed.  [university email address](https://studentcentral.iupui.edu/personal-information/university-email.html)  After the request has been approved and the credit posted to the student’s record, both the request initiator and the student will receive an email confirmation. The credits will appear on the student’s transcript, and any fees will be posted to the student’s bursar account.  If a request isn’t fully approved within 120 days, it will be cancelled automatically.   ### Special credit on the transcript  Special credit appears on the student’s transcript for the semester it was awarded. It’s headed “Indiana University Special Credit” regardless of whether the student is in an IU or Purdue degree program and regardless of whether an IU or Purdue department is awarding the credit.   ### Awarding special credit for proficiency  Students can receive special credit for testing out of a class or for life or job experience, personal skills or talents, or other demonstrations of proficiency. Academic departments have the option to grant course credit on a case-by-case basis.  Departments establish their own academic standards and evaluation methods. To establish their skill level, students may be required to:  A department will generally grade work for a special credit S for satisfactory or else choose not to award special credit. In exceptional circumstances, the department may opt to award the student an A for outstanding work.  However, the A will not be used in computing GPA.  Sometimes a department may waive a student’s requirement to take a particular course. However, overall degree requirements remain, and students must complete another course to earn enough total hours to graduate.

Current special credit fees are charged in cases where the exam was taken in a preceding year.   #### Credentials or experience  If special credit is awarded as a result of credentials or experience, $20 per credit hour will be assessed (up to a maximum of $100 per course).   ### Questions?

    "body": "  ## Building a schedule of classes requires a strict timeline  It takes a lot to put together a schedule of classes—from coordinating faculty schedules to determining what courses are needed. This is why the Office of the Registrar works hard to give units as much time as possible to edit a term’s schedule build.  Best practice—for everyone—is to have an accurate schedule of classes completed in time for room scheduling.  A schedule build occurs in stages. We’ve listed here the major periods that make up the build process. Specific dates are shared with schedulers when the distributed schedule is released for editing.   ### Prior term copy  Each schedule begins with a copy of the most recent like term (fall gets copied to fall, spring to spring.) For IUPUI, this process occurs in the second month of the term.  The Office of the Registrar takes a few weeks to make important preliminary edits to this copy before releasing the distributed schedule to departments.   ### Full edit access  The schedule opens for full editing by departments. Departments typically have five months of full edit access.   ### Room scheduling  Full edit access ends when room scheduling begins. During this time, no edits to the schedule are allowed.   ### Limited edits  After initial room assignments have been made, the schedule is reopened for limited editing access. During this period, changes which affect day and time or add additional sections may be prohibited or put into a tentative status pending room availability. Many other fields also become restricted during this period. Changes must be coordinated with the Office of the Registrar .   ### Schedule publishing  The schedule is published online so students can prepare for registration. At this time, edits to certain values may be prohibited or cautioned. For example, course attribute changes now may affect a student’s degree progress.   ### Enrollment/Registration  Once enrollment begins for a term, changes to the schedule of classes become very difficult to accommodate for both students and administrators.  For example, after a student has enrolled in an online course, changing to an in-person instruction mode could cause major difficulty for their schedule.  Administratively, adjustments during this period require the Office of the Registrar to process complex changes, communicate with affected students, revisit classroom assignments, and coordinate with the bursar and Office of Student Financial Services on financial adjustments.  Please be judicious in any changes to your schedule after enrollment begins.   ### Learn more about creating the schedule of classes "

    "body": "  ## How instructional classrooms are assigned  The Office of the Registrar is a steward for ensuring that IUPUI manages physical resources in alignment with institutional goals. The office is responsible for effective use of all instructional classrooms, even those scheduled by individual departments.   ### Your responsibilities  Departments play a role in the scheduling of both registrar-controlled classrooms and departmentally controlled classrooms.   #### Registrar-controlled classrooms  Many classrooms are scheduled by the registrar. In order to meet campus use expectations in all rooms, it’s critical for departments to provide a complete schedule by the room scheduling deadlines .  A portion of registrar-controlled rooms have established priority assignment agreements for particular departments. Units are given priority only when they meet schedule build timelines and factors such as class size compared to room capacity are considered. This does not give a unit exclusive use or the right to bump another department’s course from a room.   #### Departmentally controlled classrooms  Some academic units have classrooms they’re responsible for scheduling. Departments must communicate to the registrar the scheduling of those rooms in the distributed schedule of classes .  Departments are expected to assign their space to the fullest extent possible, which may include scheduling space for users outside of the department.  The registrar maintains information about classroom assignments regardless of who controls them, for three important reasons:   ### General rules of classroom assignments  The registrar makes every effort to best match rooms with course needs. This takes into account factors such as:  In order to provide effective course scheduling and make best use of classroom space, two scheduling guidelines are of note.   #### Standard time modules  The best way to offer the most efficient, effective classroom scheduling is for departments to distribute course offerings within the standard time modules . This is also the most efficient way to ensure that classes meet minimum instructional minutes .   #### Prime and non–prime time  Unfortunately, not everyone can schedule their classes at the most desired times because of classroom space issues. Additionally, we need to make it possible for students to create a conflict-free schedule.  For these reasons, there are guidelines about distributing your department’s offerings across both prime and non–prime days and times. While this is a good practice for all classroom space, it is required for classes scheduled in registrar-controlled classrooms. Departments using registrar-controlled classrooms must schedule 55 percent or less of their offerings druing prime time and 45 percent or more during non–prime time.   #### Prime time  Prime time includes all standard time module offerings scheduled during these times:  Note that prime time may change based on shifts in classroom demand. The registrar will notify departments if there is a change.   #### Non–prime time  Non–prime time includes all standard module instruction minutes scheduled during these times:   #### Nonstandard times  Classes that are scheduled outside of standard time modules are automatically considered nonstandard. These nonstandard times are extremely difficult to accommodate for classroom assignments. However, sometimes a nonstandard format is necessary based on pedagogical requirements.   ### The complete rules  This page covers the highlights of IUPUI’s instructional space assignment rules. The full text of the rules follows. (Enforced beginning with fall 2011 schedule build. Approved by the chancellor in October 2010.)   #### Definition: General inventory classrooms  General inventory classrooms are the complete inventory of campus rooms that are used for instructional activities. These rooms are officially designated as general classrooms with IU Space Information . This overall inventory consists of classrooms controlled (assigned) by the registrar and classrooms controlled (assigned) by academic units.

If you give an exam, it must be held on the day and time published on this page.  The week before finals is free of major or final exams, except for practical tests at the end of lab periods. However, if you have assigned a project well in advance, it may be due during this week.   ### When are final exams?  Check the lists on this page to find out when exams are scheduled.  Note that some course and departmental final exam times differ from the standard class final exam times. Be sure to check both lists as you’re planning for your finals.   #### Traffic alert  Keep in mind that events in the area may require you to allow extra travel and parking time.

    "body": "  ## How registration appointments are assigned  The steps for initial enrollment for a term depend on a student’s status.   ### New students  Newly admitted students are instructed to schedule an orientation session. During that time, the new student will register for classes with the assistance of an academic advisor.   ### Current students  Currently enrolled students will receive a registration appointment time based on their class standing. This helps ensure that students who need a class the most are schedule to register first.  The registrar will notify students of their scheduled time, and students can also find their registration appointment in the Student Center in One.IU. Currently enrolled students may register any time after their scheduled appointment time. This current student registration period lasts six days.  [Student Center](https://one.iu.edu/task/iu/student-center)   #### Current student registration   ### Transfer, intercampus, and returning students  Transfer, intercampus, and returning students will be able to register during open registration. This is the time period immediately following currently enrolled student appointments up until the end of the first week of classes. No appointment is needed. Students should register for classes in One.IU.  [register for classes](https://one.iu.edu/task/iu/register-for-classes)   ### Registration problems  For all students, there can be no holds on their records that would otherwise prevent registration. If there are holds (such as a past due bill or an immunization hold), the student will need to resolve them before attempting to register.

    "body": "  ## How to determine undergraduate academic credit units for your course  A student receives a unit of academic credit when one of the following is true:  Generally, one unit of credit equals three hours of in-class and out-of-class work per week (a Carnegie Unit of credit). At IUPUI, an hour is defined as 50 minutes, and a 3 credit class must meet for a minimum of 2,250 minutes (excluding the final exam).  [Carnegie Unit](https://www.carnegiefoundation.org/faqs/carnegie-unit/)  As new class delivery methods emerge, it becomes necessary to determine a unit of credit not based on time. These courses shall use demonstration of competency or proficiency, or fulfillment of learning outcomes to ensure the equivalence of traditionally delivered courses.   ### Academic credit standards  These standards for a unit of academic credit may be modified only when necessary to fulfill requirements of an accreditation agency. If modification is required, then these standards should be treated as minimum requirements.  These requirements were approved by the IUPUI Academic Affairs Committee on April 6, 2001.   #### Traditional delivery methods  For traditional delivery methodologies in a major semester, one unit of undergraduate academic credit equals one of the following:  For traditional delivery methodologies other than major semesters, total hours shall equal the above guidelines.   #### Nontraditional, synchronous delivery methods  For nontraditional, synchronous delivery methodologies, one unit of undergraduate academic credit equals one hour of lecture or student/faculty interaction and two hours of study.  Synchronous delivery methodologies include but are not limited to:   #### Nontraditional, asynchronous delivery methods  For nontraditional, asynchronous delivery methodologies, one unit of undergraduate academic credit shall be determined by one of the following:  Asynchronous delivery methodologies include but are not limited to:   #### Educational activities that aren’t directly supervised  For internships, student teaching, independent study, and like educational activities which are not under the direct supervision of an IUPUI faculty member, one unit of undergraduate academic credit is commensurate with the hours involved and quality of the learning experience and is determined by the credit-awarding unit.  Academic credit is awarded when the student fulfills the objectives and/or obtains the required competencies as set by the credit-awarding unit.   #### Supervised research and other activities  For supervised undergraduate research and similar activities, the amount of effort required for one unit of undergraduate academic credit is determined by the supervising faculty and/or advisory committee.   #### Special credit  Special credit may be awarded to degree-seeking IUPUI students who possess, by previous education or experience, a background in a discipline represented by an IUPUI program. The categories under which students are awarded credit are:  Each school and many disciplines have different policies that define how these mechanisms apply to students seeking credit.   ### Learn more about course creation "

    "body": "  ## Your role in creating the schedule of classes  For the IUPUI registrar to create each semester’s course offerings, departments must provide detailed information on enrollment limits, instructors, meeting information, enrollment restrictions, and more.  The Office of the Registrar uses a distributed schedule of classes (dSOC) to give units the most flexibility and control over their schedule. Each term’s schedule begins with a copy of the previous matching term (e.g., next fall’s schedule starts with a copy of the previous fall’s schedule). Departments review this prior term copy, correcting information and adding new classes directly in the Student Information System (SIS) .  [the Student Information System (SIS)](https://one.iu.edu/task/iu/student-information-system)  There are many policy and operational requirements that drive the schedule of classes and which affect financial aid, the bursar, campus space, advising, and degrees. This site gives an overview of these policies, but you can find details at Registrar Academic Support .  [Registrar Academic Support](https://uisapp2.iu.edu/confluence-prd/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=REGSUPPORT&title=IUPUI+Registrar+Academic+Support+Home)  Providing an accurate, on-time schedule has a tremendous effect on student retention and persistence to graduation.   ### Get help with the dSOC  Throughout the build process, the Office of the Registrar is available to assist. We also provide training for new schedulers, both one-on-one and through resources offered at Registrar Academic Support .
