    "body": "  ## Roaring strong together  The Jaguar Coping and Resilience Team—what we call JagsCARE—provides immediate and short-term support and interventions for those involved in a potentially traumatic event or critical incident.  The goals of the support and interventions are to:  To request support from the JagsCARE team, contact Counseling and Psychological Services.   ### Contact CAPS  Monday–Friday, 9 a.m.–4 p.m. 317-274-2548 capsindy@iupui.edu Lockefield Village, second floor 980 Indiana Ave.  CAPS’ email is not monitored after business hours. Please do not use in emergencies.     ### Become a member of the JagsCARE team  You do NOT need to have any prior training or experience in providing mental health support services. JagsCARE interventions will sometimes take place outside of normal business hours, to help ensure that impacted people are able to attend. The actual time commitment varies by semester, depending on the number of incidents that occur.  Counseling and Psychological Services will offer JagsCARE training during the academic year. If you are interested in participating—or have questions before deciding—please reach out to:   #### Learn more about JagsCARE   ##### Who is a part of JagsCARE?  JagsCARE team members are IUPUI faculty and staff members. They receive regular training and support from our Counseling and Psychological Services team.   ##### Who is eligible to receive help from JagsCARE?  Anyone in our campus community can request and receive support from the JagsCARE team, including students, faculty, staff, emergency workers, and/or family members of those affected by the critical incident.   ##### How can the interventions help?  JagsCARE interventions and support aim to help individuals:   ### After a crisis: What to expect and what to do   #### You are not alone.  You have experienced an unusually stressful and traumatic event. In such situations, our typical coping mechanisms may be overwhelmed. Those things you usually do to manage daily stressors may simply not work. You may experience symptoms of distress and impaired functioning that you have never experienced before.   #### After a traumatic event  A critical incident occurs when an individual experiences or witnesses a threat to or loss of life, emotional safety, or way of living. Critical incidents have a profound impact on how we view the world. Thoughts, emotions, and actions surrounding the event are often difficult to recall and a sense of confusion may result. You may feel:  Some people may also have difficulty sleeping, a decreased appetite, and other physical symptoms. You may struggle to focus, concentrate, and complete tasks.  Regarding the event, you may experience:   #### Grief and loss  Traumatic events are often accompanied by death or loss of community, relationships, or sense of safety. Everyone feels grief in their own way, and there is no \"right way\" to grieve. Individual grief reactions may also differ depending on the nature of the loss (e.g., expected vs. unexpected, traumatic vs. \"natural\"). Grief can be described by five stages:  Not everyone experiences all these stages. Most people don't experience them in a specific order, rather go back and forth between stages. People who are grieving may shift between crying spells, anger, questioning, and numbness within a day or within a few minutes.   ## Facing and moving forward  It is important to pay attention to what you need as you emerge from such a significant experience.  Take a break. Your body and mind need time away from the event to heal. Limit the amount of time that you watch details about the tragedy on TV.  Avoid excessive substance use. Drugs or alcohol may dull the pain in the moment, but they ultimately make post-trauma symptoms worse. Caffeine is an initial stimulant that may contribute to anxiety and set you up for a bigger let down.  Eat and rest. Even though you may not feel like it, you need rest and energy to face the days ahead. Avoid excessive sweets and drink plenty of water.  Connect with people. Talking to people and being around others helps you to reconnect to the world. Seek out persons who care for and support you. Share your reactions, thoughts and how the experience impacted you, or talk about other things—just find ways to connect.  Exercise. To help your body expend some of the nervous energy. Don't overdo it. You may be more tired than you realize.  Establish a routine. Research indicates keeping focused on day-to-day tasks or routines helps mitigate the effects of stress. Structure will help you maintain focus and a sense of purpose and provide a needed mental break from the event.  Give yourself permission to think and feel. Acknowledging and expressing your own unique thoughts and feelings are essential elements of coping and healing. If you aren't comfortable talking with others, consider using art, such as drawings or poetry, or writing a journal.  Practice and implement relaxation techniques. This will reduce the physical symptoms of anxiety. Examples include deep breathing, muscle relaxations, visualization, and meditation.  Engage in helping others. Consider sending donations, cards, or other types of support to relief efforts or those most directly impacted by the event. Helping others often is the healthiest way to manage our own feelings of powerlessness.  Reach out. Talk to a peer support person, mental health professional, or religious/spiritual leader. Other aids may include meditation, reading, spiritual reflection, or involvement in support groups.  Find your new normal. Begin to engage in daily activities. You won't forget what you experienced—it’s now a part of your life. It’s important to recall what your life was like before the event and determine where you want to be in the future. All of this together will help you to find your new normal.   ### Need more information or support?

    "body": "  ## Benchmarking  Through benchmarking, we are able to compare key metrics collected through various assessment modes to the same key metrics tracked at our peer institutions. Benchmarking helps us to improve the quality of our services, aid us in decision-making, develop strategic plans, formulate policies, and justify services within the Division of Student Affairs.  Our staff partners with the following organizations to collect information on students’ experiences ranging from college health, substance use, student engagement, and college union experiences.   ### National College Health Assessment  The American College Health Association-National College Health Assessment (ACHA-NCHA) is a nationally recognized research survey that can assist you in collecting precise data about your students’ health habits, behaviors, and perceptions. Results are used to determine areas of need, with a focus on student health, safety, and support.  [American College Health Association-National College Health Assessment (ACHA-NCHA)](https://www.acha.org/NCHA/Home/NCHA/NCHA_Home.aspx?hkey=f8184410-19fa-4ba6-b791-43a79cef2de0)  [Results](https://irds.iupui.edu/students/student-surveys/national-college-health-assessment.html)   ### Indiana College Substance Use Survey  The Indiana College Substance Use Survey has been serving Indiana institutions of higher education since 2009. Funded by the Indiana Division of Mental Health and Addiction, the survey collects data on the prevalence of substance use and other risk behaviors among Indiana college students. Results are used to determine program effectiveness in alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs prevention, and reported in the Biennial Review Report for federal compliance (EDGAR Part 86).  [Indiana College Substance Use Survey](http://www.indianacollegiateactionnetwork.com/annual-survey.html)  [Results](https://irds.iupui.edu/students/student-surveys/indiana-college-substance-use-survey.html)   ### National Survey on Student Engagement  The National Survey on Student Engagement (NSSE) is a large survey designed to collect nationally representative data about the extent to which students are participating in educationally purposeful activities, both inside and outside the classroom. IUPUI participates in the NSSE every three years along with every campus in the Indiana University system.  [The National Survey on Student Engagement (NSSE)](https://irds.iupui.edu/students/student-surveys/nsse/index.html)   ### Association of College Unions International (ACUI)/Benchworks College Union Assessment.  Student unions occupy a unique position on college campuses -- we call ours the IUPUI Campus Center. They are often designed to be a central hub for campus activities, services, and student life in general. While they aim to maintain a campus-wide sense of community, they must also meet the needs of a diverse array of students. As students change, college unions must strive to keep pace with evolving tastes and needs. As such, data highlighting not only how and why students are using college unions, but also the perceptions of their experience are vital to improving college unions. The Association of College Unions International (ACUI)/Benchworks College Union/Student Center Assessment collects feedback from more than 16,000 students from 35 colleges and universities in the United States. This research explores the college union experience, including information about who uses college union facilities and for what, satisfaction with various aspects of college unions, and concepts that relate to overall measures of college union effectiveness.  Campus Center and Student Experiences implements the ACUI/Benchworks assessment every other year. Benchworks assessments provide insight into satisfaction across the student experience from orientation to graduation.  [ACUI/Benchworks](http://www.skyfactor.com/research-article/college-union-experience/)   ### Association of College and University Housing Officers – International (ACUHO-I)  ACUHO-I strives to be an advocate for the campus housing profession and the individuals who work in it. Through several avenues, the association informs members of the issues that they need to understand and respond to.   ### National Parent and Family Program Survey  The purpose of the Survey of College & University Parent/Family Programs is to collect information on changes and developments in services over time. In 2003, the University of Minnesota Parent Program conducted its first survey of parent and family programs to understand and track the development of parent and family relations in higher education. Parent and family programs were a relatively new focus in higher education at the time, with most services having been introduced within the previous decade and growing interest in the topic demonstrated by numerous program sessions at the National Association of Student Personnel Administrators, American College Personnel Association, and National Orientation Directors Association conferences. The survey is now a combined effort of the Rochester Institute of Technology’s Parent and Family Programs and AHEPPP: Family Engagement in Higher Education -- the professional organization formed in 2008 for higher education professionals who work with parents.

    "body": "  # Transfer student finds opportunity at IUPUI  By: Grace Wothke  Wednesday, November 08, 2023  Transferring colleges can be one of the most difficult decisions a student makes. Not only are you switching schools, but you are moving away, leaving your friends behind and starting somewhere completely different than where you came from.  I decided to ultimately transfer to IUPUI because it was a more cost effective option in terms of what you are truly getting out of being on campus (amenities, education, etc.). I also wanted to move to an area that had opportunities for me to broaden my professional experience in a more diverse way. Being at IUPUI  has allowed me to blossom into a more mature adult, ready to take on bigger challenges.  I applied to several universities before finally choosing to transfer to IUPUI. If I am being honest, the decision wasn’t that difficult when looking over my “pros and cons” list. IUPUI, though connected to all the Indiana University campuses, stood out to me simply because of its ability to have a unique identity amidst a bustling city.  IUPUI was able to offer a location flourishing with opportunity for growth, more detailed and specific majors and minors and a chance to truly put your education into your own hands. IUPUI was also the first university to send me my acceptance letter, which guided my decision.  When looking at new universities, there were three specific qualities that I was looking for. IUPUI hit everything on my list and more.     ## Internship opportunities  Applying for internships was something I was extremely excited to do as a student on an urban campus. IUPUI is located in the heart of Indianapolis, which offers the right set of circumstances for potential internships and opportunities to grow my professional skills.  The internships are limitless both on and off campus — I even applied to one. I am now an intern for the Division of Student Affairs and have learned so much about branding, graphics and writing — which has allowed me to gain real-world experience in the content writing field.   ## Diversity  Another thing I noticed when researching IUPUI was the amount of diversity throughout the campus. Diversity was one of the biggest factors that went into making my decision, as I came from a college that had ways to celebrate diversity, but was not as diverse as I had hoped.  Diversity is so important to me because I think it’s vital in human development and maturity to truly want to learn and understand other cultures, as well as befriending the individuals within it. I believe this allows for a broader perspective and a heart that is grown towards advocacy.  IUPUI has allowed me to fully submerge myself in an environment that celebrates the diversity of its student body. One of my favorite experiences of my first semester was walking into the Campus Center during the International Festival and seeing many different individuals celebrating not only themselves, but everyone on campus.   ## Academics  Once I became a student at IUPUI, I realized how much knowledge I was gaining on a weekly basis. The professors I’ve been taught by have given me skills to prosper in my future career field and stand out amongst a group of colleagues.  I’ve made professional connections through my public relations professor, Denise Herd — a still practicing public relations professional — who brought guest speakers into our class. She also prides herself on being our biggest advocate in terms of progressing our education and career within the field and having access to the tools, knowledge and resources we need to be successful.  Not only did I transfer schools, but I also changed my major when I started at IUPUI. It was heart-wrenching to hear that only a certain number of classes were accepted as valid credits, but I truly think that taking more classes from IUPUI professors will ultimately help shape me as the professional I one day hope to be.  Choosing to be a Jag was one of the best decisions thus far, and I hope other students interested in transferring here see all that IUPUI has to offer — even if your timeline doesn't match with your peers.

Lambda Eta Chapter accepts membership from IUPUI, Butler University, Marian University, University of Indianapolis, and Martin University. Lambda Eta Chapter was the North Central Province Chapter of the Year in 1994, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2004, and 2008.  [Kappa Alpha Psi](https://iupuinphc.weebly.com/kappa-alpha-psi-fraternity-inc---lambda-eta-chapter.html)  The Chi City-wide chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc. was chartered on March 14, 1925 by six captivating women. Our chapter is comprised of over-achieving women from IUPUI, the University of Indianapolis, Marian University, and Butler University. We are the oldest Delta chapter in the state of Indiana, and the history of our chapter is as captivating as our sisterhood.  [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc.](https://iupuinphc.weebly.com/delta-sigma-theta-sorority-inc---chi-city-wide-chapter.html)  The brothers of Phi Beta Sigma are the fraternity’s most valuable resource and strength. They are the primary means by which the Phi Beta Sigma objectives will be achieved. In order to accomplish the fraternity’s objectives, it is essential that systems are instituted that effectively embody “Culture For Service and Service For Humanity” and promote brotherhood, scholarship, and service.  [Phi Beta Sigma](https://iupuinphc.weebly.com/phi-beta-sigma-fraternity-inc---alpha-epsilon-alpha-chapter.html)  Zeta Phi Beta Sorority was organized at Howard University on January 16, 1920 as the result of encouragement given to our five founders (Arizona Cleaver, Pearl Neal, Myrtle Tyler, Viola Tyler, and Fannie Pettie) by Charles Taylor and Langston Taylor, members of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc. Since Zeta Phi Beta’s inception, chapters have continued to be chartered across the U.S. and the world. As a result of the continued chartering of chapters, the city-wide Omicron Pi chapter was founded in Indianapolis, Ind. on April 25, 1998 by six illustrious and determined women: Latisha Kates, Karrie Woodard, Jasmine Shoemaker, Terry Preacher Ransom, Alana Washington, and Jamie Wirewick. Omicron Pi is a part of the Greater Great Lakes region of Zeta Phi Beta. Our chapter here continues to promote the ideals of Zeta Phi Beta through cultural, educational, and civic programs within the community.  [Zeta Phi Beta Sorority](https://iupuinphc.weebly.com/zeta-phi-beta-sorority-inc---omicron-pi-chapter.html)  The GlamaRHOus Gamma Zeta Chapter was chartered on April 6, 1963 by four women who brought Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority, Inc. to undergraduates in the greater Indianapolis area. The Gamma Zeta Chapter is a city-wide chapter that includes students from IUPUI, University of Indianapolis, Marian University, and Martin University. This chapter has continually upheld the image of Sigma Gamma Rho through raising awareness, strengthening our communities through service, and hosting national programs to achieve Greater Service, Greater Progress in the greater Indianapolis community in the areas of education, health awareness, and leadership development.  [Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority, Inc.](https://iupuinphc.weebly.com/sigma-gamma-rho-sorority-inc---gamma-zeta-chapter.html)  \"I joined Sigma Alpha Epsilon because I wanted more from my college experience than just my education. By joining SAE, I was able to develop and grow my social skills through interacting in the Greek-letter community, as well as my professional skills through the positions I took in my chapter.\"  -Collin Henn (SAE)  \"My favorite chapter memory was establishing Alpha Upsilon at IUPUI as the founding line. We got so much support from the Hermanas and created an amazing memory by presenting at our probate on campus as the Alpha Line.\"  -Yoriana Gallegos (SLU)    \"My favorite chapter memory is first joining ZTA and how much love I instantly felt from all of the women!\"  -Ashley Elkin (ZTA)    \"When I leave IUPUI, a lesson I will carry with me is that every struggle was put in my life to teach me a valuable lesson.\"  -Khrisma McMurray (SGRho) "

Campus Health, or the company performing your lab tests and diagnostic imaging, can bill your insurance if you're in network. That means you’ll need to bring your insurance card to your appointment. If you'd like to know what services are covered, you must call your insurance company prior to your appointment.  We are in network for the following insurance plans:  When using your insurance, you are responsible for your co-pay and any remaining balance after your insurer has paid the claim.  If your insurance is out of network or if you are not insured, you will be responsible for the total cost of your visit. These charges are due at the time of your visit, or they can be billed to your bursar account. Campus Health accepts credit cards, checks, and CrimsonCard as payment.   ### Insurance and payment questions?  If you have questions about using your insurance with Campus Health, give us a call at 317-278-1640 or email us at healthfi@iu.edu .

    "url": "URL: https://studentaffairs.iupui.edu/campus-center/reservations/faq.html#search",
    "body": "  ## How early before my event can I submit my reservation request?   ## What are the maximum capacities of each space?  If you are interested in knowing more about max capacities of our meeting room spaces, please contact an Event Services Assistant at 317-278-8511 or email us at campcntr@iupui.edu .   ## How long will it take for my event request to be approved?  All requests will be reviewed within three business days from the date they are received.   ## What is fronting?  University departments and registered student organizations shall not use their privileges to access space, resources, or services and “front” for a non-university group or commercial entity in order to avoid fees or receive reduced fees. All instances of “fronting” will result in an adjustment of all related fees to the appropriate rate. The reserving group responsible for “fronting” may be subject to loss of reservation privileges.  Additionally, if a university department assumes responsibility for an event typically organized by a student organization, that student organization must be registered and in good standing with the CUBE Student Organization Center and Campus Center Event Services. Responsibility may NOT be changed to the student organization after securing space to avoid reservation and facility charges. Likewise, a university department assuming full planning responsibility for an event should not use a registered student organization to secure space in an effort to avoid reservation and facility charges.   ## What should I expect when I show up to the Campus Center at the start of my event?  Start by checking in with the Information Desk, and they will radio the Campus Center Building Manager to inform them of your arrival. They will ensure that your room is unlocked and wait for you to discuss any technology needs.   ## What is parking like for big events?  An IUPUI parking permit is required for all IUPUI parking lots and garages, with the exception of Vermont Garage, which is available to visitors for an hourly rate and metered spots along University Blvd. Please refer to the permit map and/or visitor map for details. Arrangements for parking can be made for events and meetings by contacting IUPUI Parking and Transportation Services at 317-274-4232 or permits@iupui.edu . For student organizations, IUPUI Parking and Transportation Services is a partner with the Event Activity Registration Process and details can be arranged on The Spot.  [permit map](https://parking.iupui.edu/doc/maps/permit_map_main.pdf)  [visitor map](https://parking.iupui.edu/parking/visitors/index.html)   ## What are the different types of setups I can choose from?  The Campus Center offers many different setups to accommodate any event type or idea that you may have. Please review the list of setups that we offer below:  If you are interested in seeing examples of how these setups look in our meeting rooms, please contact an Event Services Assistant and they will send you diagrams of each setup option.  The Event Services team will also work with you if one of our predetermined setups do not meet your event need. We are able to make a diagram for your specific event and send it to you for your approval.   ## When will I know my event is confirmed?  The Campus Center Event Services Assistants will reach out to you after you have submitted the request for your event.  For student organizations, the first confirmation you will receive is a TENTATIVE confirmation. This means that our team has found space during the time you requested, and the rest of your event falls within our predetermined guidelines. Once the event is approved on The Spot by The CUBE team, the Event Services Assistants will send you an official confirmation. This will include the name, date, time, and other critical information of your event. We will also include your reservation number and resources that will be provided to you.  Departments will receive a confirmation email once it is decided by an Event Services Assistant that the event is in an appropriate time and room. If we find that your requested time does not fit in with our event schedule, we will reach out to you and discuss adjusting the time and/or location of the event to accommodate your needs. Departments will receive confirmation from the Campus Center once that is coordinated.  It is not uncommon for the Event Services Assistants to email the organization or department with questions before we send the official confirmation. Please be on the lookout for emails from our team once you have submitted an event so we can process your request in a timely manner.   ## What if I am planning on having food at my event?  For all food service needs, Chartwells (IUPUI Food Services) is the contracted, exclusive food service provider, which includes all retail, catering, and concession sales on the IUPUI campus. For exceptions, please contact Chartwells directly.   ## How can I check for availability for rooms?  The Campus Center Event Services team is more than happy to check availability for all departments, student organizations, and external guests. Our desk is open Monday-Friday, 8 a.m.-5 p.m. You can call us at 317-278-8511 or email us at campcntr@iupui.edu .   ## What are the internet and phone connections like?  All spaces within the Campus Center are Wi-Fi enabled, and any member of the IU system can access the internet by connecting with their staff, faculty, or student credentials through IU Secure.  Guests in the Campus Center can access no-fee Wi-Fi through the “IU Guest” network. Guests will need to accept the terms of use listed on the log in page and then click “Register.”  Depending on the service carrier, there are areas of the Campus Center facility where cellular signals are weak. The only public telephone in the facility is located on the Lower Level and can only be used to make local, Indianapolis calls.   ## Is there a lost and found at the Campus Center?  Campus Center Event Services is not responsible for any lost, stolen, or damaged property belonging to guests of the facility. Every effort will be made to return lost/misplaced items whenever possible. The Campus Center Lost and Found is located at the Information Desk on Level 1. Items deemed to be of high value (credit/debit cards, driver’s licenses, cell phones, etc.) will be turned over to Indiana University Police Department (IUPD) at the end of each business day. Other items will be held until the end of the month in which they were turned in before being discarded and/or donated. It is the responsibility of the reserving group to ensure all items are removed from the space following a reservation. Any items left by a reserving entity will be kept a maximum of seven business days, after which time they will be discarded or donated.   ## Is security provided by the Campus Center for large events that need it?  IUPD is responsible for public safety while event and meeting guests are on university property. Additional security may be required for certain events, a determination that will be made by IUPD. If an activity is determined to need IUPD and/or ESG presence, the event hosts will be responsible for all associated costs. Additionally, once it is determined that the presence of IUPD is necessary for an event, IUPD then reserves the right to cancel or postpone an event if they are unable to provide the staff necessary or do not approve the nature of the event.  In general, if IUPD presence is required, for every 50 attendees present at an event, there must be one officer.   ## How do I reserve an information table?  Limited space is available for information tables inside the Campus Center for both internal and external entities to promote themselves, their activities, and/or their products. An information table will consist of one table and two chairs. The table will be covered with an IUPUI tablecloth unless otherwise requested. Organizations are prohibited from supplying their own tables and/or booths. Only one table may be reserved per organization per day, not to exceed three days in a given week. Additional tables may be requested but require special permission from the Campus Center Event Services team. Please be prepared to provide, in writing, rationale for requesting multiple information tables. Information tables can only be reserved as long as they are not offering products or services already found in the Campus Center or provided by IUPUI.   ## Can I bring decorations to my event?  To prevent as much associated damage as possible, the Campus Center Event Services staff has restricted the types of decorations that may be used within the facility. If found in violation of any of these restrictions, meeting and event organizers may be assessed a $150 cleaning/damage fee payable at the time of invoice. Please see the Campus Center Event Policy Manual included in your reservation  confirmation for a list of what is not accepted in the Campus Center.   ### Start planning your event today "

This student group, which provides voter registration information and education to the student body, has led IUPUI to its first-ever recognition on ALL IN’s* 2022 list of Most Engaged Campuses for College Student Voting. This title was only awarded to 394 other colleges and universities nationwide.  [JagsVote’s](https://thespot.iupui.edu/organization/jagslead)  [ALL IN’s* 2022 list of Most Engaged Campuses for College Student Voting.](https://allinchallenge.org/most-engaged-campuses/)  IUPUI has been part of ALL IN since 2016 and received two silver campus awards in the past. However, the university’s student civic engagement assistants wanted to do more for the 2022 election cycle.  For the first time, a highly established action plan was created to showcase how IUPUI would actively increase young voter engagement and participation. This action plan was a core requirement to qualify for ALL IN’s list.  \"It was really an achievement because we spent all summer on the action plan and our goals. To see that all of our hard work was noticed was really nice for my entire team,\" said Emily Veensta, student area manager for civic engagement assistants.  \"I’m proud of what we’re doing and can see the change that’s being made on campus through our efforts,\" she said. \"Getting to share this information with students gets me excited because they can make a difference. Whether it’s on a federal or school-district level, sharing our voices is really important to how things are run here in Indiana.\"  Assistant Vice Chancellor of the Office of Community Engagement Jennifer Boehm also echoes the impact of what a student’s vote can do for their community.  \"There are so many things in a student’s life that are affected by who has been elected into office, even at the local level,\" said Boehm. \"We want to make sure our students have the confidence while they’re in college of understanding the voting process and how to be an educated voter.\"  To get the campus community excited and involved in the 2022 midterm elections…  Being recognized nationally only reinforces that IUPUI’s efforts are positively impacting young voters. During the 2020 election cycle, IUPUI saw a 68.1% voting rate, which is higher than most other universities. But IUPUI encourages students to go beyond their votes too.  \"We’re always looking to grow our number of registered voters, but it’s also important for students to know how to be active citizens. I’d encourage students to get to know who their elected officials are by following them on social media to see where they stand on different issues,\" said Boehm.

    "body": "  # Multimedia Production Center: A place for printing, graphic design, and falling in love.  By: Lexa Muehlbauer  Tuesday, February 14, 2023  Forget \"The Bachelor\" or \"Love is Blind.\" Finding your soulmate may be easier than you think. IUPUI alumni and college sweethearts Karl and Clinton and Tara and Jacob all met on campus and grew their relationships while designing marketing materials and printing posters at the Multimedia Production Center.  Both couples continue to be close friends with one another ­ — Tara and Jacob will be attending Karl and Clinton’s wedding next month! — and look back fondly on their time at IUPUI.   ### Karl and Clinton ('18)  Question: How did the two of you meet?  Karl: Clinton and I met in the spring semester of 2015 and were in the Human Computer Interaction class together. We were both assigned to the same group project. I liked him, but I didn’t know he was queer. Funny thing is, Clinton knew that I was because he had sent me a message on OkCupid several months earlier (which I hadn’t noticed).  When Valentine’s Day was rolling around that semester, I finally saw his message and realized I knew him from class. This time, I reached out to Clinton on Facebook and poked fun about our almost-missed connection. We had our first date on Feb. 13.  Q: What were your first impressions of each other?  Karl: I thought Clinton was a lot more social than I was because he took control of the group project in a good way and always had a smile on his face. He was nice, he was kind and obviously very handsome. He was a charismatic person.  Clinton: The first thing I noticed about Karl was their intelligence. They were always easy to talk to. Sometimes you just vibe with the right people and it’s easy.  Q: What were your experiences like working in the MPC together?  Karl: When I met Clinton, he was already working at the MPC and I was in between jobs, so I applied to work there too. I mostly handled the print work. Working at the MPC is the most fun I’ve ever had at a job. I loved my time there and everyone we got to work with over our almost three years in the position.  Clinton: One of my favorite college jobs was working as a junior graphic designer at the MPC. Nate is the best boss ever and we met several other friends who we’re still in contact with.  Q: What were your favorite memories together in college?  Karl and Clinton: Clinton and I were the co-chairs for the Gamers Hall student organization. To recruit new members, we had a VR headset so students could try out games. We were really ahead of our time with that, and it made us the coolest student org tabling for sure. Every Friday night we also hosted a game night, which was a lot of fun.  Q: What does life look like for you both now after college?  Karl and Clinton: We graduated in the spring of 2018 and then moved to Cincinnati for Clinton’s job as a software engineer. Our move back to Indy happened right when the pandemic started. In March of 2022, we bought our first house together in Broad Ripple, which is actually close to where we lived together right before graduation.  Our wedding is set for March 11 of this year, and then directly after, we’re flying to Japan for our honeymoon. It’ll be the first time we’re travelling internationally together. We’ll be enjoying the cherry blossom season and visiting Tokyo, Kyoto, Hiroshima and Miyajima, which is a special place for Karl.  Karl: I went to Miyajima in high school and it’s still one of the most beautiful days of my life. I need to go back there and share that with my husband.   ### Tara and Jacob ('15)  Q: How did the two of you meet?  Tara and Jacob: We met in 2013 through our major, Computer Graphics Technology. We had most of our classes together and started out as friends.  Q: What were your first impressions of each other?  Tara: I thought that he was very sweet and had a similar sense of humor to me.  Jacob: My first impression of Tara was that I really wanted to talk to her, but would probably never get to because she was in a different friend group.  Q: What were your experiences like working in the MPC together?  Tara: I loved it! Most of our shared time at the MPC, we were just friends still. So, it was really fun getting to come to work with someone I was so close to and got along with so well.  I also knew Jacob had a different design style than I did, so I was able to use his skills on some of my MPC projects when I got stuck. It was really helpful!  Jacob: Working at the MPC was always fun, and rarely felt like work. Being able to work with Tara felt like an extension of our class time together, and it served as a bridge to us starting to hang out outside of class.  Q: What were your favorite memories together in college?  Tara: I would say working at the MPC might even be my fondest memory. I learned so much about design, had a great boss (Nate!), and to this day, Jacob and I remain close with most of our other coworkers from our time there.  Jacob: Since we worked in the Campus Center, Tara and I would get coffee together at either Starbucks or Caribou almost every day. That time definitely added up and is probably responsible for us eventually falling in love.  Q: What does life look like for you both now after college?  Tara and Jacob: We bought a house together at the end of 2018 near Irvington and live there with our cats! After over seven years together, we got married in October 2022. "

    "body": "  # Student voices needed to improve health and wellness services  By: Corin Chapman  Monday, January 30, 2023  Student health is more important than ever. For the first time, the National College Health Assessment (NCHA) — an online survey — will be sent to all IUPUI students to help address the health and wellness needs of IUPUI’s student body.  All students who participate in the survey will have the chance to win 1 of 10 $100 Amazon gift cards. Eric Teske, director of Health and Wellness Promotion, talks about the importance of the health survey and why students should take part.  Question: How can students fill out the survey?  Answer: The survey will be sent to all IUPUI students by email on Monday, Feb. 13 and will remain open until Sunday, March 5.  Q: Why is the health survey so important?  A: The survey results are used to determine funding priorities for health and wellness programs on campus. Based on what we find out, we will shift funds to address areas of student health and well-being that are trending in the wrong direction.  Since the survey only happens every three years, it is really important that we get as many students to respond as possible, so that we can accurately identify areas of concern. The survey is completely voluntary, but we hope thousands of students respond so that we get the best information possible.  Q: What types of questions will the survey ask?  A: The questions cover a variety of topics, from physical to mental health, illegal substance abuse, sexual behavior and interpersonal violence. Since many of these questions are very personal, privacy is of the utmost importance.  The survey never asks students for identifying information and IUPUI has no way to match any survey answers with any particular students.  Q: What has the survey been able to do in past years?  A: The last time we did the survey , we saw alarming numbers of students who met the criteria for low food security. This finding helped to increase financial support for Paws’ Pantry.  [last time we did the survey](https://studentaffairs.iupui.edu/news/stories/2020-10-27-ncha-iupui-recovery-campus.html)  In 2020, we also learned that IUPUI was lagging behind the national average for condom use, so we started sending free condoms to students by mail to increase distribution. Now our Safer Sex Supplies program has tripled in capacity and distributes 17,000 products a year. This is a perfect example of identifying a need using survey data and doing something about it to benefit the students we serve.  [Safer Sex Supplies program](https://studentaffairs.iupui.edu/health/wellness-programs/resources/safer-sex-supplies.html)  Students who have questions about the survey can contact Eric Teske at erictesk@iupui.edu .

    "body": "  # Newly established Prevention Peer Education Program aims to create culture change  By: Lexa Muehlbauer  Thursday, June 29, 2023  Changing the culture.  This is the main goal of prevention work being done on campus. It can be a tall order when trying to connect with students on nuanced topics like bystander intervention and consent. Assistant Director of Interpersonal Violence Prevention and Advocacy Viviane Linos saw the need for a student-led program and began the work to form a peer education group just months after joining the Counseling and Psychological Services team.   #### PPEP's foundation  Throughout her interpersonal violence prevention career, Linos has seen the many benefits of a peer education group. \"I feel it's the best way to meet students where they're at and actually work towards changing the culture,\" said Linos.  Aside from seeing the benefits in real time, peer education is also a national best practice and continues to be a successful strategy in the Student Affairs community nationwide.  Linos started setting the groundwork for a PPEP group in fall of 2022. Through an ICAN mini-grant, Linos built the program and recruited six students to be the first members of its cohort. In November, these students went through a seven-week training before they engaged with other Jaguars on prevention education topics.   #### How PPEP is positively impacting our campus community  The mission of this peer education group is to:  In order to achieve this throughout the spring semester, PPEP members reached 540 students by facilitating events like the Clothesline Project, planning programs for Sexual Assault Awareness Month and collaborating with student organizations. Just in April, Black Student Union and PPEP partnered to create a space for open discussion about sexual violence in the Black community.  Student Affairs also recognized PPEP’s hard work by awarding Linos, her team and the students with Best Initiative/Service at the division’s end-of-year awards ceremony .  [the division’s end-of-year awards ceremony](https://studentaffairs.iupui.edu/news/stories/2023-06-23-dosas-awards.html)   #### The future of PPEP  With such a strong foundation in place, Linos is excited to see how PPEP continues to grow. For the fall, PPEP will see an increase in its number of cohorts, with four returning members and six new members.  Due to increased interest in mental health topics and access to mental health experts within CAPS, PPEP will expand to include mental health prevention and stigma reduction efforts into the overall culture change mission. The group is excited to grow its advisor team by welcoming Brittany Snyder, assistant director of mental health outreach, and Maddie Folta, prevention education specialist.  \"We invite students who don't have a lot of knowledge around these topics, but have a passion and want to learn more. And we're utilizing this program to not just educate and engage with our community, but to also develop the students who are in the program in a leadership capacity,\" said Linos.  \"They can take this experience with them outside of IUPUI and continue to impact our community in positive ways.\"   #### Hear what inspired students to join PPEP  \" After personally experiencing violence in an interpersonal relationship and then receiving support from CAPS, I loved the opportunity to educate my peers on the resources available to them.\"  \"'I want to make the world a better place' is a cookie cutter answer, but it's true. And the root of it is I never know where to put my foot in the door. PPEP is the perfect opportunity to get access to resources and connections that I can help my community with. As one person, I can only do so much, but as a team, we can all do so much more.\"  \"I want to help my peers know more about themselves. Too many students sit silently facing discrimination and oppression and if I can help even one person become educated on these issues, then I'd feel like I helped to make a change.\" "

    "body": "  # Part-time jobs positively impact 3 students' journeys  By: Mary Olk Knarr  Thursday, June 01, 2023  The Campus Center operates efficiently because of the efforts of students. While there is a team of full-time staff dedicated to the management and operations of the building, dozens of student employees are doing everything from event management, operating the Game Room and welcoming visitors at the Information Desk.  As this academic year wrapped up, a few student employees reflected on their experiences, the skills they learned in their roles and how their experience influences them to stay at IUPUI.   #### Theint Nwe Nyein, sophomore, computer science Information Desk team member  Question: How did your work experience help prepare you for what’s next?  Answer: As I reflect on my experience, I noticed that working as a Campus Center team member helped me a lot with planning skills, for both the short-term and long-term, and in identifying my goals for the future. I gained more confidence in my communication skills, such as advocating for my needs and providing clear, transparent information to others. As a result, I became officers in two different clubs, and I participated in a multicultural student leader retreat. I also learned how to better prioritize.  Q: How did your work experience influence you to stay at IUPUI?  A: Working at the Campus Center makes me feel like I always have up-to-date news about IUPUI, which makes me feel great.

A: My experience as a Campus Center student employee helped prepare me for what’s next in a variety of ways. I had to learn how to manage my time effectively and stay organized in order to meet deadlines and complete all of my tasks. I also learned how to provide excellence customer service to students, staff and faculty, which is a valuable and important skill to learn for any career.  Q: How did your work experience influence you to stay at IUPUI?  A: I learned a lot and met a lot of great people, and my experience working at the Campus Center influenced me to stay because it helped me develop a strong network of contacts on campus. It also helped me learn more about the university and the resources available. Finally, it helped me feel more connected to the IUPUI community. I feel like I am a part of something bigger than myself, and that I’m making a difference.   #### Kate Dunn, senior, social work Building manager  Q: How did your work experience help prepare you for what’s next?  A: Working at the Campus Center has improved my overall well-being because I have met many new friends. This job has improved my communication and time management skills, both of which I will need to use in my future career as a social worker.  Q: How did your work experience influence you to stay at IUPUI?  A: I really enjoy the work culture here — everyone tends to be very kind and excited to work. Even though there are different teams, everyone gets along very well and the atmosphere is very inviting.

When you need a caring, knowledgeable, and supportive champion, we are in your corner.  When you’re having an academic problem, we can help you navigate university policies and find the appropriate support services. We’ve included some information below, and if you need additional support, make an appointment with us.   ### Contact us  317-274-4431 Campus Center 350 To have an advocate reach out to you, visit go.iupui.edu/refer2osas.

Communicate directly with your professors if you are unable to attend classes. Depending on the policies for a particular course or department, they may request documentation such as a doctor’s note.  We do not provide oversight for academic units or faculty. However, in an emergency situation such as hospitalization, we can contact your instructors if you will miss class for three or more days or are unable to inform them directly. We recommend talking with your instructors as soon as possible to discuss accommodations and make-up procedures for your courses. A withdrawal from classes may be necessary for extended absences.   #### Dropping classes  There are several deadlines each term for dropping classes. If you can no longer drop a class on your own through One.IU —this deadline is usually the first week of the term—you must meet with your academic advisor. More information about dropping classes can be found through the Office of the Registrar .  [One.IU](https://one.iu.edu/)  [Registrar](https://studentcentral.iupui.edu/register/index.html)   #### Grade changes and grievances  Before submitting a grade change petition, we recommend speaking with your instructor calmly, directly, and in person. If you believe your course grade is incorrect, you can follow the university’s formal grade grievances procedure. As with all university polies, we are available to help you understand these procedures and navigate the process.  [grade change](https://studentcentral.iupui.edu/grades-progress/grade-changes/index.html)  If you have other concerns about a professor’s conduct or are unable to reach a resolution on other disputes, you may address your concerns to the course coordinator or department chair. You can also request an appointment with us for conflict coaching to discuss your concerns and ways to approach the conversation with your instructor.   #### Withdrawing from classes  When an emergency prevents you from being able to attend courses, you may need to withdraw from classes. Being hospitalized, a death in your immediate family, or being the victim of a crime are just a few examples of what might constitute an emergency. If you aren’t sure if your situation warrants an emergency withdrawal, we can help you figure it out.  You may need documentation to withdraw from a class. Your documentation should provide your contact information, including name, address, and phone and fax numbers, as well as answer the questions below. It should also be signed and dated. We can help you submit this documentation.   ### Emergency financial support  Our student advocacy team can help connect you to on-campus and community resources when you’re in a financial pinch.

We currently have 350 members on The Spot and over 700 members on our Discord ,\" said Gamers Hall President Devin Bailey.  [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/VwwWhvCcFq)  \"Our club spans a lot of different interests that all fall under the same umbrella of gaming, which there's a huge passion and drive for on campus.\"  With COVID-19, many student organizations saw a significant decrease in participation. Whereas Gamers Hall continued to thrive.  \"It's great to see the resilience of the student body and how they continue doing what they love,\" Bailey said. \"Even coming back from the pandemic, the number of gamers at our events were wonderful.\"   ## From consoles to competitions  As the student organization continues to grow, its officers have worked hard to consistently set up events and gaming experiences that cater to members' interests, specifically with esports.*  \"It's a large focus for us,\" Bailey said. \"We want to compete. We want to represent IUPUI.\"  Currently, Gamers Hall has competitive teams for \"League of Legends,\" \"Overwatch 2,\" \"Rocket League,\" \"Smash\" and \"Counter-Strike.\" While it's all fun and games, these students are also serious about flexing their skills state and nationwide.  \"We host various tryout events for our competitive teams, similar to what a club sport would do,\" said Gamers Hall Treasurer Noah Pumphrey. \"Throughout the semester, we'll host casual tournaments in-house and have connected with other universities, like Rutgers University, which has a big esports program.\"  For students interested in the esports industry, Gamers Hall is a great community to connect gamers together and provides them with unique experiences applicable to this growing field.  \"We want to give Jaguars the opportunities to pursue those interests, even if there isn't currently an esports degree program available at IUPUI. Giving them chances to do things like broadcast an event, organize the logistics around a big esports event or code a game that we can use for a 24-hour game jam is important,\" Pumphrey said.   ## Bringing gamers together  As the organization's new president, Bailey has plans to keep up Gamers Hall's presence on campus.  \"For the fall semester, we’re hitting it full stride. We expect to host one event — with 20 to 100 expected attendees — every two weeks and have viewing parties for big competitions that happen,\" said Bailey.  \"Our organization is the place for gamers to socially connect and bring students together, to have a good time. We plan to continue that as Gamers Hall grows.\"  *Esports: Competitive online gaming. These are usually multiplayer video games that encompass a wide range of categories. Examples include car races and Rocket League (3v3 soccer). "

    "body": "  # First-ever NaloxBox installed at IUPUI  By: Mary Olk Knarr  Thursday, June 01, 2023  What are the negative aspects of having Naloxone on hand? There aren't any. Just ask Annika Whitlock.  The IUPUI graduate student recently helped save a life by having Naloxone in her car's center console. She was going to a doctor's appointment downtown and noticed a man sitting on the sidewalk who seemed to be under the influence but who was conscious and moving around.  A few minutes later, she noticed a person on a bicycle had stopped and tapped the man on the shoulder. He didn't respond.  Whitlock noticed the man's face turning a greyish color and his lips turning blue. She grabbed the Naloxone and jumped out of the car. Within a few minutes of the Naloxone being administered, the man's breathing improved, and he was regaining consciousness.  \"It was truly all of the right people in the right place at the right time,\" Whitlock said.  Someone else had stopped to perform CPR, someone called 911 and nurses in the doctor's office had also come outside to help when the ambulance arrived.  \"It was really nice that there just happened to be a bunch of people around who were committed and inspired to helping,\" Whitlock said. \"Everyone was also surprised that I even had the Naloxone on hand. I think this situation helped them realize how important it is to have.\"  Naloxone doesn't take up a lot of space, and if it's administered to someone who doesn't need it, it won't hurt them. If someone does need it, it can save their life.  Naloxone, the drug in Narcan nasal spray, is a medication approved to reverse overdose by opioids (e.g., heroin, fentanyl, Vicodin, OxyContin, morphine), and it blocks the toxic effects of the overdose. Signs of an opioid overdose include unresponsiveness or unconsciousness; slow, shallow or irregular breathing; cold, clammy, pale or bluish skin; fingernails or lips turning blue or purple.  A few days after this occurred, IUPUI was in the process of installing the NaloxBox, a Naloxone opioid rescue kit, on campus. It gives 24/7 access to Narcan nasal spray and is refilled and monitored by Health and Wellness Promotion.  The box is located in the Vermont St. parking garage near the first floor pay station by the Campus Center. It's unlocked, and Narcan nasal spray kits are free to take thanks to a partnership between the Indiana Division of Mental Health and Addiction and Overdose Lifeline, Inc.  [The box is located in the Vermont St. parking garage](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=791#!m/749282?s/)  Whitlock received her bachelor's degree in health sciences from the School of Health and Human Sciences in Dec. 2021, and she's set to finish her master's degree in public health from the Fairbanks School of Public Health in Aug. 2023. She also has worked for Health and Wellness Promotion since Jan. 2022, and looks to continue working in health education and health promotion.  \"I can link a lot of what I've learned back to my part-time job with Health and Wellness Promotion, and my experience has definitely influenced that I want to continue this work,\" Whitlock said.  Questions about the NaloxBox can be sent to hwpindy@iupui.edu . "

We’ve listed a variety of resources below that might be able to help. You can ask your Quit Coach for more information.   ## Nicotine Replacement Therapies (NRT)  NRT is a type of treatment that gives small, steady doses of nicotine to help stop cravings and relieve symptoms that occur when a person is trying to quit using nicotine. These products include nicotine gum, nicotine inhaler, nicotine nasal spray, nicotine lozenges, and nicotine patch, and most are available without a prescription at your local pharmacy.   ## Prescriptions  There are prescription medications that have been shown to help nicotine-users quit, and some can be used along with NRTs to increase success of quitting. Consult with a physician about which prescription and NRT combination would work best for you. We recommend visiting Campus Health on IUPUI's campus.   ## Coaching/counseling  Seeking out individual, group, or phone coaching/counseling has been proven to be effective for helping people quit. Your IUPUI Quit Coach can offer free, non-clinical coaching services. If you’re looking for mental health counseling, consider reaching out to Counseling and Psychological Services at IUPUI .   ## Supporting others quitting  Having the right support is integral to being successful and staying nicotine-free.

    "body": "  ## CAPS payment policies  Payment in full is expected at the time of service. CAPS currently accepts payment by check, credit card, or by billing a student’s university bursar account. CAPS does not bill insurance, but we can provide a receipt to submit for possible reimbursement from your provider.  Students will receive a monthly notification of any unpaid balances for counseling services. These charges will be billed to the individual’s bursar account when 60 days past due. Charges for missed psychiatry (medication management) appointments will be billed to the individual’s bursar account if unpaid after 30 days.  In the event a payment needs to be refunded, the refund must be given in the exact same manner the original payment was received (check, credit card, bursar). It may take two to four weeks for a refund to be processed and received.   ### Policies related to specific fees   #### Initial consultation and referral  Initial consultation sessions are provided at no charge.   #### Service fee  If your recommendation includes individual or group therapy at CAPS, and you choose to initiate either one of those services, a $15 service fee will be assessed. This fee is not subject to sliding-scale reductions.  Clients returning from a break in services of more than four (4) months will also be charged the service fee of $15 in order to re-establish services.   #### Group counseling  Beyond the service fee, there is no charge for group counseling sessions. Group sessions will be 60–90 minutes in length depending on the nature of the group.   #### Individual counseling sessions  Beyond the service fee, a student’s first six (6) individual counseling sessions with CAPS are free. Additional individual sessions beyond the first six (6) are $10 per session. These fees are eligible for a fee reduction.  In cases where the charge for individual counseling is prohibitive, an application for fee reduction may be completed. This application must include verification of income, and the session fee will be determined from a schedule based on the Taxable Income and Number of Dependents reported on the Federal Income Tax Form 1040, FAFSA, or recent pay stub. Documentation for fee adjustments will be submitted to the director for determination.   #### Psychiatric medication management  Psychiatric services are provided at CAPS from a board-certified psychiatrist. Fees for psychiatric services include $55 for an initial intake session and $40 for medication management (follow-up) appointments. These fees are greatly discounted compared to community-based providers due to allotments from the General Services Fee. Fees for psychiatric services are not subject to fee reductions, and payment is due at the time of services.  Due to the high demand and limited availability of psychiatric services at CAPS, students will be charged for missed appointments. Full fees will be charged for missed appointments not cancelled at least 24 hours in advance. Fees not paid within 30 days will be billed to the student’s university bursar account. Multiple missed appointments may result in termination of services. Fees for missed appointments may be appealed in writing with appeals submitted to the director for review and approval or denial.

Earth Day because it's an opportunity to celebrate the outside and go hiking.  Do you have a favorite dish you like to cook?  Almond-crusted lime chicken.

    "body": "  ## Green Dot bystander intervention: Reducing and ending power-based personal violence  Green Dot is a program that empowers all of us to step into the vital role of being a good bystander. Knowing how and when to speak up helps prevent power-based interpersonal violence from occurring on our campus. The Green Dot program is for all students, faculty, and staff at IUPUI, and it is facilitated through training sessions. You’ll build skills for intervening in situations in a way that fits your individual comfort level and skills.  While one person may not be able to change the entire culture of our campus, each of our individual actions will lead to a culture that does not stand for sexual assault, dating violence, or stalking.   ### Why Green Dot?  Green Dot has been used in training 50+ colleges and universities across the U.S., as well as in high schools, the Air Force, and community programs.  In a study of high schools across Kentucky, Green Dot was estimated to have prevented approximately 120 instances of sexual violence in the third year of implementation and 88 instances of sexual violence in the fourth year of implementation. Sexual assault perpetration rates were 21% lower in intervention schools, and sexual assault victimization rates were 13% lower. Similar patterns were observed for dating violence, stalking, and sexual harassment perpetration and victimization.  Green Dot’s focus on individual actions as bystanders empowers participants toward culture change.   ### How to request a Green Dot training  Our team would love to train you on the Green Dot bystander intervention program. Currently, we’re focusing on training faculty and staff, and we will open up trainings to students soon. To request a Green Dot training for your faculty or staff group, please fill out our online form .   ## Definitions and more information  Bystander, Green Dot, intervention—these all might be new concepts for you. We recognize that can be overwhelming, so we’ve compiled some information to introduce you to the Green Dot program.     ## What is a green dot?  A green dot is a single moment in time when someone makes a choice to intervene and prevent a red dot from happening or getting worse. Imagine a green dot appearing on our campus.  As we add more green dots to our campus, we will begin to outnumber and displace the red dots, causing incidents of power-based violence (sexual assaults, dating/domestic violence, and stalking) to decrease.  It is important for us all to develop realistic solutions to intervene, even when it is difficult.   ## What is a red dot?  Imagine that every time an act of power-based personal violence occurs, a red dot appears on our campus. Red dots include incidents of sexual assault, dating/domestic violence, and stalking. Here are some examples of when a red dot might appear:  Over time, these red dots add up and too many people in our community are harmed. This creates a culture that allows unacceptable rates of sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking to occur.  We have a key role in preventing red dots from happening in our community. As bystanders, we play two major roles in addressing power-based violence:   ## Who is a bystander?   ## What are the warning signs of red dots?  As a bystander, you may know the person doing the harm, the person being harmed, or even both. Remember, people of all genders are at risk for power-based personal violence.  As bystanders, the warning signs we notice can be different, and what we notice can change depending on our relationships with the people involved. Below are common warning signs you may notice as a bystander.  For sexual assault:  For dating/domestic violence:  For stalking:   ## What are barriers a bystander could encounter?  Even when we notice warning signs and have the impulse to intervene, sometimes it can be difficult to do something due to our own barriers. We all have barriers that prevent us from intervening sometimes.   ## How many types of green dots are there?   ## What are reactive green dots?  Reactive green dots are what you can do when you see something concerning happening. It can be a reaction to something in progress to either stop the action or prevent more harm from happening. There are three reactive green dot options. You should utilize the one that is most realistic for you.   ## What are proactive green dots?  Proactive green dots are things you can do to stop red dots before they occur. They help set positive norms. To create these norms, we must DO and SAY things to let those around us know our values. Norms are set by small decisions.  Proactive green dots reset our campus norms and make it clear that:  Consider this question: How do I communicate to my friends, co-workers, and peers that power-based personal violence prevention efforts are important to me?  Examples of proactive green dots: "

    "body": "  # Past recipients encourage graduate students to apply for the Elite 50  By: Corin Chapman  Monday, November 07, 2022  Each year, IUPUI honors 50 graduate and professional students with the Elite 50 award. These chosen students have shown excellence both inside and outside the classroom, whether it be through their campus leadership, scholarly work or community engagement.  Students who are ranked amongst the top 10 of the Elite 50 will be given the Premier 10 award, while the top ranked student will be honored with the Dr. Charles R. Bantz Award for Excellence.  All currently enrolled graduate and professional students in good standing with the university are eligible to apply for the Elite 50. Students may also be nominated by peers or faculty. To submit an application , here’s what you need to know:  [To submit an application](https://graduate.iupui.edu/support/elite50/index.html#:~:text=Awards,will%20receive%20the%20Charles%20R.)   ### Important dates  Jan. 9 – nomination deadline  Jan. 16 – application deadline  Jan. 30 – recommendation letter deadline  Winners will be announced in March.   ### Past award winners share their experiences  Kelsey Binion, a 2021 Premier 10 recipient, believes that all graduate students, no matter their chosen discipline, should apply for the Elite 50.  \"Sometimes graduate students may cut themselves short when they are looking at the Elite 50 application requirements,\" Binon said. \"But once you begin to fill out the application, you begin to realize how much you do outside of class.\"  Sara Hindi (Elite 50 '22) talked about how much it meant to her to be recognized among a competitive pool of applicants.  \"When I received the Elite 50 award, I was overwhelmed with joy and gratitude. There are a lot of graduate and professional students who apply for the award; it is a competitive process,\" she said. \"I was very honored to be selected.\"  Binion shared a similar reaction to being honored for more than just her academic record.  \"When I was honored with a Premier 10 award, I was really excited. I felt like the things I was doing on campus through leadership, teaching and service were recognized,\" she said. \"I don’t think there’s another award given at IUPUI that looks at all the different facets of a student’s educational career.\"   ### Recognizing the efforts of graduate and professional students  While graduate students are often awarded for their academic achievements, they often contribute so much more to IUPUI.  Molly Connor, the recipient of the 2021 Bantz Award, emphasized how important it is to honor the efforts of graduate and professional students.  \"Graduate students work exceptionally hard, and the Elite 50 gives those students the opportunity to lift their heads from academia and be recognized for their contributions to the campus community.\"  Isheka Orr (Elite 50 '22) mentioned that just going through the application process  helped her recognize her growth and involvement with the university.  \"I had the realization that I do more than I thought I did, both for the school and the community. I got the chance to sit down and reflect on my achievements,\" said Orr.  This year’s award recipients will be invited to a special reception in 2023 to honor their accomplishments. This awards banquet provides a chance to connect with students from different academic programs and be recognized by the university for their contributions to our campus as graduate students.

    "body": "  # IUPUI students spend fall break engaged in service  By: Lexa Muehlbauer  Wednesday, November 02, 2022  Learn. Serve. Grow. While many Jaguars visited home, hung out with friends or worked over fall break, a small team of students were volunteering in Detroit as part of IUPUI’s Alternative Break program .  [IUPUI’s Alternative Break program](https://studentaffairs.iupui.edu/get-involved/alternative-break-programs/index.html)   ### What is Alternative Break  This unique opportunity offers students a chance to travel somewhere in the Midwest to create positive, sustainable change. All Alternative Breaks are planned and led by students who are inspired to use this time off school to understand social issues neighboring communities face.  This year, Alternative Break Co-Coordinators Medha Kulkarni and Zhen Hong Tan chose the theme of environmental sustainability and justice and worked with service partners like Greening Detroit, Michigan Urban Farming Initiative, Rippling Hope and Calvary UMC.   ### Making an impact  The trip is an eye-opening experience that educates and challenges students to go outside of their comfort zone.  \"During the trip, I had the opportunity to plant trees and help in urban agriculture for the first time in my life,\" Tan said.  Several trip-goers see changes within themselves throughout the program. \"My first Alternative Break trip in fall 2019 was the best experience I’ve ever had and went on to shape my college career and what I’m involved with on campus,\" said Kulkarni, who is also a Social Justice Scholar.  \"Our work has a massive influence not only on the people we work for, but on ourselves. Connecting with your peers via something as unique as service and adventure is fantastic,\" she said.   ### New friends and fun memories  Serving alongside other students who are also interested in social change quickly turns strangers into friends – making Alternative Break programs a great way to meet new people.  \"I started at IUPUI in January of 2021 when the COVID-19 pandemic was at its worst, so I didn’t have many chances to meet new people who have the same interests and passions as I do,\" Tan said.  \"Alternative Breaks provided me with the opportunity to do so. This year’s participants had really high energy levels. We had a great time chatting or playing games each night and got to know each other well.\"  Kulkarni also came away from this year’s trip with lasting memories. \"I made friends with an incredible cohort. We all bonded on the car ride to Detroit, cooked Indian food together and were excited to see the U.S.-Canadian border.\"   ### Creating change on campus  What was learned on Alternative Break didn’t just stay in Detroit. Students returned to campus with new insights and applied lessons and experiences from the trip to their everyday lives.  \"Being an RA for the Women in Science House, I am taking the initiative to reduce paper by finding different ways to effectively distribute event information,\" Kulkarni said.  \"This trip reinforced my perspectives on countering environmental racism and speaking up when I feel like something is wrong.\"  Students can apply to be part of an Alternative Break trip each fall and spring semester. Follow @jagbreak on Instagram for trip recaps and details on when applications will open for future trips.

Amongst hundreds of applications, five of the 33 college-aged women chosen for this year’s 500 Festival Princess Program are representing IUPUI.  As program ambassadors, the selected princesses go through a 500 Festival Leadership Development Program, receive a $1,000 scholarship, perform outreaches with community organizations and participate in events leading up to race day.   ### Meet our IUPUI 500 Festival Princesses  Faith Zindozin Odiete Criminal Justice  Question: Describe your experience in the program. Answer: \"Since the program began in 1959, I’m the first Nigerian to be a 500 Festival Princess. So that’s really fun to be able to put my community on the map and let other girls know they can do it. Initially I was a little skeptical about it, thinking ' this is not made for people that look like me, with my skin color, or where I come from.' But it has been an absolutely amazing experience because I can give back to my community and be a part of that leadership progress. I love it.\"  Q: What kind of outreach have you done in the community? A: \"Most of my outreaches are with young girls. I go into schools and talk to them about my personal story and how I became a princess, and how they can get into the program one day too. During my first outreach, two girls came up to me and wouldn’t let me go because they haven’t seen someone that’s looked like them with a sash and a crown come to their school before. And that really stuck with me.\"  Jenna Nicodemus Public Health, Social Behavioral Sciences  Q: Why did you apply for the 500 Festival Princess Program? A: \"It’s something a few of my friends have gone through, and I’ve heard phenomenal things about the program. It’s not so much based on a pageant, but community outreach and community service — which are both things I’m passionate about.\"  Q: Describe your experience in the program. A: \"It’s been a great experience so far. They were very authentic about what we’re actually trying to do by connecting with the community and that it would be like a sisterhood by the end of it. I feel like I’ve already created a lot of great relationships with the other girls and community partners.\"  Ayesha Saeed Business Management  Q: What has been your favorite part of the program so far? A: \"Getting to know the other princesses. We all come from diverse backgrounds and majors at our universities, so it’s been nice to learn about everyone’s interests and support the girls at their outreaches.\"  Q: What kind of outreach have you done in the community? A: \"I’ve been working with Gigi’s Playhouse, which is a Down Syndrome Achievement Center; it’s something I’m really passionate about because I have family members with down syndrome. On March 21, which is Down Syndrome Day, we all dyed socks together.\"  Ishita Sameer Bhedi Biomedical Engineering  Q: Why did you apply for the 500 Festival Princess Program? A: \"I’m an international student, so Indy has been my second home away from home. It’s my senior year, so what better way to celebrate that than by giving back to the community that has really housed me over the past four years? So, I thought this program was the perfect opportunity.\"  Q: What has been your favorite part of the program so far? A: \"When we got our sash and crown and everything sunk in, which was during our orientation. It was also one of the first days where I got to meet the other 32 princesses, who are all from different towns and universities around Indiana.\"  Hannah Romero De Gante Health Science, Pre-Occupational Therapy  Q: Why did you apply for the 500 Festival Princess Program? A: \"The program is very community, scholarship and leadership based. And I’m very passionate about giving back to my community. So when I saw something that aligned with my goals as well, it inspired me to apply. I’m really hoping to grow in my leadership through this program.\"  Q: What kind of outreach have you done in the community? A: \"I’m from a small town in Seymour, Ind. and wanted to focus most of my outreaches there because of how important my hometown is to me. My community there shaped me to be who I am today. I went back to my personal elementary school, high schools, and other schools in the area to talk about my journey as a 500 Festival Princess.  My hope has been to inspire all, especially the English learning community, in knowing how helpful others were in my growth. As a child, it was inspiring to see someone from my own community flourish, and it is only my hope to inspire someone just as much.\" "

Along this journey, students will have many opportunities to reflect upon their classroom and cocurricular learning, develop their expertise in their chosen field, and grow as a human being. Students will become acquainted with each of the Profiles —communicator, problem solver, innovator, and community contributor—beginning in general education courses and first-year experiences and continuing as students progress along their pathway through their major coursework and cocurricular activities toward their capstone or culminating experience.

Direct measurements can be through classroom assignments, presentations, portfolios, e-portfolios, tests, and essays. Indirect measurements can be through self-assessments, questionnaires, peer feedback, and end-of-course evaluations. "

While she says that using Buy.IU can be daunting, she enjoys making an impact on the department’s fiscal efforts, especially if she can save some money along the way.  If you could be in any TV show, what would it be?  I would say Whitley Gilbert from “A Different World.” She was funny, witty and beautiful. As a child, the show was how I was introduced to college. I just knew I was going to go to Hillman when I got older. If only it were real!  What's a New Year's resolution that you want to uphold?  I don’t really do New Year’s resolutions. I’m always striving to become a better person in different areas of my life, no matter what. I do focus on a word for the year – this year’s word is stewardship.  What piece of comedy has made you laugh the most? Would you recommend it to others?  My husband always sends me funny videos, especially voiceover videos. I store them and when I’ve had a long day or need a good laugh, I just watch them all back-to-back. I am usually in tears from laughing.  Laughter is truly a form of therapy for me. It gets me through some of those rough patches. I definitely share them with my friends and anyone else that might need a good hearty laugh.  What's your favorite breakfast meal?  Give me a bacon, egg and toast sandwich! It’s been my favorite since I was younger, but it has to be homemade. My dad made them for me as a kid, so it always reminds me of him when I make that sandwich.  What mythological or fictional animal best represents your personality?  Hmmm, my first thought is a unicorn. Only because in my parenting world, there’s a lot of unicorn talk. They are unique, beautiful, light and draw others in. I’d like to think I have a piece of all those characteristics. "

The event helped celebrate National Recovery Month, raise awareness about the topics of addiction and mental health and support our students in recovery.  Over $3,000 was raised for IUPUI’s Collegiate Recovery Community (CRC) — which, established in 2014, was the first college/university support program of its kind in Indiana.

Teske and his team work hard to make IUPUI the destination campus for students in recovery, and events like this help them do that.  \"We really focus on creating a place where students feel welcome and supported to do their best academic work and focus on achieving their goals,\" said Teske.  At the event, racers and walkers ages 6 to 80 years old donned their purple race shirts, got in a workout and showed off their race medals at the finish line alongside other community members.  \"A standout moment for me was seeing the way that people would stick around after they finished the 5K or mile to cheer other people on. It was great to see how supportive everyone was of people they hadn't met before,\" said Anna Comer, IUPUI student and race participant.  \"My favorite moment was hearing from a previous scholarship recipient about their recovery journey, which put context and meaning to the purpose of the race,\" said Katie Wilkinson, health and wellness specialist.  The Jaguar 5K and Mental Health Mile opened the door to having conversations about recovery and mental health and hopes to continue this effort for Recovery Months to come.  Couldn’t make it to the event, but want to show your support? Jaguars can also donate via the IUPUI Collegiate Recovery Community scholarship donation page .

    "body": "  # Prevent. Intervene. Support. April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month  By: Corin Chapman  Tuesday, April 04, 2023  This April, go beyond awareness. For Sexual Assault Awareness Month (SAAM), IUPUI is encouraging students to prevent, intervene and support when it comes to situations of sexual assault. The interpersonal violence team at CAPS is hosting several events throughout the month to equip students with the skills they need to make campus a safer place for themselves and their friends.  Andrea Jacobson, founder of the Domestic Abuse Prevention Student Organization (DAPSO) and one of the leaders of the SAAM committee, emphasizes the importance of SAAM as a student-led awareness month.  \"Our goal is to get a lot of different students across campus connected this April,\" Jacobson said. \"Many student organizations already organize their own SAAM events, or have programs to help survivors of sexual assault, so we want to highlight these student orgs and their resources this month.\"  Viviane Linos, assistant director of Interpersonal Violence Prevention and Advocacy, hopes this year’s SAAM events help students feel empowered and educated. \"To that end, our theme is: Prevent. Intervene. Support.\" she said.   #### Prevent  The best way to stop sexual assault is to know how to prevent it. Prevention education is a powerful tool for challenging the ways sexual assault is normalized in our culture. Defining consent is one of the essential components of prevention.   #### Intervene  Intervening in potentially dangerous situations is another key skill. If you find yourself as a bystander, remember the 3 Ds of intervention: Direct. Delegate. Distract. Keep in mind the goal of bystander intervention is always to de-escalate the situation and keep you and others safe.   #### Support  When supporting someone who has experienced sexual violence, it’s important to start by believing them and listening. CAPS offers a confidential advocate for students and employees who have experienced sexual or interpersonal violence at: saadv@iupui.edu   ### Be a part of the change this April:  An Open Discussion on Sexual Assault by Black Student Union (BSU) and Prevention Peer Education Program (PPEP)  Tuesday, April 11 5:30 p.m.–7:30 p.m. in Taylor Hall 2127  Join these two groups as they discuss how sexual violence impacts the Black community. CAPS will also be present to share on- and off-campus resources. Pizza will be provided.  Restored and Ready Conference hosted by Sigma Psi Zeta Sorority, Inc.  Saturday, April 15 10 a.m.–4 p.m. in the Luddy School of Informatics  In their third annual SAAM conference, Sigma Psi Zeta will create a space focused on healing and the prevention of sexual assault. This will include conversations challenging the stigmas surrounding sexual assault and how to combat the many obstacles survivors face.  Genesis Barlow, a member of Sigma Psi Zeta, hopes that conversations will continue beyond the conference. \"We intend to inspire these conversations to occur both on and off campus,\" Barlow said. \"In our previous conferences, we have reclaimed our voices, rose up and now we are restored and ready for this year’s conference.\"  Don’t miss out on other SAAM events happening throughout the month like The Clothesline Project, Take Back the Night, Denim Day and more.

Do you like to travel or to stay closer to home?  I love to travel, but my account doesn’t always agree with my vision. I do love a good road trip. I also like to try new restaurants around town. It always blows my mind when I discover a place that has been here for years, because I was born and raised in Indianapolis.  Do you have a favorite fictional character?  Black Panther has to be my top choice! He represented with such class and swagger, while dealing with a lot of people and the sins of their fathers.  If you could have a superpower, what would it be?  I would want to time travel. That way I could see more of the world. I think the weakness would come with the discovery of other countries and times and not wanting to come back.  What cooking appliance best represents you?  The air fryer, because it can cook all types of foods in many ways after you select the right setting. This represents me because I have many settings, I just need to select the right setting in life to get it done sooner rather than later. "

However, there are different reservations processes and costs for different groups.   ## IUPUI registered student organizations  Student organizations can reserve Campus Center spaces for free, so long as they are properly registered with the CUBE Student Organization Center. Once registered, all space requests must be submitted through The Spot for full consideration. The only officer position permitted to submit events for student organizations is the designated reservationist.  [The Spot](https://thespot.iupui.edu/)  Please be advised that due to the comprehensive nature of the process, it is possible to receive multiple approvals for specific aspects of an event and, ultimately, have the request denied. Members of student organizations are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the event and activity registration process through the resources provided by the CUBE Student Organization Center team . Student interest groups who are in the process of forming a student organization will be able to reserve space for three low-risk organizational meetings within a 60-day period before full registration will be required to request space.   ## IUPUI departments and schools  Departments and schools are defined as university departments and/or offices meeting to conduct business directly related to their function, operations, or mission of the university. IUPUI departments and schools can reserve space 13 months in advance. Information tables are free to reserve, and all other space reservations will incur fees.  Reservation requests from faculty and staff members on behalf of IUPUI schools and departments should be submitted online by accessing 25Live on One.IU or by using the Campus Center event form . Standard reservation requests (that do not meet the definition of a special event and/or do not require additional personnel, special equipment, or additional coordination) must be submitted a minimum of seven (7) days prior to the reservation date. Reservation requests submitted less than seven (7) days in advance may not be accommodated and the request may be denied.

Requests may also be made by phone, email, or walk-in. Please be advised that all requests submitted online are simply requests—not confirmed reservations—and can be denied by the Campus Center Event Services team. Meeting and event organizers should wait until a reservation confirmation has been received via email before continuing any planning and marketing of the event.   ## Non-university organizations  Campus Center space may be reserved by groups or organizations unaffiliated with IUPUI so long as their purpose/mission does not contradict the mission/purpose of IUPUI. Decisions related to any possible contradiction is at the discretion of the Campus Center. Space may not be used for non-university fundraising or political initiatives. Non-university organizations can submit requests by contacting the Campus Center Event Services team at 317-278-8511 or campcntr@iupui.edu .   ### Special event reservations  We have established procedures to ensure we provide appropriate support and planning for your special events. Please read the definition below to see if your event could be considered a special event.

    "body": "  # Student volunteers and employees shine on the Paws’ Pantry team  By: Corin Chapman  Wednesday, May 10, 2023  Paws' Pantry is an essential resource for the IUPUI community, providing many students who experience food insecurity access to the free food and toiletries they need. Last semester, Paws' Pantry served 3,312 students, staff and faculty. To accomplish this and serve the campus community, Paws' Pantry moves thousands of pounds of food each semester ­ — both literally from supply trucks and then into the hands of customers — a task that would be impossible without its dedicated student team.  \"Our student team continues to amaze me every day,\" Andi Weidner, Paws' Pantry assistant, said. \"They consistently go above and beyond to make sure that the pantry is clean, stocked and running smoothly. We are all a team, and without each other, the pantry would not be what it is today.\"  The current student team is made up of 23 lead volunteers and five executive staff members, all of whom commit time each week to this invaluable service. Lead volunteers stock the pantry, assist patrons of the pantry and make sure the pantry is clean and accessible. Executive staff members run Paws' Pantry behind the scenes by making sure there is enough food and supplies to serve the IUPUI student population.  Leslie Vazquez, a student member of the executive team, appreciates the community she’s been able to build through her work.  \"I love talking to the people who come into Paws' Pantry, and with the different volunteers,\" Vazquez said. \"Getting to help people and to restock the pantry are some of my favorite parts of the job. The Paws' Pantry team is always nice and helpful, which makes working here really fun.\"  Learn more about Paws' Pantry's services and volunteer efforts by visiting their web page and following them on Instagram .

    "body": "  # IUPUI participates in its first Suicide Prevention Awareness Month  By: Grace Wothke  Tuesday, September 19, 2023  Mental health is often a topic that is avoided in day-to-day conversation and may be uncomfortable or deemed \"taboo\" to talk about. September marks the beginning of Suicide Prevention Awareness Month (SPAM), which aims to not only talk about, but share ways on how students can get involved in educating people on suicide.  This marks the first year that IUPUI is engaging in SPAM, and Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) aims to create a community of care by hosting events throughout the month to continue this important conversation.   ### Feel confident in talking about mental health  \"Our goal is to promote connection, community, awareness, and support — all of which we know contributes to prevention,\" said Assistant Director of Outreach and Community Services Brittany Snyder.  In addition to the planned SPAM September events , CAPS will be running a Mental Health First Aid training this semester for anyone interested at no cost.  [SPAM September events](http://go.iupui.edu/SPAM)  \"We want campus to feel confident in talking about mental health with each other, in how we support one another,\" Snyder said.   ### Warning signs and addressing the topic with your peers  Warning signs are often overlooked and missed, which is why it is important to understand what a warning sign is and how to address it. Common warning signs include: an increase in anxiety, drastic change in sleeping patterns, expressing feelings of being trapped or hopeless, extreme mood swings, and increased substance use.  \"Checking in with each other is the first step and can be as easy as asking, ‘How are you doing?' Next, we can listen, validate someone’s experience, and let them know that they are not alone. We don’t need to have the answers or fix anything. Just being there is enough,\" said Snyder.  Prevention begins when signs are recognized and care for the individual is put into place. When you see or hear something, say something. It can save a life.   ### Facts about suicide in America  According to the CDC, suicide was the second leading cause of death for college students and one suicide happens every eleven minutes in America. In 2022, around 49,500 individuals committed suicide.  \"Mental health is health. Suicide prevention is something we need to do as a community,\" Snyder said. \"This means we provide a space for others to feel safe opening up about mental health and we make sure that all have access to resources.\"   ### Resources  If you or someone you know is struggling with mental health, there are a variety of resources both on campus and nationally that are specific to suicide and other mental health topics.  CAPS offers support groups, individual therapy sessions and other resources. Call 317-274-2548 or email ( capsindy@iu.edu ) for further information.

She views counseling as a collaborative process and is invested in working with individuals to find the perspectives, ways of relating, and coping strategies that feel most helpful to them. With this in mind, Batek strives to integrate multiple theoretical frameworks and modalities, with an emphasis on narrative, solution-focused, mindfulness, interpersonal, and anti-oppression orientations.  Over the past 19 years, Batek has worked in a number of different clinical settings, including several community-based organizations, employee assistance programs, and private practice venues. She considers herself a generalist and has engaged with individuals dealing with a wide variety of issues across the life span. Batek’s particular interests include working with persons experiencing post-trauma impacts, including military service members, grief and loss, and relational issues. "

BASICS is a brief motivational enhancement intervention for individuals emphasizing personal responsibility and self-efficacy, offering personalized feedback on risks, expectancies, perceptions of social norms, and options for reducing problems and consequences.  BASICS is not a psychological assessment, and does not diagnose or treat a substance use disorder or other mental health concerns.

You want to be supportive, but you need a bit more information or you’re worried about saying the wrong thing.  Wellness Ambassador Training equips everyday students with above-average skills to help them identify, approach, and refer classmates to the most appropriate mental health resources. Trained participants are not licensed or certified—they are friends, team members, and role models who care about the well-being of their fellow students.  Request group training  [Request group training](http://go.iupui.edu/careconnect)   ### Training format  The training helps you serve as trustworthy and approachable classmates who help find solutions to personal issues that may come up, advocate for healthy balanced lifestyles, and connect your peers to more advanced resources when necessary.  Training is flexible and customized to fit your needs. It typically includes a bundle of four 60- to 90-minute trainings covering the topics below in weekly or monthly recurring meeting times. To make things easy, you’ll work with a single point of contact who will help schedule the entire training series.   ### Perfect for existing groups  If you already have a student group or organization in place, Wellness Ambassador Training is a logical next step to give your group the skills to help your peers navigate everyday stressors. Existing groups typically have recurring meeting times and an administrative structure that serves as a launchpad to add peer support.   ### Five roles of supportive peers  1. Friend. You care deeply about the well-being of others, and you are trained how to listen for behavior concerns and signs of distress. You reduce the stigma of opening up about mental health topics with your comfortable and approachable style. 2. Team member. You are embedded within the fabric of your academic program and make connections between your peers and university resources. 3. Role model. You naturally focus on personal development and have great ideas for ways to stay happy, healthy, and whole while in school. You are an includer and positive influence to those around you. 4. Advocate. You take the pulse of the student body and understand the challenges students face firsthand. You are solutions-focused and promote positive messages in support of self-care and healthy systems. 5. Educator. You have above-average knowledge about some sensitive topics, and you share information in a way that builds confidence and removes barriers.     "

    "body": "  ## When the issues are big, your voice should be big too  Civic engagement is all about getting you in tune with the political and societal issues of the world around you. It’s important for everyone, especially college students, to be informed of the issues that affect your everyday lives. You can be a key contributor to our democracy with three simple actions: register, learn, and advocate.  Because the world around us changes daily, our programs change to keep up with the issues and topics that matter most to you.  Our Civic Engagement Assistants are IUPUI students who work throughout the year to help make engaging in democracy easy. You can contact them at 317-278-3699 or ccsecea@iupui.edu , and they are located in Campus Center 350.  “I love my job because I have the opportunity to encourage young voters just like me to vote and engage in their community.”   ### Take part in democracy by learning about your voting rights  Our voter rights and registration programs allow you to get registered to vote, learn about your rights as a voter, and learn more about how to engage in our democracy. A list of common events and programs for IUPUI students are below.   ## National Voter Registration Day  National Voter Registration Day is a nonpartisan, civic holiday celebrating our democracy. On the third Tuesday in September, we focus our in-person, virtual, and media efforts on providing you information on how to register to vote. You can visit the official online voter guide to learn how to make your voice count.  [official online voter guide](https://comenga2.sitehost.iu.edu/service-opportunities/voting-guide.html)   ## Day of Democracy  Day of Democracy is where you learn about all the ways to be civically engaged in the community. We bring in our local Marion County Board of Elections to test out the voter machines and get you familiar with the city of Indianapolis. Past special guests have included the League of Women Voters, Indiana Disability Rights, Women4Change, and more.   ## Vote Early Day  Vote Early Day will help all eligible voters learn about their voting options and celebrate the act of voting early. When Americans vote early, they ensure that last minute issues will not prevent them from casting their ballots. Saturday, October 23, 2021 is Vote Early Day .  [Vote Early Day](https://www.voteearlyday.org/)   ## National Voter Education Week  National Voter Education Week will help all voters understand all the tools and information available to be confident in casting their ballots. This week of activities is held during the first week of October.  [week of activities](https://votereducationweek.org/)   ## March to the Polls  March to the Polls is hosted during the last week of October as an opportunity to mobilize your fellow Jaguars, hear from local organizers, and conduct your civic duty with a quick trip to our nearest polling place to vote.   ## Election Day  Election Day is our time to shine! Whether you are needing directions to the nearest polling place or having an issue of what’s on the ballot, we are here to help. We will be on campus and virtually to serve you to make sure it's a smooth day at the polls.   ### Make the issues come alive  Understanding civil discourse, both what it is and how to practice it, is key to our political process, being responsible citizens, and creating change. Our Civic Engagement Assistants are available to teach your student organization, class, or team about civil discourse and the importance of voting.  Request a presentation   #### Engaging in politics  Government Relations at IU can assist you and your organization in engaging in the political process .

    "body": "  # The results are in: IUPUI is a recovery campus  By: Zach Wadley  Tuesday, October 27, 2020  Student health and wellness is always at the top of the priority list for IUPUI, and now we have data to help shine light on how students are feeling and how we can best support them. Before the COVID-19 pandemic cut the year on campus short, IUPUI participated in the National College Health Assessment (NCHA), a national survey of student health behavior. IUPUI was one of 75 colleges and universities that participated, which allows the university to benchmark itself against national reference groups.  Overall, 90.8 percent of IUPUI’s respondents self-reported being in good, very good, or excellent health, which stacked up similarly to the national reference group.  Recovery  [Collegiate Recovery Community online](https://studentaffairs.iupui.edu/health/wellness-programs/addiction-recovery.html)  Food Insecurity  [Paws’ Pantry](https://studentaffairs.iupui.edu/advocacy-resources/food-and-clothing-services.html)  Sleep  Alcohol and Marijuana  “I think some of the alcohol and marijuana numbers we see really confirm that IUPUI is not a party school,” said Eric Teske, director of health and wellness promotion. “In fact, if you look at the rates of students in recovery from past alcohol or drug use, IUPUI is much more of a recovery campus. Our students are focused and serious about finishing their degrees.”  Tobacco  [Nicotine Cessation Program](https://studentaffairs.iupui.edu/health/wellness-programs/tobacco-cessation.html)  Aside from the usage rates, Teske mentioned the unique downtown campus at IUPUI might pose different issues. He cites the fact that IUPUI students used alcohol and marijuana less frequently than the national reference group, but IUPUI had higher self-reported rates of driving after drinking and driving after using cannabis.  “I believe this reflects our commuter campus and the fact that our students live throughout the city rather than together in a single neighborhood, so the temptation to drive between locations is higher,” Teske said. “With so many rideshare options these days, our students really have an opportunity now to speak out against impaired driving and create the shared expectation with their friends to find alternatives.”  Students can visit alcohol.iupui.edu to sign the Jags Drive Sober pledge, learn more about their party habits and find resources for recovery.  [alcohol.iupui.edu](https://alcohol.iupui.edu/)  To see the full results of the 2020 survey along with past results, visit the Institutional Research and Decision Support website .

    "body": "  # #StudentAffairsWrapped: Fall highlights  By: Lexa Muehlbauer  Thursday, December 22, 2022  That’s a wrap. Just like Spotify, we’re celebrating all of Student Affairs’ fall achievements. From favorite events like Regatta to a focus on health and wellness programs, campus life at IUPUI was thriving. Check out this semester’s top highlights.   ### Move-in weekend went BIG (August 2022)  After two years of limited occupancy due to COVID-19 restrictions, Housing and Residence Life pulled out all the stops to make this year’s move-in memorable for 2,386 students living on campus. Students and families got to enjoy balloon arches, food trucks, photo op stations and a visit from President Whitten.   ### Prepare to be WOWed (Aug. 20–Sept. 2, 2022)  This fall’s Weeks of Welcome saw 15,238 students attending 43 events that spanned the first two weeks of school. Events included the 44th annual Ice Cream Social, Student Involvement Expos, SAPB Presents: First Night, and the return of Light Up the Night – IUPUI’s biggest glow event on campus.  New this year, students could also access the full WOW schedule right on their phones via the IU Mobile app.   ### Campus Recreation memberships were in high demand ( August–September 2022 )  Within the first month of school, Campus Recreation reached 5,000 members – which is the fastest amount of time ever to reach this level of membership since The Jag opened in spring 2018.   ### #YouGottaRegatta (Sept. 24, 2022)  Thousands of students, alumni and spectators cheered on 120 registered teams who raced on the canal. While boats were going head-to-head, Regatta attendees got to watch fun performances by student organizations like the DesiJags and Xiphos Corps at Military Park. Fan favorites like the Dog Costume Contest and Regatta Royalty also drew big crowds.  2022 canal race winners  Women’s Division First: Zeta Team 1 Second: Women in Science House Third: Row-Tator Cuffs  Men’s Division First: Phi Gamma Delta Second: USS Fast As Ship Third: Sigma Alpha Epsilon  Co-Ed Division First: Floss Force One Second: Bite Wing Battalion Third: Streaking Starfish   ### Vaccine clinics continued (Fall 2021–22)  From fall 2021 to November 1, 2022, Campus Health gave out 7,283 Influenza vaccines and 1,150 COVID-19 vaccines to IUPUI faculty, students and staff. 39 outreach vaccine clinics and two mass vaccines clinics – in partnership with the Indiana Immunization Coalition – were held to provide the IUPUI community with several opportunities to get immunized.   ### Let’s talk Health and Wellness (August–December 2022)  Students’ overall health and well-being is a priority at IUPUI. To help students feel their best mentally, physically and emotionally, we offer several services and programs that have continued to grow and prove successful:   ### Busting stress before finals (Dec. 5–9, 2022)  This month, 1,717 students attended Stress Busters Week events to relax and recharge. With 24 events to choose from, including chair massages, cuddling with adoptable kittens and puppies and making snow globs at the De-Stress Fairs, students were able to take a brain break and have some fun as the semester wrapped up.

    "body": "  # Free composting services available to on-campus residents  By: Corin Chapman  Friday, February 17, 2023  Play a part in making IUPUI a more sustainable campus. All on-campus residents can now enroll in IUPUI's first free Residential Compost Program. Composting is an easy and effective step to both reduce waste and reduce IUPUI's carbon footprint.  To make this new service possible at all residence halls, IUPUI has partnered with Earth Mama Compost and GreenCycle , which turn organic waste into nutrient-rich compost, to help the university close the loop and eliminate waste. The compost is then purchased and used for IUPUI's campus gardens.  [Earth Mama Compost](https://earthmamacompost.com/register)  [GreenCycle](https://greencycleindy.com/)  This program initially began in fall 2020 when the Graduate and Professional Student Government (GSPG) Sustainability and Transportation Subcommittee saw an opportunity to decrease waste via housing, and then transform that organic waste into materials for agriculture.   ### How the program is going  \"In October of this year, we collected a little over 500 lbs. of organic waste from Riverwalk Apartments, North Hall, Ball Hall and University Tower combined,\" said Christina Padilla, sustainability engagement coordinator for the Division of Finance and Administration.  \"There are currently 50 households participating, and the program has steadily been growing since its limited launch in 2021,\" she said. \"Composting programs are most successful when only those who are truly committed to doing it right take part.\"   ### How to get started composting  While all on-campus students are encouraged to sign up for the program, it's important that everyone who signs up understands the program guidelines so that they compost accurately. After students have reviewed the program guidelines, they can find the sign-up form online.  [program guidelines](https://sustainability.iupui.edu/residential-compost-program-guidelines-2022-2023.pdf)  [sign-up form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=NL4TEdGuAE2rS83QJRC-kaRe-DFKemlIlK49Jt7qDcdUMlpQMk1XOVlTSVBLRkhPTTBOUENXNUgwRyQlQCN0PWcu)  Once students have signed up for the composting program, they will receive a basket for storing compostable waste, liners for the basket and educational materials to help get started. Here are a few examples of compostable materials:  Interested in participating? On-campus residents can visit the residential compost program webpage for more information on how to join.

    "body": "  # Stalking isn’t romantic. Spread awareness on the dangers of stalking this January.  By: Corin Chapman  Friday, January 13, 2023  Did you know that 25 percent of college students are victims of stalking behavior? January is Stalking Awareness Month. IUPUI wants all students to feel safe on campus and know the signs of what is considered stalking.  \"Stalking is a really serious event, but we don’t talk about it in the same ways that we do domestic and sexual violence,\" Assistant Director of Interpersonal Violence Prevention and Advocacy Viviane Linos said. \"I think that’s because stalking is normalized in our culture.\"  Stalking is a pattern of two or more repeated, unwanted behaviors that target a specific person in order to illicit fear. This can include someone waiting outside a classroom, following you home from work or trying to excessively contact you over social media. These behaviors can often escalate into constant following and an invasion of privacy.   ### How to recognize stalking behaviors  \"If someone leaves a cup of coffee for me at work, to most people that looks like an act of kindness,\" Linos said. \"But it means that the perpetrator knows where I work, and maybe even knows how I get to work. If I’ve already told that person to leave me alone, that knowledge can be really scary.\"  What differentiates stalking behavior is that the perpetrator has been informed the behavior is unwanted, but continues to do it anyway. This type of \"persistent\" stalking behavior is often seen in romantic films and other media.  \"There are a lot of movies where somebody shows up at someone’s house with a boombox or doesn’t take no for an answer – just because they think someone’s playing hard to get,\" said Linos.  \"A lot of behaviors that are considered stalking are often portrayed as romantic.\"   ### Tips for staying safe  It is one thing to know what stalking is – it is another to know how to keep yourself and others safe both on and off campus.  \"Safety planning is when you think of possible ways to make your current situation safer,\" Linos explained. \"Maybe you share a photo of your stalker with your friends, your RA, or the staff in your residence hall. Maybe you take a different route to your classes or work for a while.\"  \"These aren’t necessarily long-term solutions, but they can help to make you as safe as possible.\"  When it comes to long-term solutions, Linos emphasized the importance of documenting stalking incidents in a log. A stalking incident log is available online and can be a great resource for holding a stalker accountable.  [stalking incident log](https://www.stalkingawareness.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SPARC_StalkingLogInstructions_2018_FINAL.pdf)  The incident log can be used as evidence to build a case against a stalker and shows the frequency of a stalker’s behavior to people who may not realize the severity of the issue.   ### Resources  On Jan. 17–19, there will be Stalking Awareness Month tablings in the Campus Center where the IPV CAPS team will teach students the signs of stalking and how to support a friend.  [Stalking Awareness Month tablings](https://events.iu.edu/studentaffairsiupui/all/search/Stalking)  Any victims of stalking can anonymously report an incident on the Office of Equal Opportunity website. The Division of Student Affairs confidential advocate can be reached through saadv@iupui.edu or at 317-274-5715. In the case of an imminent emergency, call 911 or the Indiana University police department at 317-274-7911.  [report an incident](https://oeo.iupui.edu/report-incident/index.html) "

Not only is it super empowering to change your own tire, but it can also come in handy in a pinch.  If you had to delete all but three apps from your smartphone, which ones would you keep?  I would keep:  If you had a time machine, would you go back in time or into the future?  I would go back in time for sure!

What sport would you compete in if you were in the Olympics?  If I could compete in the Olympics and be good at my sport, I would pick a winter extreme sport — something like snowboarding or downhill skiing.

To continue making student well-being a top priority on campus, the Chancellor’s Student Mental Health Council (CSMHC) was formed.  [Chancellor’s Student Mental Health Council (CSMHC)](https://chancellor.iupui.edu/initiatives-celebrations/chancellors-student-mental-health-council/index.html)  Student members will:  \"I think there's a lot of value to things that are student led or student run. Oftentimes, I think the administration tries to address mental health concerns, but it's often not effective because the administration is not in direct contact with the general student population,\" member Moriah Carmel said.  \"Having a student-led council is really important, especially considering that this community has the support of high-level administrators but is still being run by students.\"  \"There's a lot of opportunity for this council to do good and create a lot of big changes,\" said member Hayden Hurst.   ### Establishing the council  Eric Teske, director of Health and Wellness Promotion and member of the IU Mental Health Task Force, was impressed with the pool of candidates interested in taking part in IUPUI's first student mental health council.  \"Everyone from first-year students to doctoral students responded to prompts and made the case for why they wanted to join the council. I think we ended up with a dream team that is committed to making positive change,\" he said.  Students will also serve as representatives to a system-wide advisory council, sharing ideas and advocating for the needs of IU students across the state.  The CSMHC met for the first time in March to connect as a group and begin setting goals for the council.  \"[Our first meeting] was a steppingstone from where we are at currently and what we hope to do in the future. I think it went very well,\" said Hurst.   ### Looking forward  With the council's current representation, student members see an opportunity to connect with our diverse student population.  \"A lot of times when we talk about college mental health, graduate education often isn't accounted for, so I am glad that the council has both graduate and undergraduate representation,\" said Carmel.  Ultimately, CSMHC aims to be the student voice that communicates with administrators and advocates for change around student wellness.  \"The council is very invested in ensuring the well-being of all students at IUPUI,\" said member Ananya Pendela. \"I want to make sure that everyone has proper access to mental health resources and is equipped with the proper tools and coping mechanisms to help with their mental health.\"   ### Student members of the council  Moriah Carmel  Cassandra Carrillo  Michaela Di Palmo  Hayden Hurst  Michael Peck  Ananya Pendela  Saumya Saini "

    "body": "  # 5 benefits of group therapy  By: Corin Chapman  Thursday, May 18, 2023  College can be overwhelming for all students — from focusing on classes to finding your spot on campus, college represents an exciting, yet stressful period of change. To better cope with stress, many students may seek out therapy through Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS).  For anyone considering therapy options, CAPS offers free group therapy sessions Monday through Friday. Group therapy can be a great way for students to address key concerns with like-minded people. Here are five reasons why group therapy may be the right fit for you.  [CAPS offers free group therapy sessions](https://studentaffairs.iupui.edu/health/counseling-psychological/counseling-options.html)  For any questions about group therapy or other related programs, email capsindy@iupui.edu or call 317-274-2548.   ### 1. It's the college gold standard  Group therapy is highly rated in IUPUI’s student survey results. 94% of students reported that they were satisfied with their \"Understanding Self and Others\" groups, while 100% of students in other groups stated that the groups were helpful.  \"Attending group therapy with classmates and peers who are experiencing similar life events and challenges can be extremely healing,\" said Ashley Eppich, a licensed mental health counselor at CAPS. \"Many college students find group therapy more helpful than individual therapy.\"   ### 2. Group therapy can help with loneliness and isolation  For students struggling with loneliness, group therapy offers students a safe place to interact with others in person and is an opportunity to meet new people and socialize.   ### 3. There are a wide variety of options tailored to student needs  This summer, CAPS is running five different types of groups specialized to specific mental health needs. Group topics include Cultivating Mindful Self-compassion, Understanding Self and Others, Mindfulness-based Art Therapy Space, Community Healthing Space and Coping 101.  All of these groups aim to help students in more specific, meaningful ways.   ### 4. It's free for all IUPUI students  It is important for our campus community that group therapy is accessabile to all students — that is why CAPS has made sure that all group therapy is free and accessible. They also provide a free, thorough assessment in order to recommend the best group for each student.   ### 5. All sessions are facilitated by licensed therapists  CAPS is dedicated to providing students with the highest quality experience possible.  \"Personally, leading my group, Community Healing Space, is one of the highlights of my week,\" said Eppich. \"I enjoy getting to witness students help one another. The discussion that happens in group is rich, affirming and validating. I encourage all students to try group therapy at least once.\" "

    "body": "  ## Stay the course  You’ve made amazing changes in your life, and you’re on the road to recovery. Maybe what you're looking for now is a group of peers who understand what it’s like to travel that road while in college. The Collegiate Recovery Community (CRC) at IUPUI is your chance to connect with fellow Jags and be supported while you maintain your recovery.  The overall goal of the CRC is a simple one: provide social support and a referral network with access to community resources, regardless of whether you are recovering from substance abuse, behavioral addictions such as gambling or sex, or something else altogether.   ### Find strength in numbers  We currently provide weekly peer support groups for a variety of recovery needs. There are also general CRC meetings where you can help plan awareness events, social outings, and volunteer opportunities. Regardless of what you are recovering from, there is a support network in place to help you succeed.  If you’re looking for more individualized support, you can work with a recovery coach. This person can motivate you and help you solve problems. They are not a counselor or a sponsor, and they don’t replace a therapist or physician. However, they can be a valuable mentor on your path to recovery. When you work with a recovery coach, you will:  If you feel you would benefit from a therapist or doctor, contact Counseling and Psychological Services or visit the Help Me R.O.A.R. website for community resources. You can also find more information about recovery and recovery support from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) .  [Help Me R.O.A.R.](https://helpmeroar.iupui.edu/)  [Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)](https://www.samhsa.gov/recovery)   ### Weekly support meetings  In-person and virtual support meeting times and locations are posted on the campus events calendar.  [meeting times and locations](https://events.iu.edu/studentaffairsiupui/all/tags/CRC)   ### Recovery community contacts  To learn more about addiction recovery services at IUPUI, contact Health and Wellness Promotion at 317-274-3699 or hwpindy@iupui.edu or the Collegiate Recovery Community student organization at recovery@iupui.edu .  [Tweets by @RecoveryIUPUI](https://twitter.com/RecoveryIUPUI)  [https://www.facebook.com/recoveryiupui/](https://www.facebook.com/recoveryiupui/)   ### Recovery group FAQs  If you’re new to the recovery community, you might have a few questions. If, after checking out our FAQs, you still are unsure if the CRC is right for you, contact Health and Wellness Promotion .   #### What’s the difference between a CRC meeting and a support meeting?  CRC meetings are for the collegiate recovery community as a whole, meaning they’re open to allies, friends, recovery advocates, and volunteers as well as those in recovery. They’re great for planning awareness events and networking. Support meetings are topic-specific groups for students in recovery.   #### Who can attend support meetings?  Our peer support meetings are intended for individuals who are in recovery for specific issues. However, meetings may be considered “open.” In this case, students might try out the meeting to see if it’s right for them, and others might bring guests with them.   #### Are support meetings anonymous?  We respect anonymity. As a support group participant, you are not required to sign in or provide identifying information. However, our meetings are considered open, meaning you may encounter a friend or guest who is not in recovery themselves.   #### Are support meetings the same as AA meetings?  No. Our peer support meetings focus on sharing successes, challenges, support, and understanding. We are not affiliated with any national or 12-step programs, nor do we follow a specific curriculum. Many of our participants also attend other types of recovery meetings in addition to our on-campus support groups.  [recovery meetings](https://facesandvoicesofrecovery.org/resources/mutual-aid-resources/)   #### Can I attend a support meeting for a class assignment or to satisfy a court order?  No. However, you may contact the CRC at recovery@iupui.edu for help finding an open meeting in the community to meet your requirement.   #### Can I observe a support meeting?  Support meetings are intended for students who are in recovery. If you are curious about recovery but are not in recovery yourself, contact the CRC at recovery@iupui.edu . They can connect you with ways to volunteer or network with other students.   ### Use your voice  If you are willing to speak out about your recovery, we offer educational outreach opportunities such as awareness events, campus presentations, and panel discussions. With your help, we can challenge the stigma surrounding addiction recovery. Share your story of addiction recovery by emailing recovery@iupui.edu . You can also subscribe to our newsletter. "

The university makes all assignments without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, or veteran status and rejects all requests for changes of assignment based on such.   ### Roommate request process  If you want to live on campus with a specific person, there is a process to follow to ensure we place you in the correct rooms.  Your roommate requests must be mutual—meaning you both have to request each other. Additionally, you both must request a specific Residential Based Learning Community or not. Choosing different RBLCs, for example, could impact you being placed as roommates.  The roommate request process is open April through June of each year, with students receiving their assignments and roommate information in mid-July.   ### Contract details  From billing details to behavioral expectations, your housing contract is an important document that you should be familiar with.

    "body": "  # Get To Know: Adair Allen, graphic designer  By: Lexa Muehlbauer  Tuesday, June 20, 2023  IUPUI graduate Adair Allen went to the Herron School of Art + Design and got her degree in visual communication design. During her undergrad, Adair was an intern at the Multimedia Production Center and lived in Ball Hall her freshman year, where she found real community.  Her experience living on campus and involvement with student organizations will come in handy as the division’s new graphic designer. Adair is excited to be back and looks forward to helping our students learn about involvement opportunities on campus.  What song do you know every word to?  \"The Spins\" by Mac Miller. It's the perfect song to roll down the car windows to.  If you weren’t a designer, what would you be?  A makeup artist on a movie set!  If you had to be on a reality TV show, which one would it be and why?  I've been re-watching \"America's Next Top Model\" lately, so I think I would do well on that show. I have good time management skills and know how to stay out of drama, so who knows? I might make it into the final four one day.  What topic could you give a TedTalk on right now?  I think I could do a TedTalk about the Twilight franchise. I was so into it when I was younger and consumed every piece of media that came out. I'm not saying it would be a good TedTalk, but I could certainly fill the time allotted. "

Our self-assessments address concerns such as suicide and self-harm, depression, anxiety, trauma and abuse, and alcohol and other drugs. These tools are educational—not diagnostic. If you need additional support, call or email CAPS.  Start your self-screening  [Start your self-screening](https://screener.ulifeline.org/?_ga=2.11612148.1349901817.1595118543-714065962.1595118543)   ### Additional information and self-help and crisis resources   #### CAPS crisis services  If you’re experiencing suicidal thoughts, are having trouble completing daily tasks, or are facing an acute stressor that threatens the safety of yourself or others, we’ll arrange a same-day emergency appointment.  CAPS’ on-call counselors are available 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday. Call us at 317-274-2548.   #### Suicide and self-harm  Have you been thinking about ending your life or hurting yourself? Are you feeling overwhelmed? There are people who will listen. Consider reaching out to one of the 24-hour hotlines listed below. Then contact CAPS to find ways to stay safe and build the life you want to live.  If you or someone you know is in immediate danger of suicide, call 911 immediately or call the IU Police Department emergency line at 317-274-7911.   #### Depression, anxiety, and mood disorders  If you’ve been feeling sad, irritable, helpless, or get easily frustrated, you may be experiencing depression, anxiety, or another mood disorder. Any of these can interfere with your function and ability to complete day to day tasks.  Mood disorders can include:  Stress and nervousness are natural parts of life. However, worries that interfere with your ability to participate in daily life are not. In addition to extreme worry, clinical anxiety may include fear or avoidance of specific situations, intrusive thoughts, repetitive behaviors, or persistent or intrusive memories of a past trauma. You may also experience physical symptoms of distress such as a racing heart, difficulty breathing, shaking, or nausea.   #### Trauma, abuse, and assault  A traumatic event often involves a physical threat to life or safety such as a natural disaster, an accident, or a human act. But any situation that leaves you feeling overwhelmed or powerless can be considered traumatic and lead to strong emotional reactions. Common reactions include:  Every individual will have their own emotional response, and your reactions will likely change over time. Understanding that these reactions are normal following a traumatic event can help you on the road to recovery.  Some people will also experience symptoms such as anxiety, intrusive memories, flashbacks, hypervigilance, and avoidance for an extended period of time. This may be post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and can often be treated with a combination of medication and counseling. We can help you find effective ways to cope with your symptoms and find a sense of meaning in your life as a trauma survivor.  [post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)](https://www.ptsd.va.gov/)  Sexual abuse, rape, stalking and other types of sexual misconduct are forms of violence. These acts, which occur any time a person does not actively consent to a sexual interaction, are not about sex. They are about power and control. If you have been affected by a sexual assault or harassment, relationship violence, including intimidation, controlling behavior or physical violence, or other forms of trauma, find support and resources from CAPS or the assistant director of interpersonal violence prevention and response by emailing saadv@iupui.edu .  [forms of violence.](https://stopsexualviolence.iu.edu/)   #### Alcohol and other drugs  There are many misconceptions about alcohol and drug use in college. This can sometimes cause students to consume more than is healthy or in ways that don’t match their personal values. Are you concerned about your drinking or substance use? Have you found yourself wondering how much is too much?  If you need help, you can reach out to our Health and Wellness Promotion team at hwpindy@iupui.edu .  You can also take self-screening quizzes, learn the laws and policies, and learn tips to safely drinking on our alcohol and other drugs website .  [alcohol and other drugs website](https://alcohol.iupui.edu/index.html)   #### Body image and eating concerns  Food can fuel our bodies, but it can also be used to help us cope with emotional and mental distress. Eating can be a source of comfort and calming, while restricting consumption can provide a sense of control.  Many people respond to life stressors by altering their eating behavior. This may lead to medical complications if left untreated. Excessive food restriction, chronic binging and/or purging, or focused attempts to attain the “perfect body” can be signs of disordered eating.  If you or someone you care about is afraid of gaining weight or is concerned about their eating habits, complete a self-assessment, or contact CAPS.   #### Personal Wellness Inventory  This assessment will help you identify which of the eight dimensions of wellness is your strongest and which you might benefit from spending extra time developing. It’s a free tool for you to access online.  Learn more "

    "body": "  # A day in the life of an RA  By: Corin Chapman  Tuesday, December 13, 2022  IUPUI’s on-campus living experience wouldn’t be the same without talented and supportive resident assistants (RAs). These students dedicate themselves to serving their campus communities, whether it be through assisting residents with their maintenance issues, organizing group events or by simply being there for students when they need help.   ### APPLY TO BE AN RA  RA applications for the 2023–24 school year are open until Dec. 16 . This position comes with many benefits like free room and board, a monthly stipend and the opportunity to become more connected at the university – but it’s also a huge commitment. For more information, visit the the RA FAQ or email Cassie Govert at cegovert@iupui.edu .  [RA applications for the 2023–24 school year are open until Dec. 16](https://housing.iupui.edu/academics-leadership/get_involved/become-an-ra.html)  [the RA FAQ](https://housing.iupui.edu/academics-leadership/get_involved/become-an-ra.html)  Curious about what the job entails? Miranda Bishop, Mayowa Awosika and Ethan Stevenson from Riverwalk Apartments share what a typical day looks like as an RA.   ### Miranda Bishop’s morning  Hi! My name is Miranda Bishop, and I'm an RA at Riverwalk. I've been in this position for the past semester, and I love it. As a social work student, I wanted to become an RA to develop a community on campus.  My normal routine is pretty busy – I have a full class load, an internship and my duties as an RA to balance.  8 a.m. – When I wake up in the morning, I usually have a few texts from residents asking me questions. These questions are pretty easy to answer – typically residents have a maintenance issue or are asking about events coming up on campus. So, I send them answers and do some homework before heading to my first class of the day.  9:30 a.m. – Before class starts, one of my residents texts me and asks if we can meet for coffee later that day. I text them back and tell them that I can meet in between classes.  10:30 a.m. – After class, I meet with my resident at Caribou Coffee in the Campus Center. My resident, who is a freshman, explains that they are having a hard time keeping up with their class load. They’re stressed about completing all their assignments on time.  I tell my resident everything will be okay and that a lot freshmen experience this too. Then, I point them to the Virtual Care Support page on Canvas , which gives students tools to better cope with stress. I make a note to check in with them later in the month to see how things are going and head to my next class.  [Virtual Care Support page on Canvas](https://expand.iu.edu/courses/virtual-care-support)  Being an RA is about balance. I love connecting with my students, but it’s also important that I set boundaries.   ### Mayowa Awosika’s afternoon  My name is Mayowa Awosika and I'm also an RA at Riverwalk. When I was in high school, one of my cousins was an RA. Hearing about the community they were able to create inspired me to apply for the position. I've been at Riverwalk for the last two years and I still love it.  3 p.m. – I go to my last class for the day and then respond to some emails from work. To unwind, I relax and catch up on House of Dragon before wrapping up more homework.  4:15 p.m. – I decide to go grocery shopping for the upcoming week and run into one of my residents in the hallway. We talk for a while, and they tell me a funny story from one of their classes.  5:30 p.m. – When I get back to my apartment in Riverwalk, I still have a few hours of free time. I get ahead on some of my projects before planning out a movie night for my unit just before Winter Break.  Planning community events is a great way for all my residents to get together and make new connections. I send out a Doodle poll through my community’s GroupMe asking what movie my residents want to watch. The overwhelming answer is \"50 First Dates.\" After that, I finish some homework and relax for the rest of the night.   ### Ethan Stevenson’s night  My name is Ethan Stevenson, and I'm an RA at Riverwalk Apartments too. I wanted to be an RA so I could be more involved in the IUPUI community and have a job on campus. Before that, I lived at North Hall and my RA there said that I'd be a good fit for the position.  It's my turn to be the RA on duty tonight. To best serve our residents, every two weeks RAs have to take an \"on-duty\" shift. From 9 p.m. to 8 a.m., the RA on duty is ready to respond to any calls or concerns residents might have.  After a long day of classes, I relax for a few hours before my shift begins.  9 p.m. – I meet with the other RA and we walk around Riverwalk Apartments doing rounds to make sure everything is okay. For the next hour, things are pretty quiet.  I only have to be the RA on duty once every two weeks. This means that I and another RA will hold the duty phone, which students can call in case of emergencies or if they need immediate help.  10 p.m. – We get a call from a resident saying two of their roommates have gotten into a heated argument. I go to their room and sit the residents down, pulling up the roommate agreement form that they signed near the beginning of the semester.  Using the agreement form, the argument is settled, and both roommates apologize to one another. I resume rounds, happy that I was able to help.  1 a.m. – A frazzled resident calls the duty phone and tells us that they are locked out of their room. I stop by and let them in, and they thank me before heading to bed. The rest of my shift is calm as my partner and I continue to do rounds around Riverwalk.  8 a.m. – The next morning my duties end, and I go to bed, ready to catch a few hours of sleep before my first class. Being an RA means wearing many hats to support my residents, but I am always happy to know that I’ve helped them feel at home.  Thank you to Miranda Bishop, Mayowa Awosika and Ethan Stevenson for agreeing to participate in this article. "

    "body": "  # Get To Know: Logan Bromm, student conduct specialist  By: Corin Chapman  Wednesday, November 30, 2022  Logan Bromm joined the Office of Student Conduct on Oct. 31 and has been coordinating sessions for the University Hearing Commission since. In his position, Logan upholds IUPUI's Code of Student Conduct by performing background checks and investigating alleged violations of the code.  What was the last book you read?  My partner and I recently read \"Handbook for a Post-Roe America.\"  I consider it a must read for anyone who is struggling with what comes next after the Dobbs decision.  What's your comfort food?  Fettucine children alfredo is hands down my favorite meal. Call me crazy, but there's something comforting about loading up on carbs while watching a terrible movie after a bad day.  Do you have a favorite spot in Indy?  I love the Monon Trail. I bike it often with my partner and love getting to see the wide range of scenery Indianapolis has to offer. I haven’t biked the whole trail yet, but I hope to soon.  What’s your ideal day?  My ideal day starts off with sleeping in late. Waking up well rested, I would grab my partner and puppy and go hike at one of the nearby state parks. Fort Harrison is our favorite because our puppy loves to swim in the creeks. Next, we’d eat lunch at one of my favorite restaurants, like Bazbeaux or Yats. At some point during the day, we would also watch one of my guilty pleasure TV shows, like \"Grey’s Anatomy\" or \"Downton Abbey.\"  What is your favorite sense (taste, touch, smell, etc.)?  Since I’m such a foodie, I’d have to choose taste. I love trying new foods. "

Emergencies—academic and personal—happen, and when they do, you need to know someone’s got your back. That’s why we’re here.  When you need a caring, knowledgeable, and supportive champion, we are in your corner.  When you’re having an academic problem, we can help you navigate university policies and find the appropriate support services.

Communicate directly with your professors if you are unable to attend classes. Depending on the policies for a particular course or department, they may request documentation such as a doctor’s note.  We do not provide oversight for academic units or faculty. However, in an emergency situation such as hospitalization, we can contact your instructors if you will miss class for three or more days or are unable to inform them directly. We recommend talking with your instructors as soon as possible to discuss accommodations and make-up procedures for your courses. A withdrawal from classes may be necessary for extended absences.   #### Dropping classes  There are several deadlines each term for dropping classes. If you can no longer drop a class on your own through One.IU —this deadline is usually the first week of the term—you must meet with your academic advisor. More information about dropping classes can be found through the Office of the Registrar .

Being hospitalized, a death in your immediate family, or being the victim of a crime are just a few examples of what might constitute an emergency. If you aren’t sure if your situation warrants an emergency withdrawal, we can help you figure it out.  You may need documentation to withdraw from a class. Your documentation should provide your contact information, including name, address, and phone and fax numbers, as well as answer the questions below. It should also be signed and dated. We can help you submit this documentation.   ### Emergency financial support  Our student advocacy team can help connect you to on-campus and community resources when you’re in a financial pinch.

Our four residence halls offer unique features and amenities, are walkable to many academic buildings, and have access to the JagLINE , our campus’ free shuttle system.  [the JagLINE](https://parking.iupui.edu/transportation/bus/bus.html)   ### Ball Hall  First-year students can find modern amenities at an economical price. In 2021, a $16.4 million renovation was completed to provide essential updates to this historic building. Approximately 325 first-year students reside in Ball Hall each year in single, double, or triple rooms.   #### Ball Hall virtual tour  Watch this video to learn more about our campus’ oldest residence hall.     #### Ball Hall 360 tour  This video takes you on a 360 tour, so you can further explore the residence hall.     #### Ball Hall history  Ball Residence Hall was originally built in 1928 and was made possible by a gift from the Ball brothers of Muncie, Ind. In the original construction, Ball Hall featured a gymnasium, library, offices, house-mother apartment, classrooms, and laboratories. Today, remnants of these original features and the classic architecture of 1928 can be seen throughout the residence hall. Ball Annex was later constructed in two phases to provide additional housing for student nurses. The first two floors were constructed in 1945 followed by the third and fourth floors in 1957. In the summer of 2013, Ball Hall received several facility upgrades including a lobby renovation, new resident furniture in every room, and every resident room was repainted. Ball Hall recently underwent a $16.7 million renovation which included adding air conditioning to the resident rooms, newly constructed bathrooms, and updates to the building's infrastructure.   ### University Tower  With private bathrooms in every room, University Tower offers first-year students beautiful views of the city skyline and quick access to three dining options. Home to 600 first-year students each year, each room is a triple and has a private bathroom.   #### University Tower virtual tour  Watch this video to learn more about all that University Tower has to offer.     #### University Tower 360 tour  This video takes you on a 360 tour, so you can further explore the residence hall.     #### University Tower history  University Tower, formerly the University Place Hotel, was once a four-diamond hotel and conferencing staple in downtown Indianapolis. With the increasing demand for on-campus student housing and classroom space—and the need to reassess the viability of continuing hotel and conference center operations—the decision to convert this facility from a hotel and conference center to first-year student housing, classroom space, and a traditional university dining facility was announced in the spring of 2012. With only 14 months of preparation, the hall welcomed its inaugural first-year class in fall 2013.   ### North Hall  Our campus’ newest residential facility, North Hall was designed with a focus on giving students plenty of common spaces—30 to be exact—to interact, study, and socialize. This hall combines traditional style living with modern convenience to about 680 students each year, offering single rooms, single rooms with private bathrooms, and double rooms.   #### North Hall virtual tour  Watch this video to learn more about all that North Hall has to offer.     #### North Hall 360 tour  This video takes you on a 360 tour, so you can further explore the residence hall.     #### North Hall history  North Hall opened in 2016 and was designed with a focus on giving students plenty of common spaces to interact, study, and socialize. It’s located next to University Tower and the Campus Recreation Outdoor Facility. North Hall provides housing for over 600 students.   ### Riverwalk Apartments  A versatile facility with options to fit your needs, Riverwalk features apartment- and townhome-style living. All of Riverwalk's living options include a full kitchen, washer and dryer in each unit, and all utilities are included in the rental costs. Select spaces are available for first-year students who need accommodations.   #### Riverwalk 360 tour (two-bedroom apartment)     #### Riverwalk 360 tour (four-bedroom apartment)     #### Riverwalk history  Originally named Campus Apartments on the River Walk, buildings opened in 2003 and 2004 as construction was completed in phases on the former site of Warthin Apartments. Each of the buildings in Riverwalk Apartments were named in honor of a past campus community leader.   ### Housing costs and amenities  We understand that cost is an important factor when deciding where you live. From extensive programs and events to exclusive housing scholarship opportunities, living on campus gives you more opportunities to connect and succeed as you pursue your degree.  Room rates for 2024-25 will be available soon, as they are determined by the Indiana University Board of Trustees. You can expect to see anywhere from a 2 to 5% increase from the 2023-24 rates listed below. Rates are per student per semester.

If you could appear on any game show, which one would you choose and why?  I would be on \"Jeopardy,\" hands down. I love trivia.

Something I’ve learned about myself in the past year is that you can do hard things even when you don’t feel like you can.  What’s something on your desk that cheers you up during the day?  The game-worn Notre Dame football helmet on the table near my desk always makes me smile and brings back the best memories. "
