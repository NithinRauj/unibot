    "body": "  ## Preparing for Your Interview  Your preparation before the interview is almost as important as the interview itself. Your potential employer notices when you have spent time researching and preparing for your interview. Be sure to do your research.   ## Interview Prep Prompts   ### Practice responding (out loud!) to common interview questions.   ### Strategies for Answering Common Questions  “Tell me about yourself.” Intent: Short summary of your professional self – not your life history!  “What is your greatest weakness?” Intent: Can you think critically about your professional skills?   ### Be sure to follow up.  Send a thank-you email to your interviewer at least 24 hours after your interview. Reference any topics from your interview, but be brief in length.   ### Interview Questions about Your Behavior  Behavior-based interview questions are used to determine how your past performance could demonstrate your future potential. Think ahead about these questions.   ### Examples of Behavior-Based Interview Questions  Screening/First Round  Conducted by an HR recruiter and short: 20-30 minutes.  Intent: Do you meet the minimum qualifications?  Present how your skills, abilities and experiences meet the company’s needs.  Panel  Conducted with three or more people with area expertise knowledge similar to yours.  Intent: To learn more about your area of interest.  Direct answers to the person asking the question, but maintain eye contact with other members.  One-on-One  Conducted with one person.  Intent: To assess your skills, knowledge and abilities related to the job.  Sell key strengths and inquire about challenges. Suggest skills you bring to help resolve issues.  Peer Group  Conducted with your potential co-workers.  Intent: To learn more about your ability to work with co-workers or a team.  Focus on being approachable rather than someone with all the answers.  Luncheon  Conducted in a restaurant with a potential supervisor, HR recruiter and co-workers.  Intent: To assess how you handle yourself in social situations.  Choose an easy-to-eat, moderately-priced meal. When in doubt, ask for a recommendation from the employer.  Second Round  Similar to a first-round interview, but longer and involving more people with a combination of interview types.  Intent: To ensure you have the necessary skills for the job and you will blend well with the company culture.  Focus on selling yourself as a well-balanced package. Listen to concerns carefully and dispel them.   ## Interview Formats  Phone Interview  Video Interview  In-Person Interview   ## Need help preparing for your interview?

Our flexible delivery model is based on the typical physician learning style that increases long-term retention of knowledge. Our curriculum translates best business practices into healthcare application, equipping you with the critical principles you will need to direct the future of healthcare.

Or how to use strategic analysis to evaluate and change organizational capabilities; the same tools used by top management teams of today's leading organizations.   ## Year Two  In your second year in the program, you’ll apply this business foundation to the healthcare industry through courses specifically designed at the intersection of business and medicine—courses you will not find in any other MBA program. From specialized courses on healthcare delivery models, Lean Six Sigma and understanding consumer healthcare, to traveling to Washington, D.C. to better understand healthcare policy or experiencing global healthcare settings firsthand in India or Germany, these courses will introduce you to new approaches, tools and ways of thinking that you can incorporate into your organization immediately.   ## Leadership Coaching  Solidify your leadership training with hands-on coaching during the second year of your Physician MBA. This specialized course integrates everything you’ve learned to take your career to the next level. Develop a leadership plan, learn how to navigate the politics of your organization, get to know your own leadership style and work one-on-one with a coach to put your goals into motion.  Learn more about leadership coaching   ## Applied Learning  The theory that you will gain from your professors and peers in the classroom is made real and applied in several real-world, consulting settings:   ### Integrative Experiences  You'll have an opportunity to integrate business and clinical knowledge using a live case study from the healthcare industry. Working in competing, self-managed physician teams, you'll analyze a sponsoring organization's problem or opportunity and prepare and present a business plan or solution to industry and academic experts.   ### Global Healthcare  Immerse yourself in a global healthcare experience outside of the United States. This elective course offers you the opportunity to examine best practices from other countries as well as learn about their healthcare models such as clinical trials, medical tourism and operations in India or medical technology and device manufacturing in China.   ### Healthcare Reform  Travel to Washington D.C. to learn first-hand about healthcare reform and public policy through coursework at the Washington Campus, a non-profit, non-partisan educational organization educating business students and business leaders on the practices and realities of public policy.

    "body": "  ## Associate Faculty and Executive Coach  Jennifer Robin has been coaching physicians and facilitating executive development for more than 20 years. An industrial and organizational (I/O) psychologist, award-winning author, and expert in great workplace cultures, Robin says she enjoys the engagement and practicality physicians bring to their career development. “Continuous improvement is part of the job for people who are attracted to the field of medicine. Physicians are truly lifelong learners. It's one of the many reasons I enjoy coaching physicians,” says Robin. “They’re very practical. Concepts are important, but at the end of the day, they want to apply the information to create positive outcomes.” Robin has coauthored three books about building culture and creating great workplaces: “No Excuses: How You Can Turn Any Workplace into a Great One (2013),” “The Great Workplace: How to Build It, How to Keep It, and Why It Matters (2011),” and “A Life in Balance: Finding Meaning in a Chaotic World (2006).” Drawing upon her expertise in these areas, Robin instructs physicians in the Conflict Resolution and Negotiation course in the Physician MBA Program. While most physicians have some working knowledge of negotiating contracts throughout their careers, the takeaways from this course include an understanding of the larger picture—concepts like trust and values, ways to approach difficult situations, and a toolbox of influencing skills. “Physicians tell me they are increasingly responsible for negotiating their titles as healthcare evolves and leadership trajectories are changing. As they move into leadership roles, physicians also begin negotiating on behalf of their teams as well,” says Robin. “Even though they may have experienced negotiation, negotiating on behalf of a team or project involves different techniques.”    Even though they may have experienced negotiation, negotiating on behalf of a team or project involves different techniques.  Robin is a psychologist—a background she brings into teaching physicians about negotiation and conflict resolution. The underpinnings of negotiation and conflict resolution tie directly to the psychology of perspective-taking; understanding not only what’s important to the physician, but also to the person on the other side of the table.  “We often don’t take into account what’s important to the other person, even though there is a great deal of personal, value-based information available,” says Robin. “I feel strongly that all situations are opportunities to build trust and ensure you’re not only looking at the issues at hand, but also how they enhance your relationship and increase trust going forward.”  All situations are opportunities to build trust and ensure you’re not only looking at the issues at hand, but also how they enhance your relationship and increase trust going forward.  Throughout her years in executive education instruction and physician career coaching, Robin says the content—like many courses in the Physician MBA Program—is best delivered in a collaborative, group-learning setting. Peer learning allows everyone to learn from the faculty as well as a diverse group of physicians.  “I hope to share insights physicians find useful, but I’m not doing my job well if they learn more from me than they do from each other. This course involves a lot of discussion, reflection, and responses to cases and situations, asking questions and suggesting alternate solutions. Surveying the knowledge in the room is part of our job as educators,” says Robin. “When it comes to coaching, I wear a different hat. Certainly, you will gain a lot of business acumen through the Physician MBA Program, but for many, career coaching becomes a personalized pathway to develop aspects of themselves that allow them to maximize their business acumen. That’s a valuable takeaway from this program.\" "

The Kelley School of Business in downtown Indianapolis offers a host of dual degree programs — allowing you to customize your education for your specific career goals. In all of our dual degree options, you earn two degrees in less time and at a lower cost than it would take to pursue them individually. You can obtain a Kelley MBA alongside a degree in law , medicine and accounting — all from highly respected programs.  [law](https://blog.kelley.iupui.edu/2019/06/10/jd-mba-student-expands-perspective-and-experience-with-dual-degree/)  [medicine](https://blog.kelley.iupui.edu/2019/04/11/md-student-earning-dual-mba-degree-gains-business-credentials-and-valuable-insight/)  I always knew I wanted to be a clinician, but as I spent more time in healthcare, I realized that in order to have a larger impact I needed to have financial literacy and leadership skills that an MBA offers.  Throughout the dual degree program, many courses were transferable. What I learned from my Evening MBA courses applied to classes in my Master of Science in Accounting (MSA) Program and vice versa. The combination of these two degrees worked perfectly for me.   ### Program Options  MBA dual degree programs are offered through partnerships with the IU McKinney School of Law in Indianapolis and the IU School of Medicine, as well as within the Kelley School of Business.   #### JD/MBA   #### About the Program  The JD/MBA dual degree permits the concurrent study of graduate law and graduate business coursework, leading to the Master of Business Administration (MBA) and Doctor of Jurisprudence (JD) degrees.   #### Program Candidates  This program is designed for individuals who want to practice law involving business clients, work in a corporate law department or work in a government agency regulating business, among other law and business interrelated opportunities.   #### Curriculum  The curriculum consists of a mixture of required and elective courses which provides the JD/MBA student with core knowledge of the two programs. The JD/MBA student must meet the graduation requirements of each school individually, including minimum grade point average and time-limit policies.   #### How it Works  Students spend the first year in law school and then take business and law courses concurrently for the remainder of the program. All Evening MBA core classes must be taken as intact modules.   #### Requirements  Requirements include 39 credit hours of Evening MBA courses and 80 credit hours of law courses.   #### Admission Qualifications  To qualify for admission, a candidate must:   #### More Information  Visit the McKinney School of Law for more information about admission to the JD/MBA Program.

As of February 2021, IU School of Medicine (IUSM) students considering the expedited MD/MBA should consult the IUSM website for program details or contact Becky Schlomann in the Evening MBA Program office at bschloma@iu.edu .

    "body": "  ## Associate Professor of Management Vice President for Business Development, Regenstrief Institute  “May you live in interesting times.”  Many of us recognize this phrase to be less of a birthday wish and more of a curse. We certainly live in interesting times: regulatory changes, the aging of our population, global pandemics and new technologies all intersect to affect how healthcare is practiced. Changing reimbursement models have resulted in mass industry layoffs, and consolidation of the marketplace continues as smaller practices are acquired by larger organizations. All of these factors create challenges—but also opportunities—for the educated and informed physician innovator.  For Kelley Associate Professor of Management Todd Saxton, helping companies develop competitive strategies and thrive in uncertain times like this has been a hallmark of his career.  “Strategy is not about just being operationally efficient and cutting costs,” says Saxton. “It’s about learning how to enter new arenas, take on new business or service lines, and develop new business models. Hospital systems need to be thinking about their business more strategically than they’ve ever had to before. This means learning from other models and markets, as well as identifying successful strategies from within healthcare.”  Doctors are going to have to start thinking about the broader business, which is something that they haven’t really been pushed to do before. If they want to continue to contribute to the organization, and understand how they fit in, they need to understand how they’re contributing to the economic vitality of the organization.  But the need to think strategically doesn’t stop with hospital administrators.  “I think the individual doctors, whether or not they’re getting into administration, need to think about more than just their technical skills,” he says. “They’re going to have to start thinking about the broader business, which is something that they haven’t really been pushed to do before. If they want to continue to contribute to the organization, and understand how they fit in, they need to understand how they’re contributing to the economic vitality of the organization.”  With a joint appointment as vice president of business development for the Regenstrief Institute, Saxton has ample opportunity to exercise his own teachings by helping bring research and thought leadership in healthcare data, decision tools and services to clinical practice. Saxton also co-founded the Indiana Chapter of the Society of Physician Entrepreneurs (SoPE) in 2018, with an alumnus of the Business of Medicine program. SoPE is an international not-for-profit that connects healthcare innovators to help build life science venture ecosystems.  Prior to pursuing his Ph.D. in strategy at Indiana University, Saxton was a consultant for Fortune 500 firms. In that role, Saxton helped companies develop their corporate strategies for engaging in acquisitions and alliances that brought more focus to their business. Applying those strategic management tools is an area where Saxton believes hospital systems are playing catch-up with other industries.  “I think right now when hospitals think about differentiation, they think about advertising,” he says. “It’s ‘How do we get more ads on TV?' That is just one piece of marketing and marketing strategy. Every hospital system is chasing every arena that has potential for financial windfalls. They’re all chasing each other with limited dollars within their existing models—not necessarily thinking strategically.”  “As they move to Accountable Care, hospitals and care providers must embrace new engagement practices with patients, new technologies for care coordination, and new business models. All of this requires an open mindset to strategy and innovation from other industries.”  In addition to teaching and research in corporate strategy, Saxton has also been an active member of the Indianapolis venture community. In his role as an advisory board member for a local angel funding group which focuses on investments in the health care industry, Saxton knows there is a lot of interest in the medical community for starting new businesses or being part of new activity. He enjoys connecting the Business of Medicine Physician MBA students to ventures for opportunities to invest, advise or even join founding teams. A number of alumni have used these connections to start their own ventures as well.  “Doctors are very entrepreneurial and very innovative,” says Saxton, a three-time winner of the MBA program’s “Best Professor” award. “But sometimes it’s difficult to have diffusion or adoption of those innovations on a broader scale. People think hospital systems are slow to change and are therefore not at all innovative. The reality is that the individuals within those systems are, in my experience, very innovative. It’s getting others to adopt those innovations and getting them to be more systematic that is the real challenge.” "

In spring of 2021, 36 students from nine schools in Indiana, Ohio, and Michigan presented their analyses to six judges from leading manufacturers with a case focused on “second chance” hiring at a company called Nehemiah Manufacturing.  In 2009, Dan Meyer and Richard Palmer founded Nehemiah Manufacturing to build fast-moving consumer goods brands in Cincinnati, Ohio. Shortly thereafter, Nehemiah hired their first “second-chance” convicted felon, an experiment that has come to define the company. Today, Nehemiah's factory floor, as well as various supervisory and management positions, are staffed by ex-offenders .  [staffed by ex-offenders](https://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/hamilton-county/cincinnati/west-end/nehemiah-manufacturing-west-end-company-gives-felons-second-chance)  Questions the students grappled with included:  • Should Nehemiah grow as fast as its business opportunities, or should it expand only as quickly as it could incorporate second-chancers? • What is the right balance between labor and automation? • Can “second-chance” hiring be replicated in other businesses and communities?  The student team from Wayne State University placed first.   ### Get involved   ### Operations & Supply Chain Management Club  IUPUI’s Operations and Supply Chain Management (OSCM) Club is a great resource to introduce yourself to manufacturing and supply chain operations, meet other undergraduate students who are studying supply chain management, and attend events to network with Indiana’s top manufacturers.

Central to I-Core on the IUPUI campus is a cross-functional, semester-long project in which student teams integrate these disciplines. We invite central Indiana businesses to partner with our student teams to explore new product opportunities. In this partnership, the students will bring fresh perspectives and creative minds, guided by the Kelley IUPUI faculty. The students will benefit from the business partner’s insights and experiences in actual decision-making situations. Each student group works with a business (usually local) to develop a business plan to introduce a new product or service that will meet the needs of their target market while still achieving the objectives of the company and adhering to their policies and values. This includes an analysis of the business, of the target market, customer and business requirements, financial requirements and a final recommendation if the idea should be pursued.  [Read about the power of I-Core](https://blog.kelley.iupui.edu/2017/08/03/innovative-fast-growing-companies-in-central-indiana-get-a-boost-from-kelley-school-students/)  Read more about why you should apply  [Read more about why you should apply](https://blog.kelley.iupui.edu/2016/07/14/kelley-school-of-business-indianapolis-seeks-companies-looking-for-new-growth-opportunities/)   ### Provide real-world experience.  Not only do students learn how to apply classroom theories and skills to a real business situation, but they also learn to work in groups in a way that mirrors actual business and life situations. In a business setting, co-workers at the same level cannot \"fire\" other workers who do not get along or complete quality work. The individual needs to learn how to deal with the situation to achieve stated objectives. The ability to take responsibility for their own work, as well as turn a negative situation into a productive one, is the mark of a true leader. To do this effectively, students learn leadership theories, motivational techniques and conflict resolution. In addition, students spend a significant amount of time focused on intercultural communications, so they learn to work with others from different backgrounds and those who learn, process, communicate and work in different ways.   ## Thank you.

    "body": "  ## Training the next generation of hires through internships.  Launching an internship at your organization is an excellent way to recruit bright new minds and bring new professionals into your company while providing crucial, real-world exposure to students interested in your field.  A well-planned internship program helps you identify potential employees, increase productivity, bring fresh and new ideas to your organization and build community relationships. More importantly, you have the chance to convert interns to full-time employees when they graduate. You'll find plenty of qualified Kelley students eager for the chance to show you their skills.  Kelley Indianapolis Career Services is here to help walk you through the process of creating an internship program for your company.  An estimated 70% of companies offer full-time jobs to their interns.  Survey by Internships.com, as of 2022   ## Internship Guidelines  We follow the internship guidelines below, set by the National Association of Colleges and Employers .  [National Association of Colleges and Employers](http://www.naceweb.org/advocacy/position-statements/united-states-internships.aspx)   ## What is an internship program?  An internship is a form of experiential learning that integrates knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. Internships give students the opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths; and give employers the opportunity to guide and evaluate talent.   ## Define internship standards.  To ensure that an experience, whether it is a traditional internship or one conducted remotely or virtually, is educational and thus eligible to be considered a legitimate internship by the NACE definition, all the following criteria must be met:  If these criteria are followed, it is the opinion of NACE that the experience can be considered a legitimate internship.   ## Posting unpaid internships.  Career services professionals should monitor positions posted through their career centers to see that they follow the NACE definition and criteria articulated in this paper. This is particularly important for unpaid internships, as allowing an unpaid internship to be posted implies approval of the internship. Therefore, career centers should not post any unpaid internships that do not meet the seven criteria set forth above.   ## Academic Credit  While academic credit legitimizes an unpaid experience, in order to be identified as an internship, that experience must fit the criteria. For experiences that employers make available only if academic credit is awarded, the college or university's requirements in combination with the criteria laid out in this paper should be used to determine if the experience is a legitimate internship.   ## Policies & Procedures  Kelley Indianapolis sets internship policy based on the IUPUI Employer Recruiting Policies and Procedures .

    "body": "  ## Manufacturing trends and technology  New challenges and innovations mean the manufacturing landscape is always changing. The Center for Excellence in Manufacturing considers the historic trends that inform our present challenges, and the new ones that will shape our future.  “Second chance” hiring  DEI in Manufacturing  Industry 4.0   ### Is “Second Chance” Hiring Manufacturing’s Best Chance to Employ New Talent?  Recent data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports over 8 million job openings across all industries and regions, including more than 700,000 in the manufacturing sector alone. By the year 2030, the National Association of Manufacturers expects that number to triple to 2.1 million. Include other fields, such as transportation and warehousing, that traditionally partner with and support manufacturing, and that is another 350,000 shorthanded positions somewhere in the supply chain.  Right now it’s likely that the organization you are involved with, as well as most of your suppliers and customers, currently have job openings with relatively few candidates available to help fill those critical vacancies.  There have always been open jobs in manufacturing, but today such understaffed positions typically represent more serious challenges. While Baby Boom workers steadily approach retirement, younger Generation Z workforce entrants resolutely refuse to even consider careers in manufacturing. Automating some of those short-staffed manufacturing tasks with advanced technologies is one possible solution to looming worker shortages. Bidding up wages and wooing workers from other businesses as well as creating apprenticeship programs may similarly yield new workers.  Are there any other viable alternatives?  Nehemiah Manufacturing in Cincinnati, Ohio, represents a refreshingly different option for recruiting production talent. Motivated by compassion and practicality, much of Nehemiah’s workforce consists of “second chance” workers with criminal records. “Many employees who come to Nehemiah Manufacturing just need a chance to prove themselves,” reads their mission. “They may show up with a spotty work history—or no work history—or a record blemished in some way. These hard-to-hire candidates are invisible to most companies. But not to us... we find rare diamonds—some of the hardest working people we’ve ever seen. In proving themselves, these employees become fiercely loyal—insistent on high quality; positive teamers who help each other; hard chargers who self-sacrifice for the success of all.”  [Nehemiah Manufacturing](https://www.nehemiahmfg.com/our-story/)  Is second chance hiring something more manufacturers should consider? While its potential is both vast and exciting, there are many questions from what industries to which jobs it is ideally suited. Stay tuned—this is one avenue of research we at the Kelley School’s Center for Excellence in Manufacturing intend to focus on in the coming years.   ### Diversity, equity, and inclusion in manufacturing  Contrary to the popular imagination, manufacturing is a field that has a history of breakthroughs in diversity, equity and inclusion. From 19th-century inventor Jan Ernst Matzeliger, who revolutionized the making of shoes, to Indiana's own legendary Madam C. J. Walker—the first Black female millionaire in the United States—the industry has its share of trailblazers.  [Jan Ernst Matzeliger,](https://www.invent.org/inductees/jan-ernst-matzeliger)  Today, leaders like Mary Barra , CEO of General Motors, and Rosalind Fox , the factory manager at the Des Moines, Iowa, John Deere plant, are redefining leadership in industries traditionally dominated by white men.  [Mary Barra](https://www.gm.com/our-company/leadership/corporate-officers.html)  [Rosalind Fox](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=58456)  I am a woman who came from the cotton fields of the South. From there I got promoted to the washtub. From there I was promoted to the cook kitchen. And from there I promoted myself into the business of manufacturing hair goods and preparations. I have built my own factory on my own ground.   ### Revolutions in manufacturing  Manufacturers in the United States are in the midst of a revolution—the fourth such transformation to happen in American manufacturing.  While groundbreaking philosophies such as total quality, just-in-time production, and lean manufacturing have steadily transformed the industry, manufacturers today stand on the threshold of their fourth revolution: Industry 4.0.  This new era of manufacturing is paced by powerful, cyber-physical systems and highly-skilled humans to produce incredible new products and services. Manufacturing sectors in both Indiana and the United States as a whole must be preserved and strengthened as we plunge into Industry 4.0. A strong and innovative manufacturing base not only helps to bolster our state and national competitiveness, but also maintains standards of living and reduces trade deficits.   ### History of Industry 4.0   ### The Four Ps of Industry 4.0  The Center for Excellence in Manufacturing has identified four intertwined dimensions of an Industry 4.0 manufacturing strategy: people, products, processes, and performance.   ### People  In contrast to the previous manufacturing revolution, which replaced many people with automated machinery, Industry 4.0 requires highly skilled and educated workers to initiate automation and monitor the machinery behind it. This has led to a wide skills gap in today’s workforce.  In contrast to the previous manufacturing revolution, which replaced many people with automated machinery, Industry 4.0 requires highly skilled and educated workers to initiate automation and monitor the machinery behind it. This has led to a wide skills gap in today’s workforce.   ### Processes  The automated processes we built in the previous revolution have evolved from advanced to routine. There is a need to continue to innovate and improve the levels of automation within today’s manufacturing processes.

    "body": "  ## Associate Professor of Operations and Supply Chain Management   ## Executive Director, IU Business Sustainability and Innovation Lab   ## OneAmerica Foundation Endowed Chair  As he leads physicians in the discussion of operations management, Amrou Awaysheh frequently hears common misconceptions about the field. “Physicians often experience external consultants who come into their hospitals concerned about nitpicky details that take away from the big picture and the value add that operations can bring to healthcare,” says Amrou. “It’s my job to help physicians understand how to break down the processes at their organizations and discover where improvements can help them achieve their goals.” In the Physician MBA Program, Amrou leads the Operations Management course, which introduces physicians to operations management concepts and tools they can use to produce better quality care, lower costs and increase revenue. Ultimately, Amrou says it’s about learning how to create value in your healthcare organization. “I help physicians break down their operations to understand its various elements and where they can compete – whether that’s on cost, quality, responsiveness, or the variety of healthcare services provided,” he says. “Based on where you want to compete and your overall strategy, you can begin crafting an operations strategy. If you set a strategy of being very innovative, you aren’t worried about costs. If you’re a low-cost provider, your goal should be to optimize system to maintain those low costs.”  In addition to instructing MBA students, Amrou is the executive and founding director of the Business Sustainability Lab and a research fellow at the IU Kelley Center for Manufacturing Excellence. His research focuses on how firms leverage and understand data to enhance their operations and supply chains to improve their financial performance. He focuses on business sustainability practices, in which firms can enhance worker welfare or improve their impact on the natural environment. By engaging in these practices, firms improve operations and enhance profitability. Over the last 15 years, Amrou has consulted on over 50 global, corporate social responsibility initiatives with Fortune 500 firms in projects that resulted in savings of over $1.35 billion and revenue increases of over $419 million. Amrou is also familiar with the practicalities in the business of healthcare. His wife, Lina, is a dentist, and Amrou has spent time running clinics and gaining a greater understanding provider responsibilities. “The goal of my course is to give physicians the tools and capabilities to have a seat at the table where decisions are made,” he says. “Our students don’t want to become an operations manager – the MBA equips them to become better healthcare managers and better physician leaders.”  The goal of my course is to give physicians the tools and capabilities to have a seat at the table where decisions are made. The MBA equips them to become better healthcare managers and better physician leaders.  To do this, Amrou immediately puts physicians to work applying operations management lessons from his course into their healthcare organizations.  “From day one, all the assignments in my class are related to physicians’ clinics and practices. What are the processes and operations within your practice? We define and begin understanding the various elements of their own operations so that we may  to truly discuss them as experts,” he says. “I help them become an expert in their own operations so they may view them through a new lens that allows physicians to improve these processes and move the needle toward their goals.”  I help them become an expert in their own operations so they may view them through a new lens that allows physicians to improve processes.  In the past, Amrou’s students have completed projects on redesigning a post-ER visit to specialty clinics process that saved one hospital system over $4 million annually. Another project to increase room capacity in a cardiology clinic increased revenue by $2 million. He says operations can help healthcare organizations create actual value and advance their mission beyond simply a written strategy. “Sometimes, strategy is the easy part. You can say you want to put an astronaut on the moon, or sell a car for $2 or increase patient satisfaction, but operations is where it happens,” says Amrou. “We take the entrepreneurial vision, the CEO’s strategy and the board’s goals and transfer these ideas into something we can actually produce to add value. It’s easy to talk about strategy – operations is where you learn to execute.” "

The knowledge, personal coaching and peer learning you gain from this program will enhance more than your title — it will create an experience unlike any other. We bring together accomplished, talented physicians from across the country and from various specialties to work together. You’ll solve real healthcare problems in a safe environment, led by expert business faculty and one-on-one coaches. You'll learn about the business of healthcare, and you'll discover more about yourself and your potential.   ## 2020 Class Profile  44 Physician Students  15 U.S. States Represented  14 Years on Average Post Residency  44 Years is the Average Age  54 Organizations  35 Specialties   ## How You’ll Learn as an MBA   ### Residency Sessions  Our monthly class sessions allow our physicians to engage with one another and Kelley faculty face-to-face in a rich learning environment in downtown Indianapolis. Residency sessions are an engaging three days of education, as the powerful academics of the Kelley School are partnered with experiential  discussions with your peers and guest speakers.   ### Online Learning  Our flexible learning model means that physicians across the country benefit from earning a physician-only Kelley School of Business MBA. Our on-demand coursework is accessible whenever you have time in your schedule to learn, allowing you to plan your studies around existing professional and personal obligations.   ### Time Commitment  As a busy physician, you need to understand how a rigorous MBA program will fit into your life. Our program is designed with physicians in mind, and it’s led by Kelley faculty members who are pioneers in online learning. The Physician MBA also makes the best use of your time as the lone physician-only MBA program offering continuing medical education (CME) credits.   ## How You’ll Grow as a Leader   ### Executive Coaching  In your second year, you will be partnered with an executive coach who will help you identify your leadership and interpersonal strengths, so you can use your newfound knowledge to meet professional and personal goals. This nine-month partnership is an integral part of your education. It guides reflection on your leadership style and helps you to begin thinking like an executive. You will develop and implement a personalized plan to overcome barriers and achieve your goals.  Meet the coaches   ### Career Advising  This MBA program goes beyond equipping you with the knowledge to lead in the new healthcare landscape; it propels you into a new career. Working one-on-one with a dedicated career coach, you’ll learn how to conduct a professional job search, craft a memorable résumé and elevator pitch, create an effective LinkedIn profile and work with an executive healthcare recruiter to move yourself into an executive position.  Review our career development model   ### Peer Networking  Physicians often tell us that the experience of learning alongside a diverse group of their peers is one of the most valuable takeaways from this MBA program. Our alumni discuss challenges and career opportunities with one another for many years after graduation. Each residency session offers several networking opportunities to connect with one another–and with alumni–through Physician MBA workshops, guest speaker events, Friday night socials and other engagements.

You can create impact through daily operations or in interactions with your suppliers. When you think critically about where your raw materials come from, what you do with your waste and who's involved in your supply chain, you can create value-added change. For example, if you reconsider your firm's waste and find a way to internalize its use, you can close the loop and truly leverage all the opportunities of the circular value chain. Sustainability offers ways to cut costs and increase profitability while still producing an excellent product.

    "body": "  ## Find your voice in healthcare policy.  The Kelley Physician MBA is the only MBA program that leads a physician-only cohort on an immersive trip to Washington, D.C. The Healthcare Policy Experience course is a lesson in policy told through the lens of healthcare providers specifically.  You’ll learn about healthcare policy directly from the policy makers and regulators: how public policies are developed and which policy trends affect your practice. With a deeper understanding of the process, you learn how to navigate the regulatory environment and how to have a voice in policy that affects your organization.   ## Watch the course in action.   ## How it Works   ### Travel    Students travel to the nation’s capital for a five-day course to learn firsthand about healthcare reform and public policy through candid discussions with policy makers, lobbyists, regulators and government officials. This course gives you a seat at the table to analyze emerging healthcare policy and grasp how it affects you.   ### Analyze    Students keep a daily journal reflecting on the intellectual insights of each day and how they relate to course readings, discussions and speakers. This creates a long-term reference guide for staying abreast of the healthcare policy process. Become a better manager, leader and citizen by learning how to advance your objectives in the context of an ever-changing governmental and political landscape.   ## The Washington Campus  While in Washington, D.C., home base for the trip is at the Washington Campus , a non-profit, non-partisan, higher education consortium of business schools and universities. Physicians will meet with Washington insiders here and, following visits to government sites throughout the city, will regroup here for class discussions with the Kelley instructor. Students learn how to ethically and effectively create public policy change.  [Washington Campus](http://www.washcampus.edu/index.php?submenu=Consortium&src)   ## The Student Experience  Hear from physician students about what they gained from participating in the Healthcare Policy Experience in the Kelley Physician MBA Program.   ### Mary Pell Abernathy, MD, MBA’18  Kelley’s exclusive physician-only course in Washington, D.C., empowered Mary Pell Abernathy, MD, MBA’18, to become a physician advocate.

Through this course, I learned that’s only the beginning. We physicians can have a voice in shaping the law.  This opportunity helps our physicians understand where policy can be improved and the steps they can take to assure the physician voice is included in the process. "

The international consulting course gives Evening MBA students an action-based learning opportunity to travel to and consult with a business in an emerging economy. Kelley partners with local universities and businesses for this 3-credit-hour course to help students gain literacy of best business practices to employ while solving a business problem for local entrepreneurs . This course also challenges students to consider business models other than those they may have experienced in the U.S.  [solving a business problem for local entrepreneurs](https://blog.kelley.iupui.edu/2021/06/16/a-pivotal-moment-capstone-course-gives-evening-mba-students-real-world-experiences-abroad/)   ### How it works.  Class meetings are held prior to the trip to prepare students for understanding the emerging market destination and the consulting process. Students then meet online with business clients to learn their clients' business models and understand the objectives of the consulting project. Student teams develop a consulting plan, conduct research and develop recommendations. During the last week of the class, teams travel to the destination country and work with the client to finalize the recommendations and help implement the plan.   #### 1. Consulting  Students are connected online with entrepreneurs to work on solving a business problem during the 11-week quarter.   #### 2.

    "body": "  ## Build a pipeline of qualified candidates ready to fill your open positions.  The average cost-per-hire in the United States is $4,129, according to the Society for Human Resource Management. As a large company, you understand how these hiring costs can truly add up. You’re positioned in a competitive market where you must identify top talent and market your opportunities and culture while many other firms vie for the same candidates’ interest.  The Kelley School Headquarters of Urban Business (HUB) can work with you to build brand awareness early among potential candidates and keep them engaged with your firm throughout their college careers.   ### How Kelley HUB Can Help  By developing a customized talent pipeline to fit the needs of your company, you gain access to candidates early, which can prevent just-in-time hiring. We work with you to engage students from high school through graduate school so you may access top business talent well before graduation.  The Kelley HUB helps you address and overcome the unique hiring challenges of a large company, such as:   ## The Benefit of a Talent Pipeline   ### Identify Developing Talent Early  When you don’t have to rush to fill an open position, you have time to identify promising prospects who are still developing. Over time, you build a relationship and interest when other firms weren’t interested in these students. Once the developing talent finally reaches the required skill or experience level your open position requires, you may formally recruit them.   ### Increase Hiring Manager Satisfaction  The rush of typical panic-sourcing your talent often leads to some candidates who aren't good fits. When you eliminate this rush and have more time to vet your candidates, the pipeline process delivers higher-quality candidates and fewer disinterested or unqualified candidates. Hiring managers can avoid wasting time working with poorly matched candidates. When combined with your improved quality of hires, the pipeline dramatically increases hiring manager satisfaction throughout the recruiting process.   ### Boost Offer Acceptance Rates  Students in your recruiter’s inventory have more time to learn about and appreciate your company, which increases the chance they’ll want to join your team. This two-way communication over several years also allows your firm to capture and understand the unique needs of the candidates you’re targeting. As a result, you can sculpt your offers to meet those unique needs. Taken together, the pipeline process can dramatically increase your offer acceptance rates from those students who were in the inventory.   ## Solutions at Kelley HUB  The Kelley HUB offers specific programs to help large businesses build a talent pipeline that attracts and trains qualified candidates for the positions you want to grow.   ## Let’s talk talent.  We want to discuss the opportunity to partner with you in the new HUB career services model. Please contact us to learn more about how we can get started.   ### Robert Smith  Associate Director of Employer Services, Kelley Indianapolis Career Services rs26@iupui.edu 317-274-2587 "

The Commercial Real Estate Workshop goes beyond academic case studies—you will work in groups to create real-world solutions for actual real estate deals using what you learn in the co-major courses.   #### This capstone experience enhances your cross-functional skill set in:   #### Example workshop projects:  The Commercial Real Estate Workshop, BUS-R428 (1.5 credits), must be taken twice: once in the fall, and once in the spring, in whichever order best fits your schedule.   ## Fast-track your resume to industry recruiters  The Commercial Real Estate Workshop also provides an opportunity for you to network closely with industry professionals and gain greater exposure among potential employers. Faculty submit workshop students’ resumes to recruiters and IU Center for Real Estate Studies Advisory Board members in the real estate field.  [IU Center for Real Estate Studies](https://kelley.iu.edu/faculty-research/centers-institutes/real-estate/index.html)   ## How to make real estate a second major  The co-major can be paired with any of the six Kelley business majors we offer. Once you’ve been admitted to the Kelley School, choose your major, and follow the degree path for your Bachelor of Science in Business. Next, inform your advisor that you want to add the Real Estate co-major, which consists of 15 credit hours. Your advisor will help you with the details and course requirements.  The Commercial Real Estate Workshop was hands down the most beneficial class I took at IUPUI in terms of preparing me for a career in commercial real estate. The weekly cases are great examples of what it is like to work on a project within your career. It’s the closest thing you can get to real-world experience in a class. It’s also an excellent way to network with some of Indiana’s top commercial real estate companies.  The Commercial Real Estate Workshop gave me the confidence to get into a new career that I have an absolute love and passion for. This program is so much more than just a class; it’s truly a first step into a new future.   ## Co-Major Faculty   ### Sara Heidtmann Coers  Associate Director, IU Center for Real Estate Studies and Lecturer in Real Estate  View Sara's profile  [View Sara's profile](https://kelley.iu.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/profile.html?id=SHEIDTMA)   ### Co-major or workshop questions?

[Student Central](https://studentcentral.iupui.edu/funding/index.html)   ### Is there a minimum work requirement to apply to the Evening MBA Program?   ### Should I take particular courses to prepare for the Evening MBA Program?  No. Our program has no prerequisites. If accepted into the program, you will be required to take an accounting primer (a short online course in basic accounting principles) after acceptance but before taking your first accounting course. Accepted students who are licensed CPAs may be exempt from taking the primer. Please contact the program office at mbaindy@iupui.edu for more information.   ### I am enrolled in another MBA program. Can I transfer credit into the Kelley Evening MBA Program?  The Evening MBA Program requires that 48 of the 54 credit hours be taken in residence at the Kelley School of Business. If you have been enrolled in a previous graduate business program, you may petition to transfer up to 6 hours of credit, provided it meets certain criteria and has the approval of the Evening MBA Program faculty chair.   ### Is it possible to become an Indiana resident after starting the Kelley Evening MBA Program?  The Office of the Registrar determines Indiana residency . Typically, a student must be a resident of the state for 12 months, working full-time and not simply residing here for tuition purposes.  [Indiana residency](https://studentcentral.iupui.edu/personal-information/residency.html)   ### I have an international visa. Can I study in the Evening MBA Program?  It depends on the type of visa you hold. We can accept many types of visas. However, we cannot accept F1 or J1 visas. Holders of these visas must be enrolled in school full time, while the Evening MBA is a part-time program of study. F1 or J1 visa holders may contact our colleagues on the Indiana University Bloomington campus regarding admission to the Kelley Full-time MBA Program: iumba@indiana.edu .   ### I completed my application. When will I find out if I’m accepted?  After we’ve received all your application materials and if the Evening MBA Admissions Committee feels you are a viable candidate, we’ll notify you within 10 business days that you’ve been selected for an admissions interview. After the interview, we’ll notify you within seven business days if you’ve been admitted.   ### How long does the Evening MBA take to complete?  24 months. It is a part-time MBA program designed to be completed while you work full time (or while you pursue another graduate degree as part of an approved dual degree program).   ### What does the class schedule look like?  You'll typically have class twice a week: one night per week on campus and one night per week online. Our students enjoy this \"hybrid model\" because it allows them to build face-to-face relationships with professors and peers while affording them the flexibility of online learning.  Most Evening MBA classes meet 6:00-9:00 p.m., approximately.   ### May I just take an Evening MBA course or two?  No. We do not accept non-degree-seeking students. Anyone wanting to take Evening MBA classes must apply and be admitted into the full degree program.   ### I’m not sure that the Evening MBA fits into my schedule. How flexible is your coursework?  The Evening MBA uses a cohort structure. Twice a year in August and November, we admit a cohort of 50–70 new students, ambitious professionals who take the same core classes together at the same time. Our students tell us they frequently learn as much from other students as from their professors; this peer learning model is integral to the program.  For this reason, we strongly discourage you from applying to or enrolling in the program unless you’re prepared to complete the coursework schedule as planned for the full 24 months. Our curriculum and schedule require your commitment — but we promise it’ll be worth it.  Of course, we understand that life happens. If your circumstances change after beginning the program, and it’s no longer possible for you to complete the coursework as scheduled, we’ll work with you. However, prospective students should not enter the program with this expectation of flexibility. "

    "body": "  ## Executive Associate Dean and Chief Operating Officer, Professor, and Fairbanks Endowed Chair at the IU Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health  Nir Menachemi has spent his career living at the intersection of healthcare and business.  “What interested me as I created my research career were issues that presented both clinical and managerial challenges. For example, issues like improving quality, reducing medical errors, or adopting information technology. Each of these topics has clinical and business implications in healthcare organizations,” explains Menachemi, who is a professor of health policy and management.  Now the Executive Associate Dean and Chief Operating Officer at the Indiana University Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health, Menachemi says innate in his training is content from both healthcare and business faculty.  Tomorrow’s physician leader is going to have to be fluent in both business and medicine to be truly effective.  Menachemi received his doctorate in health services administration from the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Before coming to IU, he held faculty positions at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Public Health and the Florida State University College of Medicine.  “All of my research looks at either organizational or policy aspects associated with changes to clinical structures or to innovation adoption. It’s very apropos to both the clinical and business sides of healthcare,” Menachemi says.  An understanding of revenue and delivery models in healthcare is a pre-requisite of almost every study he conducts, he explains.  In the Business of Medicine Physician MBA Program, one of the courses Menachemi teaches—Anatomy & Physiology of the U.S. Healthcare System—is an overview of the many different ways the industry has developed models for financing healthcare over the years.  “This is a course that provides a big picture understanding: how all the things physicians experience every single day are related to each other. There are cost containment pressures; there is a focus on improving quality, and there are all these hospital report cards that are being published. Without seeing the 50,000-foot view, it’s hard to appreciate how and why all these things are getting us (the U.S. healthcare system) toward something better.”    This is a course that provides a big picture understanding: how all the things physicians experience every single day are related to each other.  In the Global Healthcare Experience course, Menachemi has accompanied students on trips to Cuba, Singapore, Malaysia, Switzerland and the Netherlands. He says visiting another country to dissect its healthcare system, evaluate their solutions and translate those lessons to the United States provides an excellent learning opportunity for physicians.  “There’s no substitute for on-the-ground experience. You can read all you want about the healthcare system of a given country, but learning doesn’t happen until you’re immersing yourself in that knowledge by talking to hospital CEOs, interacting with physicians and learning about their challenges from the perspectives of these different stakeholders,” he says.  Menachemi also teaches The Role of Health IT in Medicine: Past, Present & Future, a course that familiarizes students with current issues associated with health information technology and its impact on the U.S. healthcare system. Health IT applications (e.g., electronic health records, decision support systems, health information exchanges) are playing an increasingly important role in patient safety and accountable care, and they are now linked to financial reimbursements.  “We need to apply more of those technologies to improve clinical care, not just the business aspect of it,” he says. “Health IT, in its current state in this country, bridges the clinical and business sides of healthcare, which is why I think it’s a very exciting course to have in the Kelley Physician MBA program.”  “Tomorrow’s physician leader is going to have to be fluent in both business and medicine to be truly effective,” Menachemi adds.

    "body": "  ## Chairperson, Graduate Business Programs in Medicine   ## Clinical Associate Professor of Marketing  Healthcare consumer behavior intrigues Stovall because of the necessity of medical care in our lives. His research into consumer behavior, digital marketing and sociocultural influences on consumption behavior provide insights into how patients consume healthcare messaging and how to influence healthy behavior.  “Physicians want to create change – they’re the ones who see the problems on the ground level and understand that status quo may not be the best way forward,” says Stovall. “Once we are open to new ways of doing things, we can develop innovative solutions. For physician leaders, this may be understanding how to convince hospital administrators to approach a clinical challenge from a new angle.”  Stovall feels the opportunities to use marketing to improve healthy behaviors are far-reaching. His research in digital marketing and healthcare consumer behaviors suggest physician MBAs have a critical role to play by pairing their clinical expertise with innovative marketing ideas.  “Marketing allows you to be creative, to think outside the box and try new things and determine which new idea works,” he says. “Can wearing a smartwatch help your patient remember to take her medicine? In the long run, it might be a sound investment in the technology, but bouncing ideas like this off each other in class can help you think creatively about exploring new options.”  It’s that discussion and experimentation that Stovall enjoys most in teaching physicians in the Business of Medicine MBA Program. Because physicians bring to the classroom a wealth of knowledge and experience, Stovall feels his role is to introduce new ideas and support physicians as they mold the concepts to solve their own challenges.  “Our physician students are the ones implementing change; I’m simply the tour guide on their journey through healthcare marketing,” he says. “We discuss successful marketing approaches and they can share how this idea could benefit their organizations. Sharing current challenges and solutions in a room of diverse physicians from various specialties and geographies ignites new ideas and new approaches. It’s very exciting to see them take these lessons and apply them in real time.” "

    "body": "  ## About the I-Core Project  A partner company will be assigned to an I-Core class. The class will have 5-12 student teams, with 5-6 students on each team. The teams will analyze the company’s current business situation and develop recommendations for new products or services. Each team will provide the company with an analysis of its recommendation. This analysis will address the marketing, operations, and financial aspects of the recommendation. We limit the number of teams working on the same idea to two, if necessary.  Prior to the start of each semester, the I-Core faculty will meet with each company to establish the parameters of the project. During the semester, students work closely with the company in conjunction with their classroom work. At the conclusion of the semester, each team will make an oral presentation of their findings and recommendations to a panel of the company’s managers and the I-Core faculty.   ### Requirements   ### What your company can expect from Kelley   ### What the teams will need from your company   ### Process   ### Company requirements   ### FAQs   ### Can the groups investigate a project we are thinking about?  This is the most common question and the one we struggle with the most. We have a couple of ways of handling this. If it is a larger class (the vast majority), then having all the teams look at one idea is not feasible. If you have four or five ideas in mind, and they meet the academic requirements of the project, we might be able to let groups pick which one they’d like to do. What is most common is that the faculty and the company representatives determine some workable ideas beforehand and ‘feed’ them to any groups struggling to come up with ideas.   ### How much will this cost us?  There are no costs, only time.   ### How many of the project ideas typically turn out to be worthwhile for our company to pursue?  None. What is most common is that \"nuggets\" of ideas appear to the company representative. These nuggets might be related around a new product, possible promotional idea, a new market, etc. These students are juniors and just really starting to take business classes. You get fresh, but very inexperienced, eyes.   ### What benefit do we receive?   ### What type of industry works best?  We can, and have, worked with a wide variety of industries. Companies that sell tangible products or companies that offer services that require investment (i.e. significant materials, facilities, etc.) are the best for this project. Service companies that do not need investment may require our student groups to use fabricated parameters in order to meet the educational objectives of I-Core. For example, we might require them to purchase a truck or lease a building even though one is not needed. Tech companies that are all digital are more difficult. We are willing to work with any industry, but we might have to get creative regarding how we fit it within our requirements.   ### Ready to partner with us? "

    "body": "  ## Professor of Finance   ## Kelley Venture Fellow  When physicians gain a greater understanding of financial management, they are able to both understand and influence the financial direction of their organizations. This is the goal behind finance courses taught by Ken Carow in the Physician MBA Program at the Kelley School of Business.  “An MBA allows physicians to understand why various decisions are being made at their companies,” he said. “It allows you to understand your company and also allows you to understand how to speak in the language of those in healthcare administration. If you can’t speak that language, you’re less likely to accomplish your goals. This degree helps you add value to your organization.”  Carow holds a chartered financial analysis (CFA) designation and a PhD, bringing both academic and professional experience to the classroom. His research primarily focuses on financial institutions and capital structure, and he serves on the board of Fortune 500 company Thrivent Financial.  “I have the opportunity to see how financial decisions play out in large companies with unique structures, such as non-for-profits,” he said. “This certainly highlights the differences between for-profit and non-for-profit companies. In the medical field there are many hospitals that fall within both categories, so understanding those differentials is important to anyone in healthcare management.”  Understanding how the capital structure and organizational structure interrelate with each other helps physician leaders understand the capital decisions being made at their companies and prepare them to influence those top-level decisions.  In the financial management course, Carow instructs physicians on how to provide insight into the time value of money and then moves into how to make decisions about new projects that an organization may take on, and how to evaluate those projects.  “Most physicians will be confronted with the decision to purchase something to either replace or expand their facilities’ offerings. With technology changing as rapidly as it is today, there’s always a decision to make regarding how long you should keep a new piece of equipment, when to replace it and understanding the economies of scale that affect the organization,” he said. “All these factors play into decisions that physician leaders will make. If they don’t know how to communicate these concepts from a financial perspective, it’s less likely that their project will be embraced by the organization and administration. Physicians will also learn how to identify projects that don’t add value to the organization and should be avoided.”  Carow’s financial management course also explores the strategy of the healthcare organization and how that approach affects the financials. This helps inform leaders on the financial health of the company as they make ongoing decisions about borrowing capital, using equity and how to make decisions such as expansions.  “Understanding how the capital structure and organizational structure interrelate with each other helps physician leaders understand the capital decisions being made at their companies and prepare them to influence those top-level decisions,” he said.  Understandably, finance may not be an area in which physician MBA students have had a great deal of experience. Carow acknowledges that these may be new concepts, and he approaches these lessons by having students work through a problem, discuss as a group and answer any questions that arise. Having taught MBAs for over twenty-five years, Carow says it is enjoyable to teach physicians.  “These physicians bring to the classroom a wealth of knowledge regarding the healthcare industry and their roles as physicians. Many are very involved in the managerial decisions being made at their organizations,” he said. “Because of this, we enjoy very robust conversations about the industry and about the role of finance in their careers. They often use these lessons for direct and immediate application in their organizations.” "

Yes, all classes and other exercises are completely online—allowing you to complete this healthcare management certificate from any location in the world. Live online classes meet biweekly on Wednesdays, 6-8:40 p.m. ET. Although your classes meet online only six times each quarter, homework and other assignments are due each week (even when class does not meet). This approach is one of the most flexible among healthcare management degrees online.   ### How much time do I need to dedicate each week?  Students tell us they need to invest 3 to 5 hours per week to master the material and complete their assignments. We expect you to dedicate this much time every week, even though classes only meet online every other week.   ### How often do classes meet?  Synchronous classes meet online every other week in each of four 12-week quarters. Class sessions are 2.5 hours long—held 6-8:40 p.m. ET with a 10-minute break. Typically, classes meet in weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11, and students are expected to be present. On the even weeks, classes will not meet live, but you will still have assignments to complete.   ### How many credits is the program?  Considered a mini-MBA, the Graduate Certificate in Medical Management consists of five 3-credit hour courses for a total of 15 credit hours.   ### Do my credits transfer to an MBA program?  Kelley offers two ways to transfer your graduate certificate credit hours to a Kelley MBA program. For those in central Indiana, all 15 credit hours can be transferred into the Kelley Evening MBA , a hybrid program that combines online and in-person education. You need to be able to attend classes in person on the IUPUI campus in downtown Indianapolis. Students interested in the Evening MBA should apply in summer for acceptance in the winter cohort, which starts in early November. Students outside of the Indianapolis area can transfer 12 credit hours into the Kelley Executive Degree Program MBA . Students can apply for any quarter after completing the Graduate Certificate in Medical Management. More information about how to apply to these MBA programs is made available directly to graduate certificate students.

    "body": "  ## Apply what you've learned with your peers.  One weekend per month, you will engage with your physician peers and business professors face-to-face in downtown Indianapolis. These residency sessions are a unique feature of this program and reveal the best Kelley has to offer—peer learning, award-winning instruction, intense professional development, industry guest speakers, professional networking, team building and innovative healthcare and business knowledge. Through intense immersion experiences, you will try out new ideas, learn new ways of thinking, enhance your communication and problem-solving skills and refine leadership and team collaboration capabilities.   ## How it works.  Our residency sessions are held on Friday from 8 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. and Saturday from 7:45 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. in downtown Indianapolis, Indiana. One of the country’s largest cities and a global convention destination, Indianapolis offers easy and direct travel with a world-class airport and exceptional hotel accommodations within walking distance of the executive classroom suite, which is located just 20 minutes from the airport.  Indianapolis International Airport was recognized for Best Airport in North America by Airports Council International and Best Airport in America by readers of Condé Nast Traveler.  Kelley's Business of Medicine residency sessions make the most of your time on campus with an immersive experience that includes everything from group problem solving to guest speakers, \"live\" case studies and a lecture series. The in-person residency sessions will tie together all of your coursework in powerful meetings that help you explore your interests within the business of medicine. This is the only physician MBA program offering CME credits. So while you’re in the classroom learning, you’re also earning 1 hour of AMA PRA Category 1 Credits™ (recognized by AOA as Category 1-B) for every hour spent in residency.   ## Sample Residency Weekend  Between residency weekends, you study 10-14 hours per week, which includes time spent collaborating on team projects by phone, email, and online. A sample of a residency weekend includes:   ## Friday  Friday morning coffee with classmates once you arrive on campus is followed by a discussion on financial statements. Grab lunch in the executive dining room while listening to an executive leader discuss healthcare systems engineering. Afternoon sessions cover healthcare pricing and a Friday evening lecture features a prominent healthcare industry leader.   ## Saturday  Saturday breakfast with your team is followed by a discussion on using the concepts of time value money to value a company, project or asset. Lunch in the executive dining room gives you the chance to catch up with other students or chat with a faculty member. An early afternoon course reviews and analyzes healthcare delivery innovation and information that decision makers use to assess viability. You’ll head home by 4:15 p.m.  At first, it was a bit daunting to travel to Indianapolis one weekend a month, but after talking to people doing online MBAs, the Kelley MBA program takes physician learning to a whole different level. The camaraderie built during our time together, the rich discussions that happen in the classroom every single residency weekend, the friendships we develop and the networking that results are invaluable. I can’t imagine doing it any other way. "

    "body": "  ## The Concept of Sustainability and Why it Matters in Business  Sustainability does not need to be an abstract idea; ultimately, it is achievable in every type of business. Whether your firm is building widgets or providing services like legal advice, you deploy processes to achieve your goals. Within your processes are inputs (paper, water, steel beams) and outputs (a legal brief, a widget) that ultimately lead you to create value for your customers. Through the processing of your raw goods into final products, there are opportunities for sustainability and, thus, efficiency and savings.   ## A Global Focus on Sustainability  The United Nations adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015 as part of its 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Among these urgent calls to action are goals encouraging sustainable practices, many of which have been adopted by global companies to map their own strategic priorities. Below are the UN SDGs directly related to sustainable practices.  [17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)](https://sdgs.un.org/goals)   ### Clean Water and Sanitation  Learn about sustainable water management .  Learn about sustainable water management .

[Learn about sustainable production patterns](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal12)   ## Sustainability that Works  Once you’ve gained a sustainability mindset, you are able to view energy costs and savings through a new lens. Much like a child who grows up to understand why her parents always turned off lights in unoccupied rooms, a business leader who recognizes the savings that come from efficient use of resources is able to save money and greater competitive edge.  In addition to using fewer resources and improving the costs per unit or service created, a firm that is able to streamline operations can also tout its sustainable practices to a growing consumer base that wants to support such organizations. This is the kind of sustainable mindset that sells.   ## Opportunities in Sustainability within Operations   ### Inputs  Instead of buying coal or grid electricity for your firm’s energy, could you make your own through investment in solar panels? Unilever's zero waste initiative has helped achieve €220 million of cost savings and created more than 1,000 jobs at hundreds of factories across the globe.

If one of your locations produces a good or service twice as efficiently as 10 other locations, identifying and repeating the efficient practice across all locations can multiply the impact of this sustainable practice.   ## Where do you begin?  Sustainable practices create value for more than just your stockholders; these steps create value for all your stakeholders , including employees, your local community and our planet.

    "body": "  ## A Fresh Physician Network  Each year, the Kelley School of Business Physician MBA enrolls new students from across the country. Cohorts include physicians from diverse specialties, practice environments, cultural backgrounds and healthcare delivery models. Through careful selection of student candidates, our program ensures rich conversation and a variety of peer learning opportunities that our students often regard as one of the greatest benefits of the MBA experience. Not only do you learn alongside your own class of students, you connect with other Physician MBA cohorts and alumni, expanding your physician network to hundreds of healthcare leaders.   ### The Physician Learning Style    To increase long-term knowledge retention for practicing physicians earning CME credits, studies have shown it’s important to understand the physician learning style. This circular learning model follows these steps:  Kelley professors innately understand this learning style, which is at the center of this program’s delivery model. Physicians first learn material online, reconciling new information with what they already know. When they arrive in Indianapolis for monthly residency sessions , physicians apply what they’ve learned alongside their peers, enriching the conversation with diverse viewpoints and experiences. At the end of the weekend, physicians return home to their practices reflecting on what they’ve learned before starting the next learning module.   ### Learning together.    Peer learning is so central to the Physician MBA Program that group work and connection with other students is embedded in the class structure. Each physician is assigned to a team of five students, specifically chosen to work together for six months. By working alongside peers to complete team projects, physicians improve their capabilities in collaboration and leadership. As they rotate through the roles of presenter, data researcher, analyst and presentation preparer, physicians strengthen their ability to lead, listen and contribute in new ways.  Each six months throughout the program, these teams will change, affording students the opportunity to build new leadership skills, expand their networks and gain new sounding boards among their peers. By the end of this program, physicians graduate with not only an MBA but also lifelong friendships and a strong peer support network. "

Indiana University's Kelley School of Business is an internationally renowned school that is consistently placed at the top of accredited ranking systems. One attribute cited for this high ranking is Kelley's Integrated Core (I-Core)—the cornerstone of Kelley's undergraduate program.  Learn about the requirements and apply  Current partner? Find more information  I-Core consists of junior-level, undergraduate students studying marketing, finance, operations and supply chain management, and team dynamics and leadership in a block unit. Central to I-Core on the IUPUI campus is a cross-functional, semester-long project in which student teams integrate these disciplines. We invite central Indiana businesses to partner with our student teams to explore new product opportunities. In this partnership, the students will bring fresh perspectives and creative minds, guided by the Kelley IUPUI faculty. The students will benefit from the business partner’s insights and experiences in actual decision-making situations. Each student group works with a business (usually local) to develop a business plan to introduce a new product or service that will meet the needs of their target market while still achieving the objectives of the company and adhering to their policies and values. This includes an analysis of the business, of the target market, customer and business requirements, financial requirements and a final recommendation if the idea should be pursued.  [Read about the power of I-Core](https://blog.kelley.iupui.edu/2017/08/03/innovative-fast-growing-companies-in-central-indiana-get-a-boost-from-kelley-school-students/)  Read more about why you should apply  [Read more about why you should apply](https://blog.kelley.iupui.edu/2016/07/14/kelley-school-of-business-indianapolis-seeks-companies-looking-for-new-growth-opportunities/)   ### Provide real-world experience.  Not only do students learn how to apply classroom theories and skills to a real business situation, but they also learn to work in groups in a way that mirrors actual business and life situations. In a business setting, co-workers at the same level cannot \"fire\" other workers who do not get along or complete quality work. The individual needs to learn how to deal with the situation to achieve stated objectives. The ability to take responsibility for their own work, as well as turn a negative situation into a productive one, is the mark of a true leader. To do this effectively, students learn leadership theories, motivational techniques and conflict resolution. In addition, students spend a significant amount of time focused on intercultural communications, so they learn to work with others from different backgrounds and those who learn, process, communicate and work in different ways.   ## Thank you.  Our partners, including the companies listed below, add value to our program and provide great opportunity for Kelley students. "

This course also challenges students to consider business models other than those they may have experienced in the U.S.  [solving a business problem for local entrepreneurs](https://blog.kelley.iupui.edu/2021/06/16/a-pivotal-moment-capstone-course-gives-evening-mba-students-real-world-experiences-abroad/)   ### How it works.  Class meetings are held prior to the trip to prepare students for understanding the emerging market destination and the consulting process. Students then meet online with business clients to learn their clients' business models and understand the objectives of the consulting project. Student teams develop a consulting plan, conduct research and develop recommendations. During the last week of the class, teams travel to the destination country and work with the client to finalize the recommendations and help implement the plan.   #### 1. Consulting  Students are connected online with entrepreneurs to work on solving a business problem during the 11-week quarter.   #### 2. Emerging Markets  Students travel to the destination during the summer quarter for a week-long consulting experience.   #### 3. Real-World Solutions  While in the host country, students spend each day at the business working with the clients to finalize recommendations and implement solutions.   ### Emerging Markets Course in Chile  Kelley Evening MBA students traveled to Chile to work as consultants with several small businesses. While there, Chilean company Cine 1 created this video to showcase the experience with Evening MBA students.   ### MBA Consulting Work in Chile  Kelley Evening MBA students share how they applied what they learned in the classroom to help small business owners in Santiago, Chile.

[Read more](https://blog.kelley.iupui.edu/2021/06/16/a-pivotal-moment-capstone-course-gives-evening-mba-students-real-world-experiences-abroad/)  This course has been the most memorable teaching experience of my career. From meeting entrepreneurs in a different country and learning about their amazing businesses to watching students create high-quality solutions on the projects, I'm fortunate to be part of this transformative experience.  It's not enough to learn accounting and finance alone. You need to learn how those individual tools are applicable to various companies. Not everything is a cookie-cutter answer, and sometimes, you have to think outside the box to implement the change you want. "

    "body": "  ## Professor of Accounting Roger and Barbara Schmenner Faculty Fellow  “As I delve into the study of healthcare accounting, I am intrigued to learn why a box of gauze can cost a hospital an exorbitant price compared to the local drugstore,” says J. Reed Smith. “I want to understand real healthcare costs from a patient’s perspective.”  A Fulbright Scholar, Smith is one of just a handful of professors in the country tackling the theoretical issues of accounting through modeling. His research focuses primarily on studying the economics of fraud and auditing and investigating connections between the two. Because data on fraud is proprietary and often very difficult to find, Smith uses modeling—the use of assumptions and sets of mathematical equations—to better understand, and sometimes predict, how and why fraud happens.  “Success is writing up a model that’s both institutionally rich and intellectually honest,” Smith explains. “It’s about being able to capture and formalize interesting observations that we haven’t seen before.”  Research is the way we stay on the leading edge, to consistently challenge everything we know.  The same manner of modeling offers insight into contract modeling and the collaboration required for healthcare alliances. The work offers some practical insights for auditors and, just as important for Smith, enriches his teaching.  “Research is the way we stay on the leading edge, to consistently challenge everything we know,” says Smith. “I believe it’s important for faculty to promote research as a way of enriching the learning process.” "

Four learning modules comprising six credit hours help you develop the skills, knowledge and understanding that facilitate career growth now and in the future. These modules help you:   ### Executive Skills Learning Modules  Your executive skills curriculum is structured in four modules.   ## Module 1: Executive Management Orientation  Your Evening MBA experience begins with the Executive Management Orientation (1.5 credit hours) prior to the start of formal classes. You'll be immersed in a live business case ; receive classroom exposure to fundamental business principles in microeconomics, strategy and general business acumen and complete career reflection exercises. This module lays the groundwork for your career management plan and your executive skill development throughout the Evening MBA Program.  [You'll be immersed in a live business case](https://blog.kelley.iupui.edu/2021/04/20/evening-mba-students-start-program-by-solving-pandemic-problem-for-local-brewery/)   ## Module 2 : Seminar in Management Issues  Spend a weekend running a simulated company. Receive and provide feedback with your classmates as you develop an action plan for your future . The Seminar in Management Issues (1.5 credit hours) is a popular experience for many Evening MBA students, as the X511 course and weekend simulation put students in the hot seat to run a company, manage challenges and receive high-quality feedback.

To provide greater flexibility around your busy schedule and other required classes, the Executive Skills electives are offered throughout the year at non-traditional times, such as weekends, around holiday breaks and online.  Through the management simulation, I learned that people saw me as someone in charge. It was a quality I didn’t realize I had. I couldn’t grow something I didn’t recognize, and this experience opened my eyes and built my confidence about who I can be and the impact I can have on an organization .

    "body": "  ## Clinical Assistant Professor of Management and Entrepreneurship  Walter is teaching the “Leading Organizational Change” course in the Physician MBA. An engineer with an MBA focused in finance and accounting, Walter became fascinated by effective leadership while working at Eli Lilly and Company.  “The leaders were able to bring out the best in both individuals and teams,” she said.  Walter went on to earn a PhD in organizational behavior specifically related to leadership because she not only wanted to understand exceptional leadership, but she wanted to teach it, too. Her research focuses on leadership development — the thought process that goes into creating leaders and how leaders seek and use feedback to improve.  Walter recognizes that the soft skills of leadership don’t always come easily to people with logic-based professions.  “I have an engineering and finance background. Like physicians, we aren’t taught management skills; we’re taught technical skills: how to engineer a well, how to balance a budget or how to perform surgery. But when it comes to managing people and understanding their motivations, we aren’t trained on that,” she says. “Leading is understanding not only how you tick, but how other people operate — their strengths and weaknesses — and working within their capabilities.”  Recognizing when change is needed is only step one, says Walter. Change management involves preemptively considering all the steps needed to achieve transformation and any obstacles that may stand in your way. Many people have ideas for improving processes in healthcare, but not all of them are successful.  “Most people who haven’t been trained in change management don’t understand why their plans failed. It’s often due to unexpected roadblocks,” Walter explained. “One of the things this change management course does is train you to anticipate potential hurdles and create strategies for getting around them so they do not derail your plans.”  The complex American healthcare system is rife with opportunity for improvement and organizational change. Physicians are uniquely suited to lead this transformation due to their roles and deep understanding of the medical system. Equipping physicians to lead change means preparing them to gain buy-in from their colleagues rather than dictating top-down orders. By gaining skills in organizational change, Walter says physicians can get everyone on board with their ideas for change in a way that will be successful for the entire organization.  “Some people are good at implementing a plan. Others are better at articulating direction. A good leader meets both those groups where they are because we must have all types on the team. We need visionaries, we need some naysayers to ensure it’s done right, and we need in-the-weeds people following through on details,” says Walter. “Physician leaders need buy-in from all of these team members because you can’t do it alone. We empower physicians to successfully lead the change they know needs to happen.” "

    "body": "  ## Our curriculum  As an undergraduate, you’ll learn all of the fundamentals of supply chain management—from daily operating and decision-making practices to the challenges of logistics and distribution.   ### Undergraduate manufacturing courses at IUPUI   #### BUS-P 200 Foundations of Operations & Supply Chain Management  This course is designed to introduce the student to the basic ideas and concepts that make up the field of operations and supply chain management and to prepare the student to take an active role in operations decision-making in their workplace. It will acquaint the student with basic operations management concepts and terminology.   #### BUS-P 300 Introduction to Operations Management  This course provides an overview of operating decisions and practices in both manufacturing- and service-oriented firms. While no attempt is made to cover any particular area in depth, standard terms and concepts required to communicate effectively with operating personnel are introduced.   #### BUS-P 320 Supply Chain Management: Sourcing  As many firms move from a make-to-buy sourcing strategy, this course examines the critical role of the procurement function within the organization. The objective is to provide students with a fundamental understanding of the purchasing/sourcing function, key issues and developments in purchasing and supply management within the context of SCM, and to identify ways that purchasing can make a positive contribution to the competitiveness of the firm. The course examines the purchase process in firms and our personal lives. Topics include an intro to the field/role in SCM; developing global sourcing strategies using commodity/channel/category management; make-or-buy decisions; supplier identification and selection; contract and pricing practices; negotiation; spend analytics including value analysis for services; lean plant evaluation; contract performance monitoring; traditional verse collaborative supplier development; cross-functional relationship management; and ethics.   #### BUS-P 421 Supply Chain Management  This course focuses on the strategic design of supply chains with a particular focus on understanding customer value. Supply chain strategy examines how companies can use the supply chain to gain a competitive advantage. Students develop the ability to conceptualize, design, and implement supply chains aligned with product, market, and customer characteristics. The course approaches supply chain management from a managerial perspective and introduces concepts in a format useful for management decision making, including using case analysis, team-based learning, and business presentations. Topics include: supply chain mapping; supply chains and new products; customer relationship management; sustainability and SCM; performance metrics; collaboration; customer service; and supply chain risk management.   #### BUS-P 429 Operations Processes (Six Sigma Green Belt)  This course involves the analysis of internal business processes fundamental to the efficient operation of any firm, including product creation. The course emphasizes the process flow method using three measures of process achievement: throughput (the rate of product delivery), flow-time (the time it takes to deliver that product), and inventory. Computational analysis using simulation is emphasized. Since changes are usually done within the context of a project, skills in the management of projects are also developed in the course. Value chain and lean management concepts related to reductions in process variability, time, and waste will be emphasized in the course. Topics include: Little’s Law; the uses of inventory; the importance of time-based competition; bottleneck analysis; process design principles; static process analysis; value chain analysis; process variability and quality; and managing the change process.   #### BUS-P 431 Supply Chain Management: Logistics and Distribution  This course is designed to equip students with a comprehensive understanding of the logistics function within a world economy. SCM coordinates both information and material. Logistics is the combination of transport, storage and control of material from the raw material supplier, through all facilities, to the end customer and includes the collection of returns and recyclable material. The course encompasses both the qualitative and quantitative aspect of logistics management. It describes existing logistical practices in a global economy and examines ways and means to apply logistics principles to achieve competitive advantage. Topics include: transportation modes; carrier selection; transportation costing; development of lean logistics strategies that integrate services; design and management of the warehouse/distribution network; transportation planning and execution (domestic and international); IT systems in logistics including RFID; material handling and packaging systems; and reverse logistics.   #### BUS-P 455 Advanced Manufacturing Management  This course is designed to teach students about operations and decision technologies in manufacturing management.   ### Manufacturing-related classes available in 2022-23   ### Evening MBA manufacturing courses at IUPUI   #### BUS-P 501 Operations Management  This course surveys the management of operations in manufacturing and service firms. Diverse activities comprise this function of the company, such as determining the size and type of production process, purchasing the appropriate raw materials, planning and scheduling the flow of materials and the nature and content of inventories, assuring product quality, and deciding on the production hardware and how it gets used. Managing operations well requires both strategic and tactical skills. Topics include process analysis, workforce issues, materials management, quality and productivity, technology, and strategic planning; all combined with relevant analytical techniques. The course makes considerable use of business cases, and most classes will be spent discussing the cases assigned. For each case, students will be asked to review actual company situations and apply technical and managerial skills in order to recommend courses of action. Most cases will be taken from manufacturing, but some will be service-oriented. Several of the cases will focus on international companies or issues. This course is for MBA students enrolled in Module 2A.   #### BUS-P 509 Supply Chain Operations  The goal of this course is to introduce the main trade-offs involved in supply chain management and the associated challenges and opportunities. The course consists of three parts: 1) supply chain fundamentals, 2) challenges in and coordination of decentralized supply chains, and 3) emerging supply chain challenges and opportunities.   #### BUS-P 527 Process Improvement I  Process Improvement I covers a variety of tools and organizational procedures for understanding, analyzing, and improving work processes and environments. Many of these tools and procedures have been popularized lately as “six sigma” quality-management techniques, and apply readily to quite diverse business and organizational settings.   #### BUS-P 528 Process Improvement II  This course involves a real-world project selected and carried out by the student. This allows application of the tools and procedures the student gained in the prior course. Students who successfully complete both Process Improvement courses receive formal six sigma “Green Belt” certification. Courses open to all graduate students.   #### BUS-P 552 Project Management  This course begins with an introduction to project management and some of the skills and concepts surrounding good practice. Project management tools, such as the critical path and Gantt charts, will be reviewed as well as methods for controlling the four most important elements of any project: scope, time, cost, and resources. Various approaches to organizing projects will be introduced. The course will then move to an examination of new product development in a series of industries.   #### BUS-P 561 Supply Chain Management and Technologies  Global Supply Chain Management focuses on managing the supply chain system. The course familiarizes students with the types of decisions involved in designing, planning, and controlling material flow in a supply chain, along with exposing them to a sample of tools available for assisting in making these decisions. Case studies and applications are included to reinforce and enliven material.   #### BUS-J 576 Health Care Operations Management  This course examines health care improvements including flow management; six sigma/lean management; capacity planning and resource management; performance metrics and outcomes management; integrated care delivery; and team delivery models. The course balances theoretical and practical perspectives on operations management as well as provides coverage of current operational challenges.   #### BUS-W 523 Business Innovation and Disruptive Technology  This is a three credit hour course. This course equips students to accomplish outcomes in managerial and executive roles. Students learn to anticipate technology change and adjust business processes and relationships with suppliers, customers, and competitors in response to it. Techniques in management of innovation, creativity, disruption, design thought, and rapid prototyping are taught. Across this quarter in W523’s readings, discussions, and projects students will also be introduced to a host of state-of-the-art (and potentially disruptive!) business technologies from artificial intelligence and robotics to 5G cellular and autonomous vehicles.   ### Manufacturing career-related executive skills courses available to EMBAs "

And service-based firms also face a number of issues related to sustainability. Regardless of a company's industry, its supply chain can have a significant impact on sustainability. As companies work with more international and diverse suppliers, it's crucial to understand the total impact of the end-to-end supply chain.  Contrary to the misconception that sustainability is needlessly expensive, implementing sustainable practices can help a firm recoup money spent in the supply chain. In fact, as government regulations on waste output require firms to evolve their practices, implementing sustainability steps can position your organization ahead of the curve.   ## Opportunities Within Operations   ### Waste  U.S. manufacturers generated 25.86 billion pounds of waste in 2019.

    "body": "  ## What is the right accounting path for me? And other questions.  You are considering a new or deeper career path in accounting, and you have questions. You are in the right place. The Graduate Accounting Programs at the Kelley School of Business works with our students to determine the best degree path to fit their career goals.  Watch the five videos below to answer some of the most commonly asked questions about our program.   ### Do I need to be a CPA?  A bachelor’s degree in accounting positions you for a lot of great jobs—including opportunities in government and at companies looking for internal auditors who understand business processes. If you want to work for an accounting firm, however, you’ll need a CPA, which requires additional education beyond a bachelor’s degree.   ### Why pursue a master’s degree?  The Kelley master’s in accounting, which you can complete in one year, provides advanced accounting knowledge for the CPA exam that isn’t covered in undergraduate courses. Plus, the MSA helps you focus on your career—not just your first job. When you’re up for a promotion or apply for an upper-level position, you’ll stand out from the competition because you have a master’s degree. The Kelley MSA is proven to deliver long-term career stability and financial security.   ### Why study graduate accounting at Kelley Indy?  The Kelley School of Business is known far beyond the state of Indiana. We have long-standing relationships with top accounting firms and global companies—including EY, Deloitte, PwC, KPMG, Eli Lilly & Company, and Cummins. For you, that means year-round access to internships and full-time jobs.   ### What is the right accounting path for me?  At Kelley, you can create a degree path to match your career goals. As an accounting student, you can choose degrees and graduate certificates in:  We also offer programs for students who have no previous experience or education in accounting.   ### What if I’m not sure about a master’s degree?  The Kelley School of Business at IUPUI offers three 12 credit graduate certificates that allow you to gain advanced accounting, taxation, or internal audit knowledge—without the commitment of a full master’s degree. A graduate certificate gives you specialized training and will help you stand out for your next career opportunity. Plus, you can apply the credits toward a master’s in accounting or tax when you’re ready. "

The IUPUI Immigration Bridge Program was launched by the Kelley School of Business, in a partnership with the IUPUI Office of International Affairs and top immigration law firm Fragomen, Del Rey, Bernsen & Loewy LLP , to assist international students and recruiters with immigration matters related to employer sponsorship.  [IUPUI Office of International Affairs](http://international.iupui.edu/)  [Fragomen, Del Rey, Bernsen & Loewy LLP](http://www.fragomen.com/)  While this program does not guarantee a visa sponsorship, visa or employment, it does improve the situation for international students being recruited both on and off campus.   ## How it works.  Students—not the recruiting companies—initiate the IUPUI Immigration Bridge Program application. Follow the directions below to begin the process.   ### Students  If you are a student and need U.S. work authorization during the offer phase with an employer, you should start the IUPUI Immigration Bridge Program application.   ### Step 1  You must first inform recruiting companies about the program. Once you have discussed the program with recruiters, fill out a brief E-Form . This authorizes Fragomen to initiate legal consultation with your prospective employer. You must tell recruiting companies about the program before filling out the E-Form to gauge their interest in participating.  [fill out a brief E-Form](https://atlas.iu.edu/)   ### Step 2  After you fill out the E-Form, the Office of International Services will contact the recruiting company for permission to have Fragomen begin the discovery process with the company.   ### Step 3  Fragomen will contact you and your recruiting company with a questionnaire.  Note: The visa process can take several months, depending on Federal Government timetables, with no guarantee of securing an H-1B visa. Employers will cover the full cost of the H-1B visa process.   ### Employers  After you complete the first round of interviews and have a strong interest in hiring an international student, you can begin working with Fragomen to help with the H-1B visa application process.   ### Step 1  The graduating student must fill out a brief E-form with the IUPUI Office of International Affairs .  [IUPUI Office of International Affairs](http://international.iupui.edu/)   ### Step 2  This office will then email you, the recruiter, for permission to have the Fragomen law firm contact you to begin the process.   ### Step 3  With your permission, Fragomen will begin by sending you a questionnaire about the position and your firm’s needs.  Note: The H-1B application process can take several months, depending on Federal Government timetables with no guarantee of securing an H-1B visa. Employers will cover the full cost of the H-1B process.   ## Have questions?  If you have any questions, or want more information, contact Kelley Indianapolis Career Services.  Contact Us "

Yes, all classes and other exercises are completely online—allowing you to complete this healthcare management certificate from any location in the world. Live online classes meet biweekly on Wednesdays, 6-8:40 p.m. ET. Although your classes meet online only six times each quarter, homework and other assignments are due each week (even when class does not meet). This approach is one of the most flexible among healthcare management degrees online.   ### How much time do I need to dedicate each week?  Students tell us they need to invest 3 to 5 hours per week to master the material and complete their assignments. We expect you to dedicate this much time every week, even though classes only meet online every other week.   ### How often do classes meet?  Synchronous classes meet online every other week in each of four 12-week quarters. Class sessions are 2.5 hours long—held 6-8:40 p.m. ET with a 10-minute break. Typically, classes meet in weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11, and students are expected to be present. On the even weeks, classes will not meet live, but you will still have assignments to complete.   ### How many credits is the program?  Considered a mini-MBA, the Graduate Certificate in Medical Management consists of five 3-credit hour courses for a total of 15 credit hours.   ### Do my credits transfer to an MBA program?  Kelley offers two ways to transfer your graduate certificate credit hours to a Kelley MBA program. For those in central Indiana, all 15 credit hours can be transferred into the Kelley Evening MBA , a hybrid program that combines online and in-person education. You need to be able to attend classes in person on the IUPUI campus in downtown Indianapolis. Students interested in the Evening MBA should apply in summer for acceptance in the winter cohort, which starts in early November. Students outside of the Indianapolis area can transfer 12 credit hours into the Kelley Executive Degree Program MBA . Students can apply for any quarter after completing the Graduate Certificate in Medical Management. More information about how to apply to these MBA programs is made available directly to graduate certificate students.

    "body": "  ## Your HR Partners  Small-sized companies and closely held corporations face unique challenges when it comes to engaging and recruiting talent from universities. When you have a small – or even nonexistent – human resources division, you may face stall points in your hiring pipeline. These could include small candidate pools, a lack of access to qualified candidates and a habit of rushing to fill vacant positions. Working with the Kelley School Headquarters of Urban Business (HUB) can help alleviate these issues.   ### How Kelley HUB Can Help  We work with you to develop a customized talent pipeline plan that fits the needs of your company. This allows you to access talent early and streamline your hiring process. By engaging students from high school through graduate school, we can help your organization build a brand that resonates with top business talent.  The Kelley HUB helps you achieve this by addressing:   ## The Benefit of a Talent Pipeline   ### Identify top talent early.  Have you ever needed to fill a position quickly, but couldn’t identify enough qualified candidates? By proactively developing a pipeline of talented prospective employees, there is no rush to find the right candidate when you need one. We work with you to nurture a pipeline of candidates so that over time, you have built relationships and interest among top talent. Once these candidates develop the necessary skills and experience your open position requires, you may formally recruit them.   ### Gain a competitive advantage.  A talent pipeline approach allows your firm’s hiring managers to be highly competitive. Whereas most firms lack an external talent inventory, your pipeline will equip you with higher-quality applicants and faster hiring practices. As candidates come to expect your effective and efficient hiring process, your firm will gain a competitive advantage over your talent competitors.   ## Solutions at Kelley HUB  We offer specific programs designed to help small businesses increase brand awareness among college students. These programs can help grow your applicant pools and make your open positions more competitive.   ## Let’s talk talent.  We want to discuss the opportunity to partner with you in the new HUB career services model.

    "body": "  ## Interim Department Chair and Professor at the IU Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health  Chris Harle thinks a lot about how physicians and patients can effectively use the enormous amount of health-related information generated as people consume healthcare and go about other parts of their daily lives. As a professor of health policy and management and a scientist at the Regenstrief Institute’s Center for Biomedical Informatics, Harle studies how to deliver useful health-related information to decision makers. This means making use of the trail of medical data related to each person’s individual health and wellbeing, including diagnoses, imaging, clinical notes, medications, procedures, and more. “In healthcare, there’s a massive and rapidly growing volume of data in computer systems. While much of this data is immaterial for a given person at a given time, the right information at the right time can make meaningful differences to people’s health. Thus, clinicians and administrators need tools and methods to sift through large volumes of data and find useful information for patients and populations,” Harle said. “Our research team designs and implements new technologies for electronic health records and then studies the effect the technology has on decisions, care quality, safety, and health outcomes.” For physician leaders and healthcare administrators, aggregating and synthesizing data provides insights into what can be done to improve outcomes, financial performance, access, safety, and quality. In the Physician MBA Program, Harle—a graduate of the Tobias Fellows Program—leads the course on Data Analytics for Physician Leaders, which trains clinicians on how to make use of the data at their fingertips. “Physicians and their teams are often the end users when it comes to translating data to healthcare decisions and actions,” Harle said. “ If we can train eager, interested physician leaders with tools and frameworks for thinking about data, analytics, and how those are applied to real-world decisions, that’s a win.”  If we can train eager, interested physician leaders with tools and frameworks for thinking about data, analytics, and how those are applied to real-world decisions, that’s a win.  Harle helps physicians in his course gain a balanced appreciation for the strengths and weaknesses of real-world data they’re creating and consuming every day. With the incredible potential of modern computing and data science methods, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, Harle says there’s a growing need to disentangle the hype from the reality of what these tools can do and how they can be helpful to physician leaders and their organizations.  “Once we can harness the data, it’s important to translate this information into decisions that are useful for a patient or population,” Harle said. “My goal with this course in the Physician MBA Program is to bring perspective to three pillars of data analytics - data creation and quality, data analytics, and how we translate analytics into decisions that matter for people.”  My goal with this course in the Physician MBA Program is to bring perspective to three pillars of data analytics - data creation and quality, data analytics, and how we translate analytics into decisions that matter for people.  Having taught for years in the Kelley Direct Online MBA Program, Harle comes to Indiana University from the University of Florida College of Medicine and the University of Florida Health, where he served as chief research information officer. In this role, his primary responsibility was developing strategy and processes for extracting data from hospitals and medical practices so researchers and clinicians could use it in academia. Having worked closely with physicians in research and innovation, Harle looks forward to instructing them in the Physician MBA Program.  “I’ve worked in partnership with physicians for more than a decade now. I’ve spent a lot of time understanding how they work, how they make decisions, and how they use data,” Harle said. “I’ve worked with physicians in many different ways, and it’s exciting to get in a classroom setting with them to inform their approach to leading change through data analytics.” "

    "body": "  ## Welcome from the Dean  The Greek philosopher Heraclitus said the only constant is change. That is certainly true in the business world, even in the best of times. The last few years have seen accelerated change. Business leaders and entrepreneurs have had to re-imagine their businesses, to market and deliver their products and services differently, to think innovatively about what’s next, and to learn to be nimble in a constant state of transition. At the Kelley School of Business, we don't just teach you how to navigate change, we prepare you to drive it. Our innovative curriculum is built on personal development, teamwork, and experiential learning with an emphasis on global and social responsibility. We help you recognize opportunity where others see chaos and confusion. We help you create momentum, and we connect you to the right people through networking, coaching, and mentoring to help you find your own true success.  Our broad portfolio is built on more than 100 years of business education with groundbreaking programming and initiatives that have made Kelley an innovative leader among business schools. Kelley was among the first to use an integrated-core curricula, the first Top 20 business school to develop an online MBA program, and the first to establish industry-focused immersion and networking groups, such as our Full-Time MBA Academies and our Undergraduate Workshops, as part of the curricula. Kelley also developed a gaming program that helps students navigate ethics-based decisions and offers comprehensive mental wellness programming that has been used as a model for other business schools. Our approach is not \"one size fits all.\" With a variety of majors, minors, certificates, and specialized degree programs, you can create a career path that capitalizes on your interests and your strengths, whether you're just starting out, switching careers, or positioning yourself for a leadership role.

Contact us   ### Amrou Awaysheh  Founding and Executive Director, IU Business Sustainability and Innovation Lab | Associate Professor of Operations Management, IU Kelley School of Business     ## A New Focus on Sustainability  The IU Business Sustainability and Innovation Lab was founded in 2021 by Amrou Awaysheh with the goal of offering years of research and on-the-ground business experience to firms seeking sustainability strategies. By turning these practices into specific, operational improvements, the lab allows companies to examine, understand and leverage these strategies to their competitive advantage.  Awaysheh is a faculty member at the Kelley School of Business at IUPUI, the founding director of the IoT Energy Efficiency Lab and a Research Fellow at the Center for Excellence in Manufacturing at Kelley.  He holds a PhD in operations management from the University of Western Ontario. Awaysheh’s research focuses on how firms leverage and understand their data, enhancing their operations and supply chains to improve their financial performance. He also looks at how firms integrate and manage socially responsible practices in their operations and supply chains to enhance profitability and improve firm valuations.  Since 2008, Awaysheh has managed and participated on over 60 global corporate social responsibility initiatives with Fortune 500 firms. The cumulative impact of these projects resulted in savings of over $2.1 billion and revenue increases of over $1.3 billion. Combined, these projects directed approximately $425 million of investments.  Awaysheh has been working with companies to help enhance their sustainability performance and enhance financial performance. This work has identified the substantial financial benefit that firms can reap by focusing largely on reducing resource consumption, such as energy and water, and eliminating waste generation within their operations.  We focus on developing technologies to help manufacturers better understand energy consumption and work on ways to reduce it.   ## IU Energy Efficiency Lab  Awaysheh also leads the IU Energy Efficiency Lab at the Kelley School of Business. He is part of a multidisciplinary, multi-institution team that received a $70 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy to advance the use of secure and energy-efficient technology in manufacturing.

The Kelley MSA is a much better option than taking less meaningful electives simply to get the 150 credit hours you need to sit for the CPA exam. You can also move seamlessly from your undergraduate degree to one of our graduate certificates in Accounting or Internal Auditing focusing in financial systems. With either option, you’ll build upon your accounting skills while preparing for the CPA exam.  Graduate Accounting Degrees   ### Graduate Taxation  Gain a Master of Science in Taxation (MST) or Graduate Certificate in Taxation to prepare for a career as a tax specialist or business strategist. Customize your tax specialization by choosing up to 10.5 credit hours of electives from tax, accounting, business or law.  Graduate Taxation Degrees   ### Graduate Internal Audit  Demand is high for candidates who have the communication, critical thinking and teamwork skills to excel in internal audit. Our Graduate Certificate in Internal Auditing focusing in operational systems provides the academic foundation to successfully pass the Certified Internal Audit exam , and it’s an excellent launching pad for undergraduate accounting students who do not pursue the CPA.  Graduate Certificate in Internal Auditing  I wanted to earn the +1 MSA degree at Kelley—not only to prepare for the CPA, but also to build a stronger accounting base.

    "body": "  ## We are at a pivotal moment in our nation’s journey toward racial equity.   ### “Go from moment to momentum” has never been more important.  The Kelley School has long been a champion of diversity in education and in business. Our efforts have resulted in more than 100 initiatives that have led to significant improvements in recruitment and retention of diverse students. Nevertheless, the Black Lives Matter movement has shown us that we have not done enough to address systemic racism, prejudice, and privilege, or to prepare our students to be anti-racist business leaders. The Kelley School resolves to do more and do better. We have established committees to examine our systems, structures, and curricula, and to ensure a continuous dialogue with our students, faculty, and staff. Soon, we will be announcing initiatives to address our shortcomings. Only through difficult conversations will we truly begin to achieve our goals of diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice. The moment is now .   ### See where we’ve been and where we’re going.   #### KIMWA  The Kelley Indianapolis MBA Women’s Association is a community of students, alumnae, faculty and staff supporting and promoting women in the Kelley MBA program to achieve their personal and professional goals. Through women-led networking events and workshop opportunities, students develop supportive connections among their peers, who often become mentors as well as lifelong friends and colleagues.  “There’s never been a question in my mind at any point during the MBA as to whether I fit in here at Kelley. Faculty and staff are huge supporters of KIMWA, and do anything they can to help us succeed. KIMWA provides women with an outlet to talk to other women who are all working and going to school to share learnings, opportunities, advice and friendship.”  –Briana Bauer, BS’11, MBA’20   #### Center for Leadership Development (CLD)  The Kelley School of Business helped developed the Center for Leadership Development in the 1970s to foster the advancement of minority youth in Central Indiana as future professional, business and community leaders. In 1975, Kelley School Dean Jack Wentworth helped create a feasibility study on the potential to improve the quality and quantity of minorities in business and industry, which ultimately led to the development of the CLD. Former Kelley Dean Schuyler F Otteson became the first chairman of the CLD Board of Directors, and the school continues to support CLD’s Business Orientation Program on the IUPUI campus.  [Center for Leadership Development](https://cldinc.org/about/)   #### Women in Business Club  The Women in Business Club (WIB) at the Kelley School is a professional development group providing support and educational opportunities to undergraduate business students. WIB hosts professional women as guest speakers to discuss their career experiences and also business recruiters to talk about interviewing and resume best practices.  “Women should not have to be held back from being their best selves simply because of gender discrimination. I love the opportunities WIB can provide women by giving them information, resources and stories from other women in leadership. It is great to be part of something that is bigger than just a club, and Women in Business is definitely a family.”  –Lauryn Groce, BS’21 | WIB President   #### PhD Project  The Kelley School is a long-time supporter of the PhD Project , an organization working to increase workplace diversity and minorities in leadership positions by increasing the diversity of business school faculty who encourage, mentor, support and enhance the preparation of tomorrow’s leaders. Kelley faculty remain involved in the PhD project and our school promotes all open PhD positions through the PhD Project.  [PhD Project](https://www.phdproject.org/)   #### IUPUI Partnerships  The Kelley School of Business is a campus leader in supporting collaborative efforts with the wider IUPUI campus to foster diversity and celebrate various cultures. This includes sponsorship of important dinners hosted by the Multicultural Center , such as dinners to celebrate Martin Luther King Jr., Cesar Chavez and Harvey Milk. Our Evening MBA is also a proud annual sponsor of Soul, Salsa and Sushi, a signature event of the National Black MBA Association, Prospanica, and Indianapolis’ Asian American Alliance. Each year we celebrate the success of our graduating minority students through special events such as the Celebration of Black Graduates and Latin@ Graduation.  [Multicultural Center](https://diversity.iupui.edu/offices/mc/dinners-events/index.html)  The Kelley School also supports the IUPUI Office of Community Engagement as they work with Indianapolis Public Schools to build a pipeline for students interested in the school of business. This includes an entrepreneurship camp for high schoolers. BOSS Summer Camp , hosted at George Washington High School, fosters an interest in business and provides high school students with life skills they can use in college or trade school.  [BOSS Summer Camp](https://blog.kelley.iupui.edu/2019/07/19/striving-for-greatness-high-school-students-learn-entrepreneurship-lessons-during-weeklong-camp/)   #### Grant to Increase Women in Business  Two Kelley faculty members are working to advance women in the workplace. Through a year-long series of workshops funded by a grant, M. Kim Saxton and Charlotte Westerhaus-Renfrow are leading a program to understand barriers a cohort of women face, and then provide skills training to increase their advancement potential. The program provides skills training at no cost to a cohort of Linking Indy Women , a group of more than 2,000 professional women in central Indiana seeking to increase their advancement potential. Through this project, Saxton and Westerhaus-Renfrow hope to better understand the barriers women face when trying to advance their careers, and then use that knowledge to provide specific training with measurable results.  [year-long series of workshops](https://blog.kelley.iupui.edu/2019/04/17/new-program-seeks-to-advance-indy-women-through-year-long-workshop/)  [Linking Indy Women](https://linkingindywomen.com/)  “Women’s advancement in the workplace is stuck. The needle isn’t moving. If women aren’t advancing in central Indiana, the wage gap won’t move either. Indianapolis needs to be a place where the best talent wants to come and stay – and that includes women. Frankly, it’s not just about promoting women because we believe they deserve it, it’s because they DO deserve it.”  –Charlotte Westerhaus Renfrow, clinical assistant professor of business law and management   #### Herman B Wells  Before becoming Indiana University’s progressive and longest serving president, Herman B Wells earned a degree from what is today the Kelley School of Business, which he also led as dean from 1935 to 1937. During his visionary tenure as IU president, he worked to desegregate the campus, community, and intercollegiate athletics prior to the civil rights era.  “Our victory can have little meaning or significance unless we proclaim our belief in the brotherhood of all men, men of all races, classes, and nations, and personally practice our belief by extending the cordial hand of fellowship to all men.”  –Herman B Wells, March 5, 1944   ## IUPUI and IU Bloomington: Excellence in Diversity  IUPUI and IU Bloomington, IU’s core campuses, earned the 2023 Higher Education Excellence in Diversity Award from Insight Into Diversity magazine, the largest, oldest and most respected national diversity and inclusion magazine in higher education.  This is the 12th year IUPUI has been honored with the HEED award and the ninth time for IU Bloomington. In addition, IU Bloomington received the Diversity Champion honor, given only to the top universities in the country, for the seventh consecutive year.  [Learn more about campus initiatives](https://diversity.iu.edu/news-events/news/2023/2023-heed.html)  The HEED Award is open to universities and colleges in the US and Canada. The publication says it “measures an institution’s level of achievement and intensity of commitment in regard to broadening diversity and inclusion on campus through initiatives, programs, and outreach; student recruitment, retention, and completion; and hiring practices for faculty and staff.”   ### Diversity Initiatives   #### Undergraduate Program  Kelley Office of Diversity Initiatives (KODI) MEET Kelley Women's Leadership Institute Finance Diversity Program William R.

    "body": "  ## The value of business sustainability.  The term “sustainability” is often mistaken for feel-good “green” measures that many misinterpret as abstract, expensive or idealistic. However, business sustainability in practice is a long-term operations efficiency plan that saves companies millions — even billions — of dollars each year. At the end of the harvest, the farmer doesn’t throw salt in the field or dump old tractor engine oil into the tilled earth. The farmer’s land is a business asset critical for future growth. Identifying the most efficient use of your company’s production or service can quickly create greater value for your stakeholders now and in the future. Sustainability is not just a “nice to have” measure; it’s an imperative for competitive businesses.  Where we can impact sustainability is through an organization's operations. The goal of the IU Business Sustainability and Innovation Lab is to help individuals and companies understand sustainable practices and how they can become more involved in sustainable careers.  Sustainability is integral to business survival. Even if you aren’t concerned with sustainability, your competitors are working to improve performance, lower their costs, generate more customer excitement and enter new markets. In the long term, those firms survive.   ## The ROI on Sustainability   ### 1. What is sustainability?  Learn more about the concept of sustainability: what it means related to your firm, how to identify some easy wins and how it can affect your bottom line.  What is sustainability?   ### 2. The Problem  U.S. manufacturers generated 25.86 billion pounds of waste in 2019 and use 20.7 trillion gallons of water annually. But not all of these used resources go to waste. Learn how to identify opportunities for efficiency at your firm, regardless of your industry.  The Problem   ### 3. How to Create Impact  Companies who take advantage of sustainable practices can save hundreds of millions – collectively billions – of dollars over time. We’ve helped many firms get started, and you can learn from their successes.  Our Impact   ## Connect with us.  Is there room for positive impact in your firm?

As soon as they progress forward, the bar moves again.  The IU Kelley School Center for Excellence in Manufacturing tracks this revolution  and monitors trends to provide business leaders insight into this ever-changing industry. Our center finds and illuminates the most effective trends for companies while helping our students develop the skills that managers need.  An increasing number of undergraduate and MBA students who study supply chain management are pursuing careers in manufacturing. We help them develop the understanding, vision, and flexibility necessary to enter this industry and lead these companies into the future.  —Mark Frohlich , Gregg and Sabine Sherrill Director of Excellence in Manufacturing, Associate Professor of Operations Management  This endowment recognizes the need to help companies create manufacturing strategies that support long-term business success. We know the next generation of managers will have tremendous opportunities in the manufacturing sector, and we want to help them prepare to take advantage of those opportunities.   ### Gregg and Sabine Sherrill: A gift and a vision  The IU Kelley School Center for Excellence in Manufacturing was created with the support of a $1 million endowed gift from Kelley alumnus Gregg Sherrill, MBA’91, and his wife, Sabine, for whom the directorship of the center is named. An executive chairman of the board of Tenneco Inc. and past chair of the National Association of Manufacturers board, Gregg Sherrill has recognized—throughout his 40 years in the manufacturing sector—the need to adapt and change as manufacturing itself changes. The Sherrills’ gift helps manufacturers and future managers adapt to that change.   ### The Evolution of U.S. Manufacturing  In this 2018 Kelley ROI podcast, Gregg Sherrill discusses ways the manufacturing industry has changed and where it’s headed.

    "body": "  ## Vice Dean, Kelley Indianapolis Professor of Business Law Kelley Venture Fellow Academic and Executive Director, Tobias Leadership Center  Much like the interdisciplinary nature of the healthcare industry, faculty collaboration spans across many fields of study at the Kelley School of Business.  \"One of the great aspects of being part of Kelley’s faculty is our collaborative culture that enables synergy,” says Julie Manning Magid. “Conducting research and teaching in an interdisciplinary environment offers so many different ways to think about your work and its relevance to the world of healthcare.”  Collaborating with Kelley Indianapolis colleagues in the marketing, management, and operations fields, Magid has participated in research projects ranging from brand image and trademarks to radio frequency identification (RFID) and privacy law. RFIDs are often used in hospitals to track medical care and devices. Magid's most recent research concerns employment contracting to promote innovation in healthcare.  My classes teach how to make decisions when there are high degrees of ambiguity. I really feel what I teach is not just law; it's critical thinking skills.  Although she enjoyed her days as a courtroom litigator, Magid finds that teaching business law combines the characteristics she likes most about being a lawyer.  “To be an effective litigator, you must be able to think through different options and different ways to view a problem,” Magid explains. “My classes teach how to make business decisions when there are high degrees of ambiguity. I really feel what I teach is not just law; it’s critical thinking skills.”  One area in which physicians commonly face ambiguity is in healthcare ethics. Magid developed a program called “Tense Tales: Storytelling for Ethical Leadership,” which she uses to guide physicians through these thorny issues. “Healthcare decisions inevitably involve ethical challenges, and physicians need a framework to use in evaluating ethical concerns and building their confidence in responding to them,” she says.  Similar to the way in which a physician diagnoses a patient, legal business decision making requires the consumption of a large amount of information, a prompt analysis, and decisive plan of action, Magid says. Her courses teach how to think critically about the impact of a business decision.  Business law has many roles in the healthcare field. Among them are employment and organizational contracts, legal issues around partnerships, and managing employees and intellectual property.  “There are many legal considerations in a healthcare practice,” Magid explains. “From healthcare conflicts of interest to clinical integration, physicians need a basic understanding of the business legal parameters in which these issues are couched.”  As healthcare professionals face a growing number of legal challenges including interpretation of new healthcare laws, Magid says a strong foundation of business law understanding will be essential.  “Healthcare is a highly regulated environment and professionals need to understand not only the applicable regulations but also the legal grounding for these regulations,” says Magid. “Having a critical understanding of business law will allow physicians to create a better healthcare environment.” "

But compared to your larger competitors, you may lack the staffing, resources and brand recognition that attracts the best candidates. By building a relationship with the Kelley School of Business, you can boost your reputation among potential talent. The Kelley School Headquarters of Urban Business (HUB) can work with you to gain access to the right candidates for your open positions while growing your firm’s reputation as a sought-after employer.   ### How Kelley HUB Can Help  We work with you to develop a customized talent pipeline that allows you to access candidates early while streamlining your hiring process. By engaging students from high school to graduate school, we help your organization build a brand that resonates with top-tier business talent.  The Kelley HUB helps you achieve this by:   ## The Benefit of a Talent Pipeline   ### Higher Offer Acceptance Rates  Students in your recruiter’s inventory have time to learn about and appreciate your company, as well as the benefits of joining your team. At the same time, you gain insights into your talent pool. This two-way communication helps you capture and understand the unique needs of the candidates you are targeting. As a result, you can customize offers to meet your ideal candidate’s unique needs, which can dramatically increase your offer acceptance rates from students in this inventory.   ### A Superior Candidate Experience  As it improves your hiring process, a talent pipeline also identifies and meets candidates’ needs. With more time available to engage, answer questions and communicate with you, candidates have an elevated experience throughout your hiring process.   ### More Diverse Prospects and Hires  It’s often difficult to identify and sell the best diverse prospects. By using a talent pipeline approach, you have more time to find and then convince diverse individuals to apply to your firm, which can increase diversity in your hiring choices. With less of a rush to assess and sell, more diverse hires will accept your offers.   ## Solutions at Kelley HUB  The Kelley HUB offers programs to help medium-sized businesses build the reputation on campus that attracts top candidates while developing a talent pipeline to meet your future hiring needs.   ## Let’s talk talent.  We want to discuss the opportunity to partner with you in the new HUB career services model.

    "body": "  ## Strengthen your tax specialization with this customizable curriculum.  Tax expertise is a specialty every individual and organization needs. Gain a deeper understanding of the tax code, and leverage your expertise to help your company or organization make strategic and informed financial decisions. Get started with the Graduate Certificate in Taxation, and go at your own pace to earn an MST.   ### Graduate Certificate in Taxation   ### Master of Science in Taxation (MST)  The MST degree can be earned during full-time or part-time study. Once you complete the Graduate Certificate in Taxation, you need only six additional courses to earn your MST.  The 30 credit hours required for the MST Program is composed of 18 hours of required courses and 12 hours of elective courses.   #### Prerequisites  To ensure your success, we ask you to complete the following course — or its equivalent — before you begin the MST Program.   #### Required Courses   ##### A515 Introduction to Taxation (3 cr.)  Co-requisite: A551  This course focuses on the income taxation and tax planning for individuals, introducing students to U.S. federal income tax law. The basic treatment of other entities also is considered, including the taxation of corporations, partnerships, limited liability companies, trusts, and estates. In addition, a portion of the course is devoted to tax research, enabling students to appreciate the sources of tax law such as the Internal Revenue Code, regulations, administrative pronouncements, and case law.   ##### A551 Tax Research (1.5 cr.)  Prerequisite: A515 or concurrent C  This course covers how to access the primary and secondary sources of tax law, including the Internal Revenue Code, regulations, and other administrative pronouncements and judicial decisions, with an emphasis on how to read and interpret those source materials.   ##### A539 Advanced Taxation I: Entity Issues (3 cr.)  Prerequisite: A515 or equivalent  This course introduces students to the taxation of regular corporations, partnerships, limited liability companies, and S corporations.   ##### A525 Pass-through Entities I (3 cr.)  Prerequisite: A539 or equivalent  This course builds upon the introductory material included in BUPA A539 (Advanced Taxation I: Entity Issues) pertaining to the U.S. federal income taxation of partnerships and corporations taxed as passthrough entities under Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code (“S corporations”) to provide Master of Science in Taxation (MST) candidates, tax‐focused Master of Science in Accounting (MSA) candidates, and other MSA candidates seeking a well‐rounded understanding of issues within the responsibility of accounting professionals with a more complete understanding of the fundamental structure of U.S. federal income taxation of partnerships and S corporations.   ##### A537 Corporate Taxation I (3 cr.)  Prerequisite: A539 or equivalent  This course builds upon the introductory material included in BUPA A539 (Advanced Taxation I: Entity Issues) pertaining to the U.S. federal income taxation of corporations taxable under Subchapter C of the Internal Revenue Code (‘C corporations’) to provide Master of Science in Taxation (MST) candidates, tax focused Master of Science in Accounting (MSA) candidates, and other MSA candidates seeking a well-rounded understanding of issues within the responsibility of accounting professionals with a more complete understanding of the fundamental structure of U.S. federal income taxation of C corporations.   ##### A528 State & Local Taxation (3 cr.)  Prerequisite: A515 or equivalent  Examines the basic principles of state and local taxation.  Taxes studied are income taxes, sales taxes, use taxes, inheritance taxes, estate tases, personal property taxes, real property taxes, and excise taxes.   ##### A507 Federal Tax Practice and Procedures (1.5 cr.)  Prerequisite: A515 or equivalent  This course focuses on the substantive rules and procedures involved with preparing tax returns and representing taxpayers before the IRS as a tax professional. The course was designed with reference to the Uniform CPA Examination Blueprint for ethics, professional responsibilities and federal tax procedures, the study topics for the IRS Special Enrollment Examination addressing representation, practices and procedures. As such, it will provide a foundation for the student’s preparation to sit for either of these examinations.   #### Learning in a Professional Environment  At the Kelley School of Business at IUPUI, we understand real-life work experience is essential to success outside of the classroom. Learning in a Professional Environment (LIPE) allows you to earn up to three hours of graduate credit for work experience you obtain while earning your MS in Taxation.  Learning in a Professional Environment is a required course for international students who secure an internship, and we highly recommend it for those students who come to the MST Program without previous work experience in taxation or accounting. LIPE provides a way to put taxation skills into practice while developing professional acumen.   #### Electives   ##### A526 Pass-through Entities II (3 cr.)  Prerequisite: A525  This course builds upon the intermediate material included in BUPA A525 (Pass‐through Entities I) pertaining to the U.S. federal income taxation of partnerships and corporations taxed as pass‐through entities under Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code (“S corporations”) to provide Master of Science in Taxation (MST) candidates, tax‐focused Master of Science in Accounting (MSA) candidates, and other MSA candidates seeking a well‐rounded understanding of issues within the responsibility of accounting professionals with a more complete understanding of the fundamental structure of U.S. federal income taxation of partnerships and S corporations.   ##### A538 Corporate Tax II (3 cr.)  Prerequisite: A539  This course develops in-depth corporate tax knowledge and gives studies experience preparing assignments similar to those prepared by tax practitioners. Topics include corporate liquidations, penalty taxes, corporate reorganizations, and consolidated tax returns.     ##### A558 Taxation of Tax-Exempt Organization I (1.5 cr.)  Examines the tax treatment of public and private charities exempt under I.R.C. Sec. 501(c)(3), as well as business leagues, social clubs and other types of tax-exempt organizations. Includes discussion of the requirements for exemption from federal income tax, the tax treatment of the unrelated business income tax and private foundation status, and its repercussions.   ##### A567 Taxation of Tax-Exempt Organizations II (1.5 cr.)  Provides an overview of the basic concepts of the laws and regulations governing not-for-profit (NFP) organizations. Specific topics include: the formation and dissolution of a NFP entity, the operation, and governance of the NFP entity, tax exemption issues, unrelated business income tax, and charitable contributions.  You also have the option to take approved Kelley MSA and Evening MBA courses to fulfill your electives.   ## Questions?

    "body": "  ## The value of business sustainability.  The term “sustainability” is often mistaken for feel-good “green” measures that many misinterpret as abstract, expensive or idealistic. However, business sustainability in practice is a long-term operations efficiency plan that saves companies millions — even billions — of dollars each year. At the end of the harvest, the farmer doesn’t throw salt in the field or dump old tractor engine oil into the tilled earth. The farmer’s land is a business asset critical for future growth. Identifying the most efficient use of your company’s production or service can quickly create greater value for your stakeholders now and in the future. Sustainability is not just a “nice to have” measure; it’s an imperative for competitive businesses.  Where we can impact sustainability is through an organization's operations. The goal of the IU Business Sustainability and Innovation Lab is to help individuals and companies understand sustainable practices and how they can become more involved in sustainable careers.  Sustainability is integral to business survival. Even if you aren’t concerned with sustainability, your competitors are working to improve performance, lower their costs, generate more customer excitement and enter new markets. In the long term, those firms survive.   ## The ROI on Sustainability   ### 1. What is sustainability?  Learn more about the concept of sustainability: what it means related to your firm, how to identify some easy wins and how it can affect your bottom line.  What is sustainability?   ### 2. The Problem  U.S. manufacturers generated 25.86 billion pounds of waste in 2019 and use 20.7 trillion gallons of water annually. But not all of these used resources go to waste. Learn how to identify opportunities for efficiency at your firm, regardless of your industry.  The Problem   ### 3. How to Create Impact  Companies who take advantage of sustainable practices can save hundreds of millions – collectively billions – of dollars over time. We’ve helped many firms get started, and you can learn from their successes.  Our Impact   ## Connect with us.  Is there room for positive impact in your firm?

A town named:  And that doesn’t even begin to cover the excitement of being on a Big Ten campus during basketball season (go Hoosiers!) or during “the world's greatest college weekend”—the weekend of the Little 500 bicycle race which inspired the Academy Award–winning movie, Breaking Away .

    "body": "  ## Make an impact right away with real-world accounting and auditing courses.  Whether you want to work as a corporate accountant or as an auditor at a CPA firm, there is a graduate accounting degree or certificate that fits your goals. Study full time or part time for your MSA degree, or begin with a graduate certificate first. Earn the Graduate Certificate in Accounting or a Graduate Certificate in Internal Auditing (in financial systems) to add a credential, and then, pursue a graduate degree at your own pace.   ### Graduate Certificate in Accounting   #### Undergraduate Accounting Electives (for students not enrolled in the graduate certificate)   #### Undergraduate Accounting Electives (for students enrolled in the graduate certificate)  These courses are for students enrolled in the graduate certificate.   #### Graduate Certificate-Only Accounting Electives  These courses are offered during your last six hours of completing the Graduate Certificate in Accounting.   ### Graduate Certificate in Internal Auditing Focusing in Financial Systems   ### Master of Science in Accounting (MSA)  The MSA degree can be earned during full-time or part-time study. Once you complete the Graduate Certificate in Accounting, you need only six additional courses to earn your MSA.   #### Prerequisites  To ensure your success, we ask you to complete the following courses — or their equivalents — before you begin the MSA Program.   #### Required Courses   ##### A511 Financial Accounting Theory and Practice II (3 cr.)  Prerequisite: A311/A510 (Intermediate Accounting I) or equivalent  Application of intermediate accounting theory to problems involving long-term liabilities, corporations, earnings per share, tax allocation, pensions, leases, and cash flows.   ##### A514 Auditing Theory and Practice (3 cr.)  Prerequisites: A511 and A523  This course addresses the concepts and procedures of external and internal audits for businesses, including issuance of the audit report, reviews of internal control, statistical sampling, EDP systems, the company's business cycles, forensic accounting, auditing for fraud, and other assurance services. Many topics covered are included on the CPA exam.   ##### A515 Introduction to Taxation (3 cr.)  Co-requisite: A551  This course focuses on the income taxation and tax planning for individuals, introducing students to U.S. federal income tax law. The basic treatment of other entities also is considered, including the taxation of corporations, partnerships, limited liability companies, trusts, and estates. In addition, a portion of the course is devoted to tax research, enabling students to appreciate the sources of tax law such as the Internal Revenue Code, regulations, administrative pronouncements, and case law.   ##### A551 Tax Research (1.5 cr.)  Prerequisite: A515 or concurrent  This course covers how to access the primary and secondary sources of tax law, including the Internal Revenue Code, regulations, and other administrative pronouncements and judicial decisions, with an emphasis on how to read and interpret those source materials.   ##### A523 Business Information Systems (3 cr.)

Prerequisite: L203 or equivalent  This course examines concepts of law as applied to the accounting profession, including contracts, agency, forms of organization, property, wills and trusts, securities regulation, consumer protection, antitrust, secured transactions, negotiable instruments, commercial paper, payment systems, bankruptcy, and related subject areas.  If you've previously completed one of the accounting courses above and used it toward another degree, you may replace it with an approved elective.   #### Learning in a Professional Environment  We understand real-life work experience is essential to success outside of the classroom. Learning in a Professional Environment (LIPE) allows you to earn up to three hours of graduate credit for work experience you obtain while earning your MS in Accounting.  Learning in a Professional Environment is a required course for international students who secure an internship, and we highly recommend it for those students who come to the MSA Program without previous work experience in accounting. LIPE provides a way to put accounting skills into practice while developing professional acumen.   #### Electives   ##### Accounting   ##### A517 Financial Statement Analysis (3 cr.)  Financial statement analysis is a problem-solving case course designed to teach and understand the techniques used to evaluate the financial dynamics of businesses.   ##### A560 Information Technology Auditing (3 cr.)

As the healthcare industry continues to evolve, there’s a growing demand for leaders who possess both medical expertise and business acumen.

Physician MBAs have the intimate experience in clinical settings needed to understand the challenges in the healthcare landscape, and they've also earned the business acumen to help solve them. Combining the Kelley Physician MBA with your clinical expertise, you’ll be uniquely positioned to lead change—not just react to it.

    "body": "  ## Gain experience before you graduate through a real estate certificate  Whether you are studying economics, psychology, or public policy, you bring a unique set of skills and talents to the field of real estate. The undergraduate Real Estate Certificate from the Kelley School of Business provides non-business majors with the skills to qualify for entry-level real estate jobs. This certificate offers you training for careers in property and asset management, brokerage (though it does not count towards a real estate license), appraisal, development, investment, mortgage finance, private equity, and property tax, among others.   ### Are you interested in real estate?  There are more jobs in real estate than there are qualified, available workers, so if you are interested in this industry, now is the time to align your training with your career goals. Combine your non-business degree with this real estate certificate to diversify your skill sets as you enter the job market. Through this program, you will gain an understanding of the financial aspects and economic principles related to real estate. Combined with your current experience and education, you will offer employers a unique perspective on the industry. Not only will you gain the knowledge to work in real estate, you will also learn more about prospective careers by connecting with guest speakers and networking with industry professionals.   #### Potential Real Estate Careers  While the real estate market is booming, a lack of qualified applicants places a significant cap on companies to pursue opportunities. Offering real estate credentials to non-business majors not only creates a larger applicant pool, but a more diverse one.”  Real estate is a multi-disciplinary field that requires a thorough understanding of real estate and financial analysis, as well as communication and organizational skills. Non-business students often bring a fresh perspective and innovative solutions to these areas.”   ## Requirements and Qualifications   ## Do I qualify?  To qualify for this certificate, you must be an admitted or current student at IUPUI not enrolled in the Kelley School of Business. (Kelley students may consider the Real Estate Co-Major .)  To qualify, you must:   ## Course Requirements for a Real Estate Certificate  The certificate in real estate requires 15 undergraduate credit hours plus a 3 credit hour prerequisite course. The core courses build upon one other, taking you from the foundations of real estate finance and analysis through to investment analysis. There is one prerequisite course, and the following courses must be taken in order:    (Prerequisite) L203 or L204  Commercial Law I (or Honors Commercial Law I)  This course is for accounting majors and others who want an understanding of tort and antitrust law and the law of agency, partnership, and corporations.  3  F200 or F300  Foundations of Financial Management or Introductory Financial Management  This course is designed to introduce the student to the basic decision models of financial management and to prepare the student to take an active role in financial decision-making in their workplace.  3  R305  Introduction to Real Estate Analysis  This course is designed as a general principles course, intended to offer a comprehensive overview of the field of real estate and to provide initial exposure to the methods and techniques of real estate financial analysis, valuation, and decision-making. This course provides a broad introduction to real estate topics, including real estate interests and title, mortgage finance, brokerage, appraisal, property and asset management, development, and investment analysis. Analytical techniques emphasized within this course are directly applicable to real estate, finance, and accounting careers, while also providing exposure to skills supportive of property ownership and investment. Offered fall and spring semesters.  3  L408  Prerequisite: L203 or L204 with a grade of C or higher.

Real Estate Appraisals  The purpose of this course is to engage in the analyses of practicing real estate professionals by developing a practical understanding of real estate valuation methods and techniques and the ability to apply them. Primary emphasis is on the concept of highest and best use and the creation of value through the development process. This course uses a combination of analytical and case study methodologies, and students spend a considerable amount of time in class meetings discussing real-world examples, current market information, and practical applications of topics, as well as seeking to “connect the dots” and form “the big picture” of how all of these topics relate to each other. Offered spring semester only.  R443  Prerequisite: F200 or F300 and R305 with a grade of C or higher.  Real Estate Finance & Investment Analysis  The purpose of this course is to deepen students’ understanding and abilities in the areas of real estate financing mechanisms and key investment metrics. Primary emphasis within this course is placed on the development of a practical understanding and application of real estate financing methods and techniques, as well as an array of investment analysis tools for income property evaluation and decision-making.  A combination of analytical and case study methodology is used, with a focus on selecting amongst complex financing options, use of leverage, performing investor-specific before- and after-tax cash flow and effective tax rate analyses, and presentation of recommendations to clients, with an emphasis on analysis justification and explanation. Offered fall semester only.  3         ## Considering the Real Estate Certificate?   ### Connect with us.  Let’s discuss how the Real Estate Certificate can help you achieve your career goals.
