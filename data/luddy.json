    "body": "  ## MAS intern uses art and technology to promote healing via digital storytelling  February 18, 2020  This story contains sensitive topics that some readers may find upsetting.  When Mary Katherine Fitzpatrick decided to return to college to finish her degree after a long hiatus, she knew she had a passion for art but also wanted to combine her appreciation for visual communication with the growing landscape of social media. “Originally I was seeking a degree in art education but wanted to switch my area of study to something in the field of computing and technology. Every organization around the world is now about managing and securing data. I wanted to be a direct part of that field,” Fitzpatrick said.  Her degree in Media Arts and Science (MAS) with a specialization in digital storytelling from the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI (SoIC) was a perfect fit and led her to an internship experience with Ascent121 last fall. Fitzpatrick met the organization’s volunteer coordinator at Indiana Black Expo and after learning about their work, she knew she wanted to do anything she could to support their mission.  “Art has a powerful ability to help with healing. It’s a natural spring of joy, and I want to help children develop their creative talents as a coping skill.”  Ascent121 offers clinical recovery services for central Indiana teens—providing interventions and a continuum of care for survivors of sexual exploitation—and hosts awareness and professional development training for community members.  Fitzpatrick recognized there were common misconceptions about trafficking and wanted to make sure people understood the truth. “I want to make sure that in this age of information that we are getting accurate stories so that we may efficiently and effectively solve social issues,” she said.  Her experience at Ascent121 and her volunteer work with the School of Informatics and Computing’s iDEW program also solidified her interest in working with children in Indiana. “Art therapy is one of the tools used at Ascent121, and I remember how excited the students in the iDEW program were when we had days we could draw and be creative. Art has a powerful ability to help with healing. It’s a natural spring of joy, and I want to help children develop their creative talents as a coping skill,” Fitzpatrick said.  The majority of Fitzpatrick’s time was spent representing Ascent121 during information events like the School of Informatics and Computing’s Career Fair, conferences, and training events. She also gathered raw footage of outreach events, created templates, did data entry, designed the organization’s t-shirt, and whatever else was needed.  Fitzpatrick credits fellow students and many others for their support and advice along the way, including MAS faculty John King, Rodney Smith, Mathew Powers, Joseph Defazio, Zeb Wood, and Jacob Dobson; SoIC staff Vicki Daugherty and Pat Rhodes; and Herron School of Art and Design faculty Anila Quayyam Agha. Rhodes, career service specialist at the School of Informatics and Computing, said, “After meeting with Mary, I quickly realized this internship was the opportunity for her to showcase her many talents. Mary’s passion and skillset along with the mission of Ascent121 was the perfect match to climax her educational experience!  I am very proud of Mary and envision greater things to come from her in the immediate future.”  Fitzpatrick has her own advice for others looking for unique and meaningful ways to apply their media arts and science skills. “I would encourage all students to attend career fairs, make an appointment with career services, and visit indianaintern.net. Finding the right internship will happen,” she said.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Mission  The mission of the Indiana University Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering at IUPUI is to excel in education, research, and civic engagement in the field of informatics, an integrative discipline which advances knowledge in:  The School fosters a broad and interdisciplinary view of informatics and uses this view to explore and expand knowledge in informatics education and research. Along with the many schools and departments located on the Indiana University Purdue University urban Indianapolis campus (IUPUI), the School is firmly committed to a welcoming environment, a diverse faculty and student body, and to efforts which support Indiana’s economic development.  Together, the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering at IU Bloomington and at Indianapolis (IUPUI) aim to lead the nation in creating a new, broad and interdisciplinary view of informatics and uses this viewpoint as the foundation for three foci:   ### Education and Research  The School’s primary emphasis is in education and research, offering a broad array of B.S., M.S., and Ph.D., programs and a research agenda that emphasizes the breadth of informatics as an interdisciplinary field of study. The School is at the forefront of innovation in education and provides an informatics curriculum which focuses on computing and information technology, while giving equal attention to the complex interactions of technology, individuals, and society. Students of Informatics learn skills which allow them to use computing to solve real human problems in areas such as healthcare, education, poverty, security, and the environment.  Equally important is the fact that Informatics maintains a strong focus on the human use of computing. For example, informatics students build new computing tools and applications while studying how people interact with those technologies and how those technologies shape our relationships, our organizations, and our community. Informatics is a professional school which goes beyond the study of technology in and of itself, to identify, define, and address information problems in a range of disciplines with a variety of technologies and methodologies.  The School also conducts research in a wide range of computing and informatics foundations, applications, and their implications. The School brings a unique perspective that combines information science with a deep understanding of domain-specific areas of research, such as the biological, health, and life sciences, medical and biomedical sciences, cognitive and social sciences, media arts and science, the law and legal domains, business, and human-computer interaction design and usability engineering.   ### Economic Development and Entrepreneurship  The School is also deeply engaged in the area of economic development and entrepreneurship. In addition to its primary mission in education and research, the School trains well-equipped graduates for a wide range of computing and information technology occupations by placing a special emphasis on:   ### Diversity  The School also fosters an inclusive educational and research culture and environment by: "

    "body": "  ## School of Informatics and Computing announces new “2+2” program with China’s Sun Yat-sen University  December 29, 2010  IUPUI’s innovative and award-winning approach to international education has taken another step forward.  As part of its strategic alliance with Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU) – southern China’s leading university – IUPUI is moving forward with a new program in which top Chinese students from SYSU will undertake a collaborative ‘dual degree’ program in media arts and science at the School of Informatics and Computing.  After studying for two years in China, the School of Informatics and Computing and IUPUI will become the home base for students’ junior and senior years. Students successfully completing their courses of study will receive a bachelor’s degree in media arts and science from Indiana University, as well as a degree from Sun Yat-sen University.  The first of the SYSU students could begin their studies in Indianapolis as soon as early next year. The so-called “two plus two” program in media arts and science is one of three such programs being launched between SYSU and IUPUI. An additional three dual-degree programs are also in the pipeline.  “The 2+2 program will greatly enhance the cultural exchanges between the students and faculty of our universities. The relationship is truly two-way, as the School of Informatics and Computing is now launching a study-abroad program in China for IUPUI students,” said Edgar Huang, associate professor of media arts and science at the School of Informatics and Computing.  A top-ranked Chinese University, SYSU is located in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou. The South China region is one of the most significant drivers of the Chinese economy.  IUPUI and SYSU signed a Memorandum of Strategic Alliance in December 2009, culminating a two-year exploration of the feasibility of establishing a campus-wide partnership between the two universities.  Strategic alliances are long-term, comprehensive collaborations between two universities that advance the internationalization of each institution while also providing vital linkages for the communities in which these institutions are located. They cut across disciplinary boundaries, harnessing the full capacity of each institution for work that is of significant mutual benefit.  In this case, the strategic alliance is providing IUPUI students, faculty and staff with a direct connection and deeper understanding of China. It also links IUPUI to the significant research that is being done at SYSU in science, technology and development and a whole range of other disciplines.  A campus goal is to make IUPUI students from Indiana and other locations around the U.S. feel at home with students from around the world, whether they travel abroad or not, said Susan Sutton, outgoing associate vice chancellor of international affairs at IUPUI, and board member of the Confucius Institute in Indianapolis.  IUPUI is pursuing an innovative approach to international education that already has garnered a top award. The Institute of International Education (IIE) honored IUPUI with the Andrew Heiskell Award for International Partnerships. The prestigious Heiskell Awards were established by IIE to recognize and promote outstanding international higher education initiatives among its member colleges and universities.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Professors Collaborate with Elementary School to Create Educational Animations  June 11, 2014  Educational animations are on the rise. The industry is growing as developers are being asked to use technology to create relevant materials for children.  More and more educators are researching different ways they can make learning exciting and engaging for children in this Digital Age. To many it’s no surprise that technology keeps topping the list. But more importantly it’s the way in which technology is used for one Indiana elementary school.  Iggys Adventures , a series of short animations depicting specific scientific concepts, was developed in collaboration with the elementary school’s teachers. The topics included slow erosion, quick erosion, and kinetic and potential motion.  The movie was produced by Albert William , M.S. and Zeb Wood , M.S., both lecturers of the 3D and Animation classes in the Media Arts and Science (MAS) program, as well as MAS graduate and undergraduate students, in the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI.  [Albert William](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/albert-william/)  [Zeb Wood](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/zeb-wood/)  “We wanted to create something that doesn’t look like typical low-budget animation. So we came up with the toon outline. It worked well with most of the scenes, but mostly we wanted it to look different and give it a unique style,” said William.  The videos feature a loveable, but ambiguous, character who experiences first hand the scientific concepts at work. The art style, envisioned by one of the MAS undergraduate students, flaunts a comic book style look in almost every scene.  “The movie will be an invaluable tool to use when teaching the different Science topics. The animated visual representations really illustrate science concepts, which are difficult for children to grasp by reading textbooks alone,” said Kristie Satterfield, 4 th grade teacher at Brandywine Elementary in Greenfield, Indiana.  The video was a surprise for the 4 th grade students. “We played the video and then we showed them how it was made. They began asking questions, and they started to get more open. So when we showed it again after the presentation, they were cheering. I think they understood what they were looking at and how much work and love went into it,” said Wood.  The project was accomplished through the MAS 3D production course. There were 7 undergraduate students and one graduate student involved in the project. “While there were challenges, it went very smoothly and we were very appreciative of the professionalism of our students,” said Wood.  Wood and William had their own surprise at the end of the presentation. “All the kids wanted our autographs. We handed out some swag and were being asked to sign them by the kids,” said William. “It was amazing seeing their reactions and how much they enjoyed it.”  “It was definitely unexpected, and it makes you feel really good when you can do something for that age group especially,” said Wood.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Cummins Foundation joins other industry partners and IUPUI to support iDEW program for IPS high school students  July 7, 2015  Students at Arsenal Technical High School, part of Indianapolis Public Schools (IPS), are receiving an investment from Fortune 160 company, Cummins Inc (NYSE: CMI). To improve learning opportunities for students from low-income and minority families and provide more pathways to good jobs, the company is investing its resources as well as the skills of its employees.  The IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI announced today Cummins Inc. is donating funding and encouraging its employees to contribute their time and talents to the Informatics: Diversity-Enhanced Workforce initiative, or iDEW.  Launching this fall, iDEW will help students from Arsenal Technical, IPS’ Pike High School and the private Providence Cristo Rey learn information technology (IT) skills necessary for two or four-year college degrees and careers in the IT industry.  The iDEW program has broad support from area businesses, with the global power leader Cummins being the most recent investor. As part of the partnership, Cummins employees can use four or more hours of their work time to mentor and tutor iDEW students.  “Cummins employees are excited to support iDEW and help students in Indianapolis’ Near Eastside reach their full potential in education and beyond,” said Mary Chandler, Cummins’ Executive Director of Corporate Responsibility. “Cummins is grateful for the opportunity to partner with IUPUI and other industry partners committed to helping students in our community gain skills that lead to good jobs.”  iDEW is a year-round program that introduces students to computing, informatics, and other IT concepts, the real-world application of those concepts, and career opportunities in the IT industry, which according to one IU executive is lacking in both diversity and quantity of qualified applicants.  “There are over 1.4 million unfilled jobs in the IT industry, and the number continues to grow,” said Mathew Palakal, executive associate dean of the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI. “These jobs are high-paying and available all over the United States. We feel a sense of responsibility in assisting with the preparation of the workforce of the future by providing them with the necessary skills to secure these jobs.”  To prepare graduates for those future careers, iDEW will focus on students’ reading, writing, and interpersonal communication skills in addition to building their self-esteem, confidence, and ability to work on teams.  Leading those sessions, which range from basic programming to creating websites and mobile applications to understanding the data behind DNA, will be Informatics and Computing faculty working with high school teachers. Lending a hand will be volunteers from industry experts like Cummins.  Headquartered in Columbus, Ind., with a growing presence in Indianapolis, Cummins designs, manufactures, and distributes engines, filtration, and power generation products. In 2016, Cummins’ Distribution Business will open a downtown Indianapolis office, increasing the number of employees in the city to approximately 250. Corporate Responsibility is a core value at Cummins, and employees are encouraged to serve and improve the communities in which they live, with partners and programs like the iDEW initiative through the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## $494,286 NSF grant to improve work compensation technologies  September 12, 2017  A $494,286 National Science Foundation research grant awarded to Professors Lynn Dombrowski and Davide Bolchini at the Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI will enable worker-centered design of workplace information systems and applications—improving transparency, collaboration, and the accuracy of compensation in traditionally low-wage industries.  [Lynn Dombrowski](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/lynn-dombrowski/)  [Davide Bolchini](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/davide-bolchini/)  An estimated 40 million American workers are employed in low-wage occupations such as farm work, custodial work, child care, and restaurant services. The research grant, Designing Collaborative and Transparent Work Information Systems, will address how the design of workers’ time reporting systems and other technologies can decrease long-standing problems surrounding wage discrepancies and compensation labor laws in these environments.  It is a critical area affecting more than 10% of the workforce. Yet workplace information systems have not been explored from the perspectives of low-wage workers and their managers. “Low-wage workers have quite a bit of experience and interaction with technology. However, they are not part of the design processes for the technologies that impact them,” says Dombrowski, assistant professor of human-computer interaction and principal investigator for the three-year research study.  “We are excited about this new research project funded by the highly-competitive NSF Cyber Human System program, and I’m very proud of Dr. Dombrowski for her role as principal investigator,” says Bolchini, co-PI on the grant, and associate professor and chair of the Department of Human-Centered Computing. “This research is an example of how cutting-edge design research methods in human-centered computing explore and help address difficult problems of important societal relevance. Where market forces are not yet ready or willing to go, it’s our role as researchers to dive deeper.”  In a pilot study, Dombrowski found that approximately 75% of low-wage workers have some system of documenting their time. But most of these systems are either personal documentation methods or company systems that don’t accurately record employee work histories and performance. As a result, lost wages and benefits plague employees in these industries, and employers often face costly wage-theft lawsuits.  “We understand that people may be unaware of what their legal rights are, and managers may be unaware of what their legal obligations are,” Dombrowski says. “We can build tools that help everyone understand the potential violations.” Human-centered design of workplace systems can improve communication, understanding, accountability, and equitability across the board, she says. “Technology has provided us the opportunity to rethink what we understand about our working relationships, allowing us to design systems that are beneficial for all.”  Dombrowski, Bolchini, and the research team will draw on workers’ real-life experiences, which include how well workers and their managers understand compensation and benefits laws. The team will design new technologies that address these issues—and ultimately serve as models for workplace compensation technologies across many industries.  “Often, when we think about technological innovation, we think about technologies arising from Silicon Valley, which are focused on people who have resources,” Dombrowski says. “Technological innovations for low-wage workplaces address problems that matter, versus addressing problems make someone’s life a little bit better. This is a space where we can drastically improve people’s ability to work together toward happier, healthier working lives and businesses.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## MAS senior Tavien Gillard finds his ultimate artform in video production  October 14, 2022  Tavien Gillard originally began his time at IUPUI in the Liberal Arts program pursuing Journalism and now is majoring in Media Arts and Sciences with a concentration in Video Production and Sound Design . The now senior made his decision after talking with friends.  “I chose Video Production because I believe film is the ultimate artform. It’s an intimate union of composition, lighting, blocking, everything. My framing is my canvas and the lighting is my brushstroke. It is also one of the most challenging artforms because you need to master people. I could talk all day about the work. Maximum escapism. Visceral. Surreal. I want to push the medium farther,” Gillard says.  [Video Production and Sound Design](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/undergraduate/media-arts/video-sound/)  While attending school, the RJE Knoll Scholar also works as a Media & Branding Specialist for Faith Hope & Love (FHL) Community , a catalyst for change through the engagement of community relationships. A big focus of FHL is on the development of Missional Neighborhood Centers, places where food pantries are developed so that individuals can receive faith based support as well as food. FHL is always about doing more than bags of food,” he says. As a Media & Branding Specialist, Gillard works primarily as a Documentarian. He ensures that the outreach work is captured—that video interviews, their large events, and other initiatives that FHL hosts are documented.  [Faith Hope & Love (FHL) Community](https://www.fhlcommunity.org/)  A typical day for Gillard at Faith Hope & Love involves Media Specialists running around with cameras capturing another Food Pantry opening, interviews with neighborhood figures, or recording an event, such as their annual Golf Classic. The remainder of the week’s hours are spent in the FHL “war room” planning their next media release in a meeting or at home “in front of the warm glow of the computer monitor, Premiere Pro chugging away.”  Gillard found his internship on what was the Jag Jobs (now Handshake) website. The listing posted asked for someone who was experienced with video content development, capable of working independently, could travel, and work in a team setting. He believes he got this position because of his resume, which talked about places that he has traveled to (foreign countries) , a previous job position that he had as a Communications Assistant, and his ability and willingness to grow as an intern.  “Career-wise, my work with FHL has been sort of like a benevolent video game passive. I believe that due to my work with Faith Hope & Love, I’ve been consistently building up a portfolio, consistently building connections, consistently growing my workplace and communication skills, and consistently learning how to balance workloads between both school and work, which may prove instrumental later on in my career,” he says.  Gillard says he has also met plenty of important individuals including politicians and other community leaders, and their engagements have aided him in solidifying relationships with important people in Indianapolis. He says, “I don’t care what position level you’re at, everyone should be trying to solidify more relationships. I don’t mean connections; like genuine relationships with individuals that can further you as a person.”  After graduating, Gillard plans on taking a breather for at least a few months, travel a bit, maybe move from Indiana. After that he plans to seek contract work or other employment. “I’ll worry about my plans for graduating when it gets closer. I don’t know what the beast looks like yet so I can’t plan to fight it. I really hope to get involved in the art scene more,” he says.  “I believe that there’s a huge narrative about job security, especially if you’re pursuing something art-related,” Gillard says. “There’s a huge narrative about how replaceable you are in the grand scheme of the industry’s engine. I’ve met plenty of students and have plenty of friends who are terrified of not being employed after working so hard to get a degree. I’ve been in class with professors that reinforce that very fear.”  Gillard’s advice to other students is that if you’re looking for an internship, you need to set standards for yourself. You shouldn’t take a position that doesn’t pay you enough or work in an environment that isn’t what you want because you feel like you need to due to that fear. Bottom line is, you don’t.  “There is a position waiting on you either now or in the near future that can put you on your own personal path to success. People should refine their skills and seize the opportunity as soon as it presents itself. If it’s not here yet, work on developing your confidence and your portfolio. Refine your vocabulary because employers love big words and people that seem sure of themselves. Walk into that interview with the knowledge that you will be okay if you don’t get the internship.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Informatics student Keegan Briskey part of winning Tech SOS Challenge team  December 20, 2021  The pandemic changed summer internship and job plans for many college students, among them Keegan Briskey, a junior majoring in informatics at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI. The Techpoint S.O.S. (Summer Opportunity for Students) Challenge  was created to support over 500 students across Indiana in summer 2020 and was continued this year. Techpoint S.O.S. 2021 consisted of a six-week project where students were coached by industry professionals and worked together in interdisciplinary teams to complete a task in one of five categories: healthcare, sports and entertainment, education, Indiana agriculture, and sustainability.  A total of eleven students from the School of Informatics and Computing took part this year; last year, HCI graduate student Ravi Teja Jorigay was part of a winning team that developed the NoQ app that streamlines the onboarding process for the air travel industry. This year, Lou Lenzi, a Professor of Practice at the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI and Jonathan Huer, EdD, Chief Learning Officer at Eleven Fifty Academy, developed and facilitated the business and technical curriculum respectively alongside the team at Elevate Ventures.  [NoQ app that streamlines the onboarding process](https://techpoint.org/2020/08/techpoints-s-o-s-challenge-yields-promising-solutions-to-problems-created-by-covid-19-pandemic/)  [Lou Lenzi,](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/lou-lenzi/)  Briskey got involved in the challenge when he realized he needed a new experience and wasn’t able to get a traditional internship. His group comprised of five students from different universities worked to integrate blockchain into the healthcare system. They designed their winning iOS application called “UnID” that transferred sharing controls for medical data to the user. Briskey explained that this approach is a contrast to the current system where healthcare institutions store and manage the data, including vaccination records, procedure results, and so on. The group took their cue from leading companies that are shifting the right of data privacy to users, ie, patients, to create something that felt natural for a new generation of healthcare technologies.  [iOS application called “UnID”](https://devpost.com/software/unid)  Briskey reached out to two of his informatics professors, Fawzi BenMessaoud and Travis Faas , to ask questions as the group was researching blockchain and deciding on deliverables. He also found core programming concepts from his classes were helpful to working with Swift programming language. Noting that he had never coded in that language before, he decided to take on learning and implementing it as a personal challenge.  [Fawzi BenMessaoud](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/fawzi-benmessaoud/)  [Travis Faas](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/travis-faas/)  He highly encourages others to consider the Tech S.O.S. Challenge if it is offered again. “The people you will interact with at TechPoint are fantastic, inspiring, and professional—shoutout to Joe Perin and Moe (Maurice) Simmons at TechPoint. The wonderful team at TechPoint will help you learn how to be more independent and encourage you to improve your skillset with a direct application to something in-industry,” Briskey said.  Briskey chose to study at the School of Informatics and Computing because of his love for computers, people, and creating special connections between them. “I knew I was ready for something more technical after high school and wanted to learn more about how I could strengthen my programming skills so that I could pursue a software development career,” he said. After graduation in December 2022, Briskey hopes either to work as a software developer for companies involved in self-driving operations using machine learning and data science or as a database engineer.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

The certifications added to the Next Level Jobs initiative are medical coding , multi-device development, and applied information science/data studies . They will be offered as part of the initiative in the spring semester.  [medical coding](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/minors-certificates/medical-coding-certificate/)  [multi-device development,](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/minors-certificates/development-certificate/)  [applied information science/data studies](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/minors-certificates/info-science-certificate/)  Next Level Jobs provides Indiana residents with free training for skills that are needed for in-demand, high-paying jobs in growing industries.  [Next Level Jobs](https://nextleveljobs.org)  “Informatics is now a fast-emerging discipline, encompassing many high-demand career paths in virtually every industry that uses technology and data to make lives better. All three of these School of Informatics and Computing certificate programs are part of the growing field of informatics, and we are pleased that they will help many more Hoosiers improve their prospects for well-paying career opportunities,” said Mathew J. Palakal , senior executive associate dean of the School of Informatics and Computing.  [Mathew J. Palakal](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/mathew-palakal/)  The multi-device development certificate is being offered in an online bootcamp format where students complete an 18-credit certificate in one semester. This is the first bootcamp-style certificate program at IUPUI. Students can graduate with an accredited college certificate or continue their studies to earn a Bachelor of Science degree in media arts and science. The certificate will prepare students to enter the workforce in web and mobile application development.  Medical coding is critical for the timely flow of medical data. The program requires 28 credit hours over two semesters. Earning the certification could lead to careers such as a benefits coordinator, documentation and coding specialist or medical biller.  The applied information science/data studies program teaches students to manage data, develop digital competencies and build database infrastructures. Those who complete the 18-credit-hour program could be hired for jobs such as a data project manager, market research analyst and logistics analyst.  “Being a Next Level Jobs training provider is a sign of IUPUI’s commitment to innovation and access. There is a growing demand for shorter and less expensive pathways to a credential from both traditional freshmen and adult students wanting to reskill. The IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI has the right faculty and the right programs to meet this demand,” said Taylor Dooley , associate director of undergraduate recruitment for the School of Informatics and Computing. “By partnering with the Next Level Jobs program, we also hope to reach more first-generation and underrepresented students who have been left out of higher education.”  [Taylor Dooley](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/taylor-dooley/)  Students who have a high school diploma and have completed less than an associate degree could be eligible to complete one of these certificates at no cost, Dooley said.  The state’s Workforce Ready Grant will pay for tuition and mandatory fees for the approved certificate programs for up to two years. If a student takes 12 credits or more, they will be charged the banded rate and full tuition and mandatory fees will be covered, said Lisa Bridgewater, associate director in IUPUI’s Office of Student Financial Services.  To qualify for the grant, according to Next Level Jobs, students must:  The Workforce Ready Grant is considered a last dollar award and is added after other gift aid.  The exception is anyone with the GI Bill or other related military awards, which do not count towards gift aid.  The School of Informatics and Computing is the first school at IUPUI to have certificate programs tied to the state jobs initiative. IU Southeast also has a medical coding certificate in the initiative.

    "body": "  ## Liu receives NIH R01 grant to develop new computational methods for proteoform identification  October 9, 2020  Xiaowen Liu, associate professor of bioinformatics at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, has received a 4-year, $1.26M award from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for his project entitled, “Computational tools for proteoform identification by top-down data independent acquisition mass spectrometry.” This is the second time Liu has received a highly competitive and prestigious R01 grant from the NIH. He will collaborate with faculty from The Ohio State University, Michigan State University, and the Indiana University School of Medicine on the project.  Proteomics, the study of proteins expressed by an organism, tissue, or cell, includes the exploration of proteoforms—protein products with various primary structure alterations resulting from biological processes such as gene mutations, alternative splicing, and post-translational modifications. These functional variants are implicated in many types of diseases, from Alzheimer’s disease to cancer, and understanding them is critical to developing new targeted therapies and treatments.  Top-down mass spectrometry (MS) is the method of choice for identifying proteoforms. Data dependent acquisition (DDA) and data independent acquisition (DIA) are two main approaches in top-down MS. Top-down DDA MS produces a relatively low number of proteoform identifications and misses those in low abundance. Top-down DIA MS can increase that number but is seldom used due to high complexity of data and lack of efficient data analysis tools.  Liu’s project will develop new computational methods and is expected to yield the first open source software suite for high-throughput, top-down DIA-MS data analysis.  Liu says, “Because of the complexity of top-down spectra, software tools designed for interpreting bottom-up MS data cannot be directly used for proteoform identification by top-down DIA-MS. We will design new dynamic programming algorithms and machine learning models for solving the problem.”  It is anticipated that the proposed tools—predictive models and algorithms—will be routinely used by researchers in the top-down proteomics community to facilitate identification and understanding of proteoforms and their functions. The software will make significant contribution to the annotation of gene and protein sequence databases and the development of proteoform databases.  Sarath Janga, interim chair of the Department of Biohealth Informatics, notes that “although several groups have built tools for analyzing RNA sequencing data, relatively fewer efforts have been laid out to develop robust software to accurately identify and map protein forms in humans and other model systems. Hence, Dr. Liu’s efforts at building these much needed tools would significantly advance our understanding and annotation of the human proteome to facilitate development of therapies directed at specific proteoforms.”   ### About the NIH R01 Grant  The Research Project Grant (R01) is the original and historically oldest grant mechanism used by NIH.

Regardless of whether you work in academic, public, school or any other type of library, library professionals are asked to design and facilitate learning. However, many MLIS professionals express that they did not take any courses that prepared them to design, teach, and facilitate learning experiences. LIS-S577 helps students to conceptualize what learning is, analyze how learning happens outside of school, and prepare students to intentionally design and facilitate different types of learning within information institution settings. In this course, students extend beyond what they know about outcome-based learning frameworks that are often used in formal learning settings (i.e., schools) to apply diverse theories and methods of learning used in informal learning settings. As a culminating project, this course requires students to design informal learning experience (i.e., library programming, field trip, in-class activity) and facilitate them with real human subjects and analyze their own facilitation through interaction analysis. Also, students will engage in iterative design cycles to revise the informal learning experience they designed. In this process, students will share successes, mistakes, growth and reflect on their identity as a facilitator.   ### Program Learning Goals Supported  Instructors map their courses to specific LIS Program Goals . Mapped program goals drive the design of each course and what students can expect to generally learn.  [LIS Program Goals](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/masters/mlis/program-goals.html)   ### Learning Outcomes  Instructors develop learning outcomes for their courses.

    "body": "  ## MacDorman explores voice preferences for personal digital assistants  March 30, 2017  Alexa, Siri, Cortana—Why are so many personal digital assistant (PDA) voices female?  This trending question about gender in PDAs is frequently directed to Professor Karl MacDorman , associate dean for academic affairs and associate professor of human-computer interaction at the Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI.  [Professor Karl MacDorman](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/karl-macdorman/)  MacDorman and his research team have examined​ preferences for gender in synthesized voices, studies that are part of MacDorman’s broader research in human perceptions of humanness in social robots. ​In a study published in Computers in Human Behavior —​ “Does social desirability bias favor humans?” —​the data showed that women and men expressed ​explicit preference for female synthesized voices, which they described as sounding “warmer” than male synthesized voices. Women also preferred female synthesized voices when tested for implicit responses, while men showed no gender bias in implicit responses to voices.  [Computers in Human Behavior](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2010.09.002)  [“Does social desirability bias favor humans?”](http://macdorman.com/kfm/writings/pubs/Mitchell2010DoesSocialDesirabilityBiasFavorHumans.pdf)  Widely sought out for his expertise on artificial intelligence and human-computer social desirability bias, MacDorman has often been quoted on the subject, most recently in articles in the Wall Street Journal , Reader’s Digest , Geekwire , and Wired .  [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/alexa-siri-cortana-the-problem-with-all-female-digital-assistants-1487709068)  [Reader’s Digest](http://www.rd.com/magazine/why-siri-sounds-female/)  [Geekwire](http://www.geekwire.com/2016/why-is-ai-female-how-our-ideas-about-sex-and-service-influence-the-personalities-we-give-machines/)  [Wired](https://www.wired.com/2015/10/why-siri-cortana-voice-interfaces-sound-female-sexism/)  MacDorman’s research suggests that device designers should be aware of reinforcing gender stereotypes. “The use of implicit measures to detect social desirability bias could provide designers with information that more completely explains user preferences and better predicts user behavior,” MacDorman said.  With better information, designers can create machine voices that are more appealing to users, which would benefit the design of interactive voice response (IVR) systems, socially assistive robots, and countless applications of human-machine interaction.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## $1.59 million grant funds computer science workshops to train public school teachers  May 24, 2021  (originally published May 24, 2021 by IUPUI Newsroom, Kirk Johannesen, reporter)  The IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI is using a two-year, $1.59 million grant from the Indiana Department of Education to offer a variety of free workshops to train Indiana public high school and middle school teachers who are passionate about expanding computer science in the classroom.  The summer Computing by Design Teachers Training Program is being offered to more than 300 Indiana educators over the next two summers. Starting this fall, Indiana law will require computer science coursework to be offered in all Indiana schools.  “Having computer science taught across grade levels and schools provides Hoosier students greater access to this growing, problem-solving field,” Indiana Secretary of Education Katie Jenner said. “As schools across the state have expanded their computer science offerings, partners like the IU School of Informatics and Computing have played an important role in training our educators to prepare our students with the skills and knowledge needed for the future.”  The Computing by Design program, launched in 2019, prepares teachers to be able to offer computer science classes at their schools. Last summer, the first year the workshops were offered, 112 teachers participated.  “The need for professional development in computer science continues to rise quickly,” said Jim Lyst, a School of Informatics and Computing faculty member and curriculum lead of the Computing by Design program. “At the same time, the unique context for every teacher and school demands an adaptable pathway to preparing successful coursework. This year, we are offering several workshop options for teachers to choose from, regardless of their background and experience in computer science.”  Computing by Design, also known as CxD, is a professional development experience for teachers in all instructional areas who are expected to teach courses or offer activities in computer science. The program curriculum has been successfully implemented through the school’s popular Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce Program, now running in eight high schools. Participants will be taught by School of Informatics and Computing faculty, focused on developing lesson plans in computer science that follow a Computing by Design-based teaching and learning format.  “The key innovation and the tremendous success of the Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce Program has been developing and implementing the CxD curriculum in teaching computing concepts in high school computer science classes,” said Mathew J. Palakal, senior executive associate dean of the School of Informatics and Computing. “This approach instilled interest — specifically in IT, and in STEM broadly — among high school students. We are excited that the IDOE has recognized the CxD approach as being a successful model to adopt and expand to school teachers in Indiana who are engaged in teaching computer science classes.”  Offerings include:  Six programming workshops (trivia, chatbot, robot, video game, internet of things and data visualization). An innovation workshop. A project-based-learning 101 workshop. Six cross-discipline workshops with projects that blend computer science into business, language arts, math, art and more.  While the workshops will be largely conducted online, allowing for greater flexibility of time, regular live Zoom meetings will be scheduled and materials, including videos, will remain available after the workshops for further self-guided review. Teachers will have access to School of Informatics and Computing faculty for remote technical assistance during the training and throughout the academic year using a web-based workspace.  In addition, standalone computer science activities for all grades, but with an emphasis on kindergarten through Grade 8, will be developed during the summer and through next year and made available online.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## NEWM-N 507 Digital Media for Healthcare  3 credits   ### Description  This course examines how healthcare systems employ digital media for marketing, education, communication, and ecommerce. Students research digital media usage in the healthcare industry and work in teams to design and execute an empirical research project culminating in a publication or online interface with digital media elements.  As Web 2.0 and mobile technologies mature, healthcare systems in the US and abroad have employed digital media for marketing, patient education, ecommerce, interactive communication, and so on. This course provides graduate students and undergraduate students an opportunity to research digital media usage in the healthcare industry. Students develop a project based on extensive empirical research on the needs of hospitals and patients: either (1) writing an empirical research paper or (2) developing a research-based, user-friendly online interface with digital media elements, such as video, audio, interactivity, for a patient portal, a hospital intranet, a healthcare insurance network, an independent patient education website, a healthcare social media website, or another kind of healthcare-related endeavor. The possibilities are broad in this digital territory. You simply need to find a niche that suits your interests. A niche can refer to a kind of hospitals, for instance, children’s hospitals online, a disease type, such as diabetes and digital support, a media type, such as patient education videos, or a device type, such as iPhone app for supporting bipolar disorder patients. The students work together in teams and work closely with the professor either on a paper or on a production project. The students are expected to publish with the professor or produce a new media/HCI project under the guidance of the professor.  The course will mainly take on the seminar format. For those who write a research paper, they will go through literature search and review, instrument design, sampling, data collecting, data analysis, and write-up. For those who will work on a project, they will read the assigned literature, search for more literature, survey the industry, survey the niche market, design a prototype, conduct a user test, and refine the design.   ### Learning Outcomes   ### Policies and Procedures  Please be aware of the following linked policies and procedures.

    "body": "  ## Luddy MAS video alumni win Spotlight Award at Heartland’s Indy Shorts International Film Festival  September 27, 2023  Matt Spear  (photos provided by Matt Spear and Devin O’Connell)  Media Arts and Science (MAS) alumnus Matt Spear initially went to IUPUI thinking he would go into engineering, but his first semester he was undecided. During that time, he found out about a program at Luddy Indianapolis that specializes in video production and immediately was interested. “It was something I had always been interested in but never seriously considered for a career until coming to IUPUI and learning about the Media Arts and Science program,” Spear said. Fast forward to 2023, when Spear and fellow MAS alum Devin O’Connell were honored at the Indy Shorts International Film Festival for their film, ‘Love, Grandma’.  [Indy Shorts International Film Festival](https://www.heartlandfilm.org/indyshorts)  “My time at SoIC (now Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering, Indianapolis) was such an influential period of my life. Having project-based classes was an incredible learning experience. At the time there was a group of students that all seemed to take the same classes so being able to build those relationships and collaborate and work with people on class projects that had the same interests as you made for a great time and some fun projects. Thomas Lewis always created an incredible learning environment and always created an atmosphere that encouraged trying new things and taking risks. Learning in that way is incredibly valuable. My Capstone project that I did with my now wife was an awesome experience. Thomas Lewis was our capstone professor, and that short, Three Months, went on to be selected to play at Heartland Film Festival.  [Thomas Lewis](https://luddy.iupui.edu/contact/profile/thomas-lewis)  I remember getting the notification we were selected while sitting in a Mathew Powers ‘ class, took everything in me not to stand up and shout in excitement!  [Mathew Powers](https://luddy.iupui.edu/contact/profile/mathew-powers)  After graduating in 2014, Spear got into the freelance market as a Production Assistant working primarily on commercials. He did that for a couple years before working his way into the camera department where he continues to freelance mostly as a 1st AC but also doing Cam Op and DP work. “‘Love, Grandma’ was my first narrative passion project since graduating. It was an incredible experience to be able to work with so many talented friends that work across multiple departments to bring this together. Now that this project is done, I would love to work on a feature,” Spear said.  Devin O’Connell  Devin O’Connell’s story nearly parallels Spear’s. When he first came to IUPUI, he had declared a major in nursing. After one semester, he switched to ‘undecided’. Another semester passed before he discovered Media Arts and Sciences, in which he was primarily interested in web development. O’Connell took one video production course and realized that he had a passion for telling stories. He graduated from IUPUI in 2018 with a BS in Media Arts and Science focused on video production and a minor in Film Studies.  During his senior year, O’Connell started actively working in the freelance film and TV industry in Indianapolis on various commercial, corporate, documentary, reality, and narrative projects. He found himself working in many different roles on set including as a production assistant, assistant director, grip, camera operator, 1st assistant camera, and director. He says typically the way he gets hired is by a producer or production manager calling and seeing if he is available for an upcoming shoot; most work is passed along by word of mouth.  Outside of working as a crew member on large budget productions, O’Connell enjoys working on passion projects with the friends that he has made in the industry. The year after he graduated, he made a short experimental movie on 16mm film called ‘The Fear of Living’, which was another project that Matt Spear and he collaborated on; him as the director, Spear as the director of photography. Over the last couple of years, O’Connell has been producing and directing commercial projects in order to build a demo reel in the hopes of getting more directing work. In 2021, he produced and directed a short fashion film called ISOLATION that went on a festival run and picked up some awards. Recently, he started a full-time position producing video content for a freight logistics company in Indianapolis called Spot. In his free time, he still writes scripts and currently has a couple of short narrative film projects in production.  “As someone who greatly benefits from experiential learning, I just enjoyed being given the opportunity to make films. I had never made a film or even cut together a video prior to starting my major so it was exceptionally helpful to be allowed to make all the ‘beginner mistakes’ and learn from those mistakes,” O’Connell said.   ### On receiving the Spotlight Award  “Indy Shorts is an incredible festival, and we are lucky enough to have it in our back yard,” Spear said. “Just getting in is an honor as they have about a 4 percent acceptance rate. It is also one of a small number of festivals in the world that is an Academy Award qualifying festival. We are incredibly honored and excited to receive the Indiana Spotlight award from such an amazing festival. It feels good to be recognized for your work, but even more so to me it feels good for the cast and crew that put in so much time and effort to get that recognition, without those incredible people I am lucky enough to call friends, this would only have lived in my head as an idea.”  O’Connell said, “Matt and I were hoping for a local festival to accept Love, Grandma and, fortunately for us, one of the best local festivals for short films selected our project. That alone felt special, but winning the Indiana Spotlight Award was something else. I have always thought that the film was great and deserved recognition, so I think this award really validated that feeling.  “Now we are waiting to hear back from many more festivals where we can hopefully collect some more accolades. Outside of that we don’t really have plans for further promotion of the film. We each have more projects that we are looking to move on to shoot. It’s sort of a never-ending cycle of filmmaking.”   ### Partnering to make ‘Love, Grandma’   #### Writer and director  This short comes from his own personal experience with his grandma, Spear said. “This particular day is one that had always stuck with me, and I would think about often. I had wanted to do a short for a long time but never knew what type of story to tell. During a brainstorming session with my wife where we each wrote down as many ideas as we could think of in 20 minutes, one of the ideas I wrote down was about my experience with my grandma. From there it developed into what finally became ‘Love, Grandma’. In developing it I wanted to stay as authentic and true to my own experience as possible. This short to me feels more like a recollection of my own memories than anything else,” he said.  One of the very first things Spear did was write out what he remembered from the day and the things that had stood out to him.  After writing out his memories and experiences from the day, he began putting it into script form. Once the draft was completed, he began looking up visual references for the tone and look he was after.  “The first major hurdle me and my producer faced was a location. I was after an older looking home that looked like something your grandparents might have lived in in the 90’s. I really wanted the home to have wood panel walls and a midcentury look to it. We looked for months to try to find the right house. Either they didn’t fit the description, or they were unavailable for us to use for various reasons. It got to the point where I was ready to settle for a location that wasn’t perfect, but we could make work. Thankfully my producer encouraged me not to settle because the location is so important to the story and overall look of a film. Thankfully he did that because we ended up with the house in the film and I think it works perfectly for what we set out to accomplish with it.  “While we were location hunting and working through that we were also casting and locking in our crew. Casting was all done through Talent Fusion, a local talent agency. They were incredible to work with and couldn’t be happier with the cast we got for our short. They were great to collaborate with a lot of fun to have on set with us.  “We knew this was going to be an art-heavy short so that was the first department we worked on getting in. Aly and Taylor, our art department, did an incredible job at bringing the vision to life. I told them grandma aesthetic in the 90’s and couldn’t be happier with what they did with the set design. The house had to be emptied of all the decoration and furniture that was in there and they brought in everything you see on camera, from the chairs and couches to the candy and glass bowls on the coffee table.  “The actual shoot days went really smoothly. As usual we did get a little behind and had to cut some shots from the schedule. But the days went really smooth. It was cramped in that house with around 30-40 cast and crew crammed inside, but we made it work and had a great time!”   #### Producer  “I think Matt had written the script back in 2019 or 2020 and he had shown it to me sometime shortly after it was finished,” O’Connell said. “I had always thought that it was a good idea worth pursuing but Matt and I had never formally sat down and talked through what it would take to get it from script to screen. In late 2021, I had put together a commercial demo reel that I was happy with and when I started to think of what to do next, I remembered Matt’s script. Typically, when Matt and I work together as creative partners on a project, I fill in my desired role as a director and Matt in his desired role as a director of photography. But this story was just too personal to Matt for me to try to direct so instead, I told Matt that I would act as the film’s producer.”  O’Connell said having a producer on a project is really such a great thing because producers, or production managers depending on the size of the project, usually are the ones who handle a lot of the logistical needs. If someone were to ask questions like, where are we shooting? When are we shooting and how long is the day going to be? Where are we getting actors and equipment from?, the producer would be the one to ask. This position doesn’t really have a specific definition. Some producers have creative control, some are on a project for specific scenes, and some producers seem to be doing nothing on a project – and occasionally that is the case. But for “Love, Grandma’, O’Connell wanted to step into this producer role in order to allow Spear some freedom to focus on the story and the look of the film. “It can be challenging when you are trying to decide on the feel of a scene, and someone comes up asking where the bathroom is,” O’Connell said.  The house location for ‘Love, Grandma’ is owned by a friend of theirs, Mike, in Noblesville. Mike and his wife Tawni were kind and allowed them to completely remove all the furniture from their living room in order to bring in their own set decorations that fit the era of their film, the 1990s. Every piece of furniture and little tchotchke you see in the film was meticulously placed by their very detailed art department. And the restaurant scene was filmed at Mama Carolla’s in Broad Ripple. “It was incredibly kind of the owners to allow us to film a part of our project there,” O’Connell said.  Casting the film was made easy by connecting with a local talent agency, Talent Fusion. “The owner, Scott, was especially helpful when we found ourselves without our grandma actress at 10PM the night before the first day of shooting. Our actress had a medical emergency (she’s perfectly healthy now) and wasn’t sure if she would be released from the hospital in time to be on set the next morning. I immediately got on the phone and was able to get in touch with Scott who stopped what he was doing to find us an actress. While we waited to hear back from him, Matt and I were on the phone, debating on whether to cancel the shoot and push it to another week. Luckily, Scott was able to find someone who was available for half of the day which worked for our schedule,” O’Connell said.  When it comes to finding crew for these types of passion projects, O’Connell said he first looks to friends to see if anyone is willing to help. “Fortunately for Matt and I, our friends make up some of the most talented professionals in the area and they span across all departments. Because of this, the shooting days went smoothly, and we were able to quickly transition into post-production. The editor for the film, Will Wertz, did a phenomenal job and after we filmed a quick day of pick-up shots, the film was complete. A few final touches like creating an IMDB page for the film, and having a poster designed (credit for the poster design goes to IUPUI Herron alum Sara Frucci!) were all that was left before submitting to film festivals,” he said.   ### Parting advice to future filmmakers  Spear offered this advice to those following in his footsteps: “Take advantage of the time you have in school to work on your craft. Having an environment where you can try new things and seek advice from your professors and peers is so valuable. Continue making things, every project is lessons learned that will help as you grow in your career. And network! Getting out there and meeting people and connecting with professionals in the field is vital to a successful career.”  O’Connell added, “For anyone interested in pursuing filmmaking I would recommend refining your networking skills. Finding work in the film industry almost entirely comes from word of mouth. Plus, if you want to make your own projects, it helps to be able to communicate to people in a clear and concise manner. Some of that networking includes setting up awkward meetings over coffee with strangers, but going out of your way to make those meetings happen will make you stand out as someone who is willing to go above and beyond. Also, keep making stuff. Practice the skills of filmmaking in every project, even if they feel insignificant. It pays off in the long run. Also, over prepare during pre-production, but be prepared for that entire plan to fall apart in a moment. And, finally, my most important advice is to bring an extra pair of socks.  “God, does that feel good to change your socks after being on your feet all day.”     ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

The day-long event called Passport to Hi-Tech , was open to all ages but was targeted to girls ages 7 to 12. It featured interactive exhibits and hands-on experiments designed to inspire girls to learn more about careers in STEM fields such as informatics, engineering, biology, chemistry, manufacturing, computer science and others.  The school presented two activities to those in attendance at the interactive history park. One activity was dubbed “Ready, Set, Compute!” Participants jumped into computing and became a working part of a machine in a fast-paced game that showed what a computer did as friends played a game on it. When the players selected a move, volunteer students would race to the CPU or other parts of the simulated device to deliver a signal for action, showing what goes on in a computer game. The other activity demonstrated a Finch robot, a small, two-wheeled robot with bird-like features. Polly Baker, Ph.D., a professor of media arts and science in the Department of Human-Centered Computing, programmed the robot so it could be controlled with hand gestures, which provided the opportunity for those walking by to interact with technology.  “The robot is approachable, and young people see they can control it,” said Vicki Daugherty, a school recruiting specialist. “It’s empowering. They say to themselves, ‘Hey, I can do this.’”  Passport to Hi-Tech was organized by Women & Hi-Tech and Conner Prairie.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

BioMap is an attempt to create a scalable knowledgebase of biological relationships extracted from vast amount of biomedical literature data. The development of BioMap system addresses several innovative research issues related to knowledge discovery from literature documents and real-time, interactive access of this knowledge. Specific problems that are being investigated are: discovering explicit , implicit and directional relationships among biological entities from abstracts and full text documents; discovering both explicit and implicit protein-protein interactions and computationally validating these interactions; and, obtaining novel pathways associated with specific diseases in question. Protein-protein, gene-protein, disease-drug interactions are examples of biological associations that are automatically discovered from large number of literature documents. BioMap can discover interactions in user specified biomedical problem domains such as inflammatory diseases, regenerative biology, cancer, etc., and provide a user-centric view of the knowledge that are discovered.  Intelligent Information Management Systems: There is a critical need for innovative information management and knowledge discovery tools to sift through vast volumes of heterogeneous data from various information sources. This project looks into developing Intelligent Software Systems that can integrate information resources and extract embedded knowledge from these information sources.   ### Related News "

The games are an interactive element of the Museum’s exhibition “Amazing Maize: The Science, History and Culture of Corn.” The games are being promoted through the Museum’s Twitter and Facebook sites.  Educational material about corn appears as the player moves through a corn-maze game. Mid-point in game, players are taken to a matching game where they select images of the types of corn available the United States. Savage and Hardin used the skills gained in the Media Arts and Science program to produce a “real world” product while serving the State Museum. The “Amazing Maize” exhibit traces the 10,000 year genetic evolution of corn. It highlights the scientific, economic and cultural significance of corn on daily life, past and present.     ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Regenstrief investigator named first chief editor of exam to prepare clinical informaticians  December 7, 2012  INDIANAPOLIS — Regenstrief Institute investigator John T. Finnell, M.D., M.S., associate professor of clinical emergency medicine at the Indiana University School of Medicine and director of health informatics at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, has been named the first chief editor of the Clinical Informatics Practice Board Examination.    The practice board examination will help prepare physicians to take the initial American Board of Medical Specialties examination required for certification as subspecialists in clinical informatics.  The Clinical Informatics Subspecialty Certification Exam Preparation Program is being developed by The American Medical Informatics Association.  Clinical informatics is the interdisciplinary field merging medicine and computer science that focuses on the secure collection, organization and application of patient data to improve health and the delivery of health care to individuals and populations. This is the first time a subspecialty certification will be applicable to physicians from all 24 medical specialties.  Board certification guarantees that a doctor has met basic competency. Included within these criteria are a number of years of training, accreditation of training programs, licensing and sub-specialty certifications.  “Patients expect their physicians to have passed these requirements in order to deliver quality health care,” said Dr. Finnell, who is a graduate of a National Library of Medicine-funded informatics fellowship program at the Regenstrief Institute. “Hospitals and health care systems will expect their medical information officers to have met these standards as well. The practice exam will allow physicians to prepare for the first and subsequent certification exams.”  Clinical informatics was designed as a new physician medical subspecialty by the American Board of Medical Specialties in 2011, and the first examination in the field will be administered in fall 2013. The practice exam, to be available in early 2013, will be composed of about 200 multiple-choice questions.  For nearly half a century, Regenstrief physician clinical informaticians have been recognized for their use of data to improve the quality of care, increase the efficiency of health care delivery, prevent medical errors and enhance patient safety.  “Health care requires doctors to generate and manage huge quantities of information, so it’s about time that clinical informatics was recognized as a formal medical specialty. Dr. Finnell has worked for many years in the Wishard Health Services Emergency Department and as an information scientist and educator for IU and the Regenstrief Institute,” said Regenstrief Institute President William Tierney, M.D., associate dean for clinical effectiveness research at the Indiana University School of Medicine and chief of medicine at Wishard. “His broad experience will assure us that the practice board exam in clinical informatics will be both practical and complete. Those who take the practice exam will be well-prepared to take and pass the real board examination.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

Hayes, MPA, MLS, ’14. Hayes is currently the founding leader of the Center for Black Literature and Culture (CBLC) at the Indianapolis Public Library and a graduate of the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI library science master’s program .  [Movers and Shakers](https://www.libraryjournal.com/?page=movers-and-shakers-2021)  [Center for Black Literature and Culture](https://www.indypl.org/locations/central-library/center-for-black-literature-and-culture)  [library science master’s program](https://luddy.iupui.edu/lis/master-library-science/)  Andrea Copeland , Ph.D., department chair and director of the Library and Information Science master’s program at the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, says of Hayes, “I am thrilled to see Nichelle’s ongoing contributions to the advancement of the profession acknowledged in this way. The department is grateful for the mentoring she provides to our students and for her support in creating the Wilma Gibbs Moore Endowed Graduate Fellowship, intended to increase representation of persons of color within the profession. Congratulations and thank you!”  [Andrea Copeland](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/andrea-copeland/)  In her five years at CBLC, Hayes has been instrumental in highlighting the culture and accomplishments of the African Diaspora to the Greater Indianapolis community, from welcoming 2000 people to the opening to becoming a third place—aside from work and home—for informal and formal gatherings.  Hayes sees the library as more than just books, offering access to information via classes, databases, computers, and e-resources that benefit the community. “Libraries are especially beneficial for the youth in our community; a place to research, learn and grow.  Best of all, the resources are FREE to community members. Libraries are an amazing ROI—return on investment,” she says.  Hayes’ service to the Indianapolis community began as a teenager at her local church and Girl Scout Council.  But she says her most important contribution has been spotlighting the importance of Black Indianapolis to everyone in the community and partnering with organizations, giving them space for programs. She is incoming president of the Black Caucus of the American Library Association (BCALA) in 2022 and is currently serving as vice president of that organization. Her future plans include increasing the number and prominence of Blacks in the library profession on an international level.  To others considering a career path in librarianship, Hayes says, “For our profession to progress and thrive we must immediately change our trajectory. We need to embrace, support and encourage the inclusion of historically excluded groups into our profession. We cannot adequately serve populations that we don’t represent without those lived experiences.  Seek out the history of Black, Indigenous, People of Color—BIPOC—library luminaries such as Effie Lee Morris, Dr. E.J. Josey, Thomas E. Alford Sr., BCALA Founders, as well as Dorothy Porter Wesley and the first Black librarian in the state of Indiana, Lillian Childress Hall.”     ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Community sponsors bring in $125K to iDEW program  January 24, 2017  The R.B. Annis Educational Foundation and the Cummins Foundation recently announced continued investments in the Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce (iDEW) program. Both organizations have financially supported the workforce development program in the past, and Cummins has donated the time and talents of its employees.  [Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce (iDEW)](https://luddy.iupui.edu/idew/)  Striving to address a dearth of underrepresented minorities in the field of informatics, the iDEW program provides year-round, state-accredited, dual-credit elective technology courses in three Indianapolis high schools. High school students in the program benefit from many classroom and extracurricular activities, as well as from industry and college student mentors.  Designed and administered by the Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI—in partnership with many corporations and community organizations—the iDEW program is in its fourth successful semester, with 225 students from Arsenal Technical, Providence Cristo Rey, and Pike high schools.  Students receive a problem- and project-based curriculum designed and taught by faculty from the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI. The program prepares them for exciting, in-demand careers in information technology.  R. B. Annis made a $75,000 gift to support iDEW, bringing its total program investment to $150,000. The foundation’s late founder, Robert B. Annis, was an alumnus of Arsenal Technical High School. Board members Wayne Weber and Dan Yates said that Mr. Annis would have been proud to see this program implemented at his alma mater.  Cummins doubled its last iDEW investment with a gift of $50,000 to support student mentors in the classroom. Jane Richardson, IT strategy and optimization leader at Cummins and iDEW advisory council member, said that when she and Sherry Aholm, VP and CIO at Cummins, visited the iDEW classrooms, the participants most appreciated and valued the undergraduate informatics students who mentored them in their classes. The company’s employees have been among the most active volunteers in the iDEW classrooms and helped coordinate a summer field trip to Google and Cisco in Chicago.  There is a growing number of unfilled, high-paying jobs in the IT industry. The iDEW program inspires students and provides them with the skills needed to secure employment. The program also increases diversity in the IT workforce, as 80 percent of program participants are underrepresented minorities and women. Such opportunities would not be available to students without the critical financial support and expertise from organizations like the R.B. Annis Educational Foundation and Cummins.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## School of Informatics and Computing unveils plans for IUPUI gaming arcade for research and learning  April 12, 2010  The IU School of Informatics and Computing announces plans for IUPUI’s first gaming arcade for undergraduate student research and experiential learning. Referred to as the Media Arts Research and Learning Arcade (MARLA), the facility will provide a creative learning community for students interested in 2D and 3D game design, animation and game strategies. It is expected to open later this year on the fourth floor of the School of Informatics and Computing in the Informatics and Communication Technology Complex.  MARLA gives students access to a professional-level game studio, library and gallery equipped with the latest in gaming technology. Under the mentorship of faculty and industry pros, students will have the ability to design, build and test their own games among peers. Students will also work alongside faculty engaged in ongoing research, including the development of “serious games” for education, health care and energy conservation.  The MARLA game library will include classic books and gaming consoles, as well as a gaming archive. Everything from an Atari, to a Nintendo 8-bit system, to a modern X-box 360 will be available to play and test any game. Text collections on programming, animation, lighting, texturing, rendering, camera movements and other gaming-related subjects will be available for student research and study.  A game gallery within MARLA will serve as a space where students and faculty can display newly-developed games and animations, as well as concept and narrative game visualizations. MARLA could potentially serve as an incubator where entrepreneurial students can grow and spin off their own gaming and animation businesses.  Dr. Anthony Faiola, Executive Associate Dean of the School of Informatics and Computing, created MARLA as a unique means of building community while also strengthening the school’s commitment to gaming and IUPUI’s RISE initiative. Faiola worked with faculty from the school’s Media Arts and Science program to refine plans and pursue funding. The project was recently awarded a Learning Environments Grant from the Center for Teaching and Learning. Faiola hopes to bring MARLA to life for fall 2010.  An animation of the future MARLA space can be found on YouTube at www.youtube.com/iuinformatics.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

The event will feature a presentation of a $150,000 grant provided by JPMorgan Chase to support the initiative.  The iDEW program will teach information technology skills to local high school students to prepare them for academic and future career opportunities in the IT industry. It will engage 90 high school students from three area high schools — Pike, Arsenal Tech and Providence Cristo Rey — through a year-round enrichment program that will help them progress toward earning four-year college degrees.  The initiative consists of learning engagement modules focused on familiarizing students with core informatics and computing concepts, showcasing real-world application of those concepts, and introducing career opportunities. The learning modules have an overarching and interactive theme of “Computing for Social Cause.”  “Careers in information technology offer high-wage employment opportunities and yet more than 35 percent of these jobs go unfilled in Central Indiana,” said Al Smith, chairman of JPMorgan Chase Indiana.  “JPMorgan Chase is excited to partner with Indiana University’s School of Informatics and Computing to pilot a program that allows high school students to earn dual college credit and industry-recognized credentials in this field and encourage diversity of the IT workforce.”  The iDEW initiative will also help students elevate their overall academic performance, including:  “We feel a sense of responsibility in assisting with the preparation of the workforce of the future,” said Mathew Palakal, executive associate dean of the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI. “There are over 1.2 million unfilled jobs in the IT industry, and there is an estimation of 39% will go unfilled by 2020. These jobs are high-paying and available all over the United States. We want to ensure the success of these high school students by inspiring their interest in informatics and computing and providing them with the necessary skills to secure these jobs.”  With additional support from the R.B. Annis Foundation, the Care Group, and Old National Bank, the iDEW initiative will begin in the fall of 2015 with its first learning modules.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## I-LLDS program and fellows from IU’s Schools of Library Science celebrated  November 1, 2022  On October 29, librarians from all over Indiana celebrated the Indiana’s Librarians Leading in Diversity (ILLID) program as a part of Indy Public Library’s Center for Black Literature & Culture (CBLC) 5th Anniversary.  Established in 2008 with funding from the Institute of Museum and Library Services by the Indiana State Library and (then) Indiana University School of Library and Information Science, the I-LLID program supported the recruitment and education of 31 fellows representing underrepresented communities in library and information science with the goal of increasing diversity in Indiana’s libraries. Now, approximately 10 years since the final cohort completed graduate studies, they are celebrating the work of the program coordinator, Marcia Smith-Woodard, I-LLID fellows, and all who supported the project.  Nichelle Hayes, founder of the CBLC, is an alum (3rd Cohort) of the I-LLID program.  Without the I-LLID program Hayes says she might not have been fortunate enough to join the profession and follow her passion of Black literature and information dissemination. She offers special acknowledgement to Kisha Tandy (1st Cohort). I-LLID opened the doors of learning and networking that Hayes is still benefiting from.  During the Fellowship program she had the support of other fellows as well as the opportunity to meet established professionals and attend conferences. Dr. Jean Preer was an IU professor who had a deep impact on her, she says.  Tandy, who is Curator of Social History, Indiana State Museum and Historic Sites, says “As an I-LLDS fellow, I gained greater research skills that have helped me in my role as a museum curator. The research tools are transferable in various work environments.”  The celebration event featured: • Panel discussion with I-LLID fellow leader and fellows, moderated by, Dr. Nicole Cooke, Augusta Baker Endowed Chair, School of Information Science University of South Carolina • Premier of a video highlighting I-LLID and fellows • Recognition of fellows • Keynote talk, Let this Radicalize You: Re-Envisioning LIS from Dr. Nicole Cooke, begins at 3 PM • Call to Action for next iteration of I-LLID and fellowship time  Andrea Copeland, associate professor and chair of the Department of Library and Information Science at the Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, said, “When I first joined the faculty at IUPUI, it was the first year of I-LLID program, and I had many of the fellows in my courses, reference, public library management, introduction to research and readers advisory. We had so much fun learning together! The fellows brought a lot of new energy and helped to create an inclusive environment in the program, which made all the difference to me, as an outsider to the Midwest. I’ve loved watching the contributions they’ve made to the professional, truly leaders, in the state of Indiana and beyond.”  Kristi Palmer, I-LLID mentor and dean of the IUPUI University Library, said “I have witnessed the impact of the work and ideas of I-LLID fellows on both local communities and national library and cultural heritage professions.  Tremendous talent held by individuals who shared a common experience of mentorship, professional development, networking and cohort-enriched coursework.  What’s more, many fellows are now employing their professional expertise to lead, to mentor new professionals, and to inform the next iteration of Indiana’s Librarians Leading in Diversity.  They are setting the bar for professionalism.”   ### About I-LLID  In June 2008, the Indiana State Library and the Indiana University School of Library Science (IU SLIS) at Indianapolis announced receipt of a $1 million grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services for recruiting and educating 30 ethnically/racially diverse students for Indiana’s Librarians Leading in Diversity (I-LLID) Project. The following organizations have pledged their support to the success of the project: The State Library Diversity Advisory Council (DAC);  Administrators and Directors of Large Public Libraries in Indiana (ADOLPLI); Academic Libraries of Indiana (ALI) ; Indiana Black Librarians Network (IBLN); Indiana Library Federation (ILF); and Indiana Special Libraries Association (InSLA).The fellowships were designed for individuals from diverse backgrounds who have been traditionally underrepresented in the library profession. This opportunity will enable them to pursue the Master of Library Science Degree to be equipped to join the professional library workforce in Indiana.  By accepting the fellowship, the students are obligated to successfully complete the MLS with a minimum 3.0 Grade Point Average. They will be required to work in an Indiana library for at least two years upon graduation. Fellows have been linked with experienced library professionals as mentors and resources. Some fellows have been or are currently working or volunteering in various types of libraries, museums, or historical societies. Their presence as working professional librarians will help Indiana libraries to better serve their diverse populations.  After four rounds of applications, 31 fellows were recruited for the project. Twenty-one fellows chose the IU School of Library and Information Science (SLIS) campus in Indianapolis (IUPUI) and ten chose the Bloomington campus (IUB). Two cohorts of ten fellows were recruited from August to October, 2008 and from February to April 2009; From June to August 2009 seven fellows made up the cohort. A final class of four fellows was recruited from December 2009 to February 2010. There were 70 applicants for the 31 fellowship spots. Of the successful candidates, 25 were Indiana residents and 6 fellows were from out-of-state. The first class of fellows began classes in January, 2009 and the final class began in May 2010. Twenty-nine of the 31 fellows successfully completed the program.  The fellowship included tuition payments for up to 36 hours of the Master of Library Science (MLS) Program. Additionally, some travel and conference expenses were paid and the fellows received a monthly stipend for up to 16 months. They were engaged in the IU SLIS learning community on both the Indianapolis and Bloomington campuses. The students learned from professionals near and far and worked together to establish camaraderie within and among the cohorts.  The I-LLID Project coordinators and supporters sought opportunities to expose the Indiana library community to these fellows as potential employees, co-workers, and future library leaders. The project ran from September 2008 through August 2012. The fellows are working in academic, public, school, and special libraries, and independently. Look for them around the state and in the national library news.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Over 700 Registered for Inaugural MOOC Hosted by the Library and Information Science Department  April 28, 2015  The Department of Library and Information Science at IUPUI launched the campus’ first massive open online course (MOOC) using canvas.  The free, four-week course, “Are You Experienced? Exploring Public Libraries,” was open to anyone anywhere. Persons interested in the course were encouraged to register in advance, but registration continued after the class began.  The course covered four topics, one each week: the “Customer Service and the User Experience,”  “Youth Librarianship: Best Practices to Serve our Youngest Patrons,” “Technology: Improving Library Services by Managing Technology,” and “Community Engagement,” said Andrea Copeland, an assistant professor in the department, who developed the course, and taught the Community Engagement section.  “Given the central role of information technology in libraries and the transition of the Master of Library Science to an entirely online program, creating the MOOC was a natural step for the department,” Copeland said, “and the fact we are located in the School of Informatics and Computing, it just made sense.”  “Our degree is open to a national audience in a way that it was never before,” she said. “The library community is national and international and I thought this would be a good way to let people know we’re here and what we’re really good at.”  One of the department’s strongest areas is public libraries, Copeland said.  “The course is a digital open house where people can, at no cost, and with as much energy as they wish to expend, learn about our program and what’s going on in public libraries.”  An equally important goal is to explore the feasibility of using the online site for the course for professional development of Hoosier librarians.  About half-way through the four-week session, there were 764 people enrolled from all over the United States, and countries like Spain, Lithuania, and Costa Rica among others. The majority of those who registered for the course are librarians, who will be eligible to receive 12 educational credits from the Indiana State Library as part of the required continuing education classes, others are learning about the Master’s in Library Science (MLS) as a degree option or about librarianship as a career.  The course featured instructional video as well as resources to read, explore and view. Using Canvas Learning Management System (LMS), allowed participants to customize their learning experience. They had freedom to work at their own pace, and had the option to participate in weekly discussions, take quizzes on the week’s lectures and readings, and work on an optional project.  “We really are thrilled with the response. Since this was the first MOOC for the campus, we weren’t sure what to expect. We are pleased with the outcome and look forward to working with the Indiana State Library on future opportunities, as IU’s technology infrastructure is a valuable asset,” said Rachel Applegate, chair of the library and information science department at IUPUI.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Akinmboni and Jacobs honored as IUPUI Top 100 students  April 4, 2017  Two students from the IU School of Informatics and Computing—Adetoun Akinmboni and Cade Jacobs—were honored on March 31 at the 2017 IUPUI Top 100 Students awards ceremony.     ### Adetoun Akinmboni  A junior majoring in informatics with a minor and specialty in business, Adetoun Akinmboni has a truly impressive academic record that is matched only by the many ways she supports and educates her campus community through participation and leadership.  Women in Technology (WIT), Students and Technology in Academia Research and Service (STARS), IUPUI Undergraduate Student Government (USG)—for these groups and more, Adetoun has been a tireless and inspiring member and ambassador.  Originally from Nigeria, Adetoun founded the SOIC (School of Informatics and Computing) International Club, which supports international students through cultural experiences, academic activities, and career opportunities. She is a senator for the IUPUI African Student Association (ASA), where she’s also a dance team leader. She is also a student ambassador for IUPUI and for the IUPUI Office of Student Employment.  For her excellence in academics, she has received many recognitions, including the Stefan S.Davis Regatta Scholarship, the Robert E. Cavanaugh Scholarship, the Health Informatics Scholarship, and the Turner Wright Scholarship.  “While coming to America, my mom told my brother and I that we would be residing in Indiana, so I started researching schools,” she says. “I fell in love with IUPUI because of the diversity and the downtown location.”  The IUPUI campus and the Indianapolis community have been lucky beneficiaries of this love. A high school student mentor through the Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce (iDEW), she regularly works with students at Pike High School in Indianapolis, helping them with projects involving trends in technology such as the Internet of Things. She also volunteers to mentor young girls at local Girl Scouts technology workshops.  Adetoun credits her success to many people at the School of Informatics and Computing. Among those that have helped her along the way are Professor Louie Zhu, Academic Advisor Julie Reagan, Career Specialist Stephanie Marshall, and Diversity Coordinator Vicki Daugherty.  Likewise, faculty and staff credit the success of programs and activities to Adetoun. “Ade is such a joy to work with,” says Daugherty. “She has the successful combination of being thoughtful and determined. Her ability to achieve her goals benefits all of us.”     ### Cade Jacobs  “I think my education can be summed up entirely in three words: The Shirley Technique,” says Media Arts and Science senior Cade Jacobs, whose remarkable contribution to the field of maxillofacial prosthetics via 3-D sculpting and printing changed the life of patient Shirley Anderson —the technique’s namesake. Anderson’s digitally sculpted mandible represented a breakthrough in the applications of 3-D technology to health care.  [changed the life of patient Shirley Anderson](https://luddy.iupui.edu/news/story/zeb-wood-3d-prosthetic)  When Dr. Travis Bellicchi from the IU School of Dentistry approached School of Informatics and Computing Professor Zebulun Wood to help him create the largest facial prosthetic ever created at a dental school, Wood entrusted his student, Jacobs, with the design and construction of a prosthetic too cumbersome in size to be created by traditional materials and methods.  [Zebulun Wood](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/zeb-wood/)  Since then, Cade has worked with the IU School of Dentistry and the IU School of Medicine on similar projects for approximately 30 patients. Jacobs says his undergraduate experience has been devoted to developing and perfecting the method. “Once I began working and doing research on the adaptation of media arts to patient care, nothing else mattered to me,” Jacobs says.  For these achievements, Cade is the recipient of the highest student research honor on the IUPUI campus—the 2017 Chancellor’s Award for Outstanding Undergraduate Research. “Cade is one of our first students to steer his skills in digital design and 3-D animation toward health care and helping people heal. Currently Cade is refining a patent-pending method he co-created for 3-D printing molds for patients who need prosthetics, burn masks, and radiation bolus,” Wood says. “Cade is an artist, an inventor, and at heart, a researcher.”  A regular on the Dean’s List, a member of the IUPUI Honors Program, and a familiar face in student organizations, Cade has served as chapter president of IUPUI SIGGRAPH, and has volunteered as a student mentor for high school students at Summer Workshops at the School of Informatics and Computing. He traveled to Poland on an IUPUI International Scholarship and volunteered for Your Life Your Story, a Latino high school summer camp, teaching adversity training through digital art.  Cade has already secured employment with Online Resources Inc., where he works as a service engineer doing high-accuracy 3-D laser scanning, photogrammetry, and structured light scanning for reverse engineering and metrology purposes. He is grateful to have landed in a job that he loves. And he credits it all to his experiences here.  “IUPUI is a magical place,” Jacobs says. “Without the university and the School of Informatics and Computing, I would not be half the man I am today.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Impact of Indiana’s opioid epidemic demonstrated through film by IUPUI faculty  July 31, 2019  [Original article written by Kelsey Cook. Published with permission.]  C. Thomas Lewis understands the power that video and filmmaking can have in addressing social issues. In 2015, he traveled to Kenya on a New Frontiers grant to film a series of short narrative films on confronting the stigma associated with HIV that is still being used in schools today.  [C. Thomas Lewis](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/thomas-lewis/)  “There is a real power in storytelling to address social issues and help people get beyond things like stigma,” said Lewis, a senior lecturer of video production in the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI. “This power has really captured my imagination and has me wanting to see how I can use video production and concentrate my creative efforts to work with communities in dealing with health issues.”  It was in Durban, South Africa, at the International AIDS Conference in the summer of 2016 that Lewis had a truly profound moment. He attended a presentation about the current state of AIDS worldwide, and he never expected to see Austin, Indiana — a Scott County town of just over 4,200 people greatly affected by an HIV outbreak and the opioid epidemic — included.  “Of course, I knew what was happening in Austin, but to see it in that context blew my mind,” Lewis said. “I knew in that moment that my next project wouldn’t be around the world — it would be in my own backyard.”  With that goal in mind, Lewis and Kyle Minor, associate chair and associate professor of English at IUPUI, applied for and received a grant through the IUPUI Arts and Humanities Institute that enabled them to tell the stories of the people and communities affected by the HIV outbreak and opioid epidemic in Indiana.  “This funding enabled us to work collaboratively with students and community partners, and we’ve been hard at work ever since,” said Minor, who serves as script writer and producer. “In working on this project, I’ve come to learn how much I didn’t know about opioid use disorder and have cultivated a great compassion for those whose lives are impacted by it.”  Their project, highlighted on the Opioid Stories website, grew beyond the initial plan of using only narrative, scripted stories as Lewis had done in Kenya. The site also includes recovery stories and long-form interviews with individuals offering different views on the issue and sharing various paths to recovery. Two documentaries are also being produced, including “ The Long Run ,” a documentary about Wes Doty, who found recovery through running.  [Opioid Stories](http://www.opioidstories.org/)  [The Long Run](https://vimeo.com/312575023)  Three scripted films are in the works, with the second currently in production. Each is set in Scott County, and Lewis and Minor have worked hard to build trust within the community by meeting with locals who support the project and want to tell their stories. In the second film, nearly every character was cast from the county’s recovery community.  “The real story to me is that we’re working so closely with a local community to tell their own stories,” Lewis said. “Without that local support, this project wouldn’t happen, and we would be working on a totally different project.”  IUPUI students are also instrumental in the development and creation of the Opioid Stories content, with a team of two to four students signing up for independent study with Lewis each semester to help work on the project.  “Students are our creative and technical partners from start to finish,” Minor said. “They serve as line producers, camera assistants, sound recordists, editors, grips and production assistants.”  Lewis believes it is important for students to realize the many opportunities that exist for young filmmakers to apply their talents to engage with community issues — something that he has been able to show by example.  “If we can put a human face to the issue, so people can relate emotionally to the stories we produce, that’s a huge step toward combating stigma,” Lewis said. “We have come face-to-face with people involved with the crisis, devastated by it and recovering from it, and that has been really powerful and inspires me to keep moving forward.”  With so much work done and underway, Lewis and Minor are also looking ahead to the future. They plan to continue adding recovery stories and interviews to the Opioid Stories site, but they also want to begin outreach efforts in other communities working to address the opioid crisis.  “My whole hope is to make these films and then find funding that will allow us to take them around the state, where we can have panel discussions that use the films as motivation for opening up conversations about various issues surrounding opioids in Indiana communities,” Lewis said.  Lewis appreciates that he was able to find this niche at IUPUI, using a creative approach to serving the community, for both himself and his students.  “It’s important for our IUPUI community to take our talents, apply them to something bigger than ourselves and create a social impact,” he said. “Through a model of participatory filmmaking, I show students how their video skills can engage the community around an issue and incite positive change.”  This project reflects Indiana University’s extensive expertise and research regarding addictions. To build on this area of strength, IU President Michael McRobbie, along with Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb, and IU Health President and CEO Dennis Murphy, announced the Responding to the Addictions Crisis Grand Challenge initiative in October 2017.  This Grand Challenge initiative engages a broad array of IU’s world-class faculty as well as IU’s business, nonprofit and government partners. The initiative aims to implement a collaborative, applied and comprehensive plan to reduce deaths from addiction, ease the burden of drug addiction on Hoosier communities, and improve health and economic outcomes. This statewide initiative is one of the nation’s largest and most comprehensive state-based responses to the opioid addiction crisis — and the largest led by a university.  [Grand Challenge initiative](https://grandchallenges.iu.edu/)  Kelsey Cook is associate director of research communications in the Office of the Vice President for Research at IUPUI.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## School of Informatics and Computing launches Midwestern Conference on Health Games  September 16, 2010  Interactive health games – using popular gaming consoles, the web and mobile technologies – have emerged as effective tools in the future of healthcare and education, and a new regional conference based at IUPUI hopes to help establish Indiana as a leader in this growing field.  The first-ever Midwestern Conference on Health Games, scheduled for October 29 at the IUPUI Campus Center, will gather medical researchers, academics, IT professionals, multimedia experts and other leaders from Indiana and surrounding states to explore how healthcare is rolling out the fun and games to encourage healthy behaviors, prevent disease, improve overall care and drive down medical costs.  Meredith Golomb, M.D., M.Sc., of the IU School of Medicine’s Department of Neurology will serve as keynote speaker. Other participants include researchers and entrepreneurs from IU, IUPUI, University of Indianapolis, University of Michigan, University of Wisconsin, Wright State University, Bloomington-based Wisdom Tools, Inc. and NYC-based Kognito Interactive, LLC.  The conference hopes to spark collaborations, interdisciplinary learning and potential new business enterprises and investments that could benefit both Indiana’s academic and economic environments. Entities like the Health Games Research program and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation have invested millions nationwide in the continued research and development of health games.  Also known as “serious” games, health games apply interactive technologies to a variety of medical objectives, including educating diabetics on how to manage their condition, helping smokers kick the habit, fighting childhood obesity and maintaining cognitive ability in Alzheimer’s patients and senior citizens.  The conference is sponsored by the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI with support from the Games for Health Project. The conference is an extension of the research in which many of the school’s faculty is already engaged, including conference co-chairs Anna McDaniel, Ph.D., RN, FAAN, and Hadi Kharrazi, M.D., Ph.D. They see informatics as the cross-disciplinary bridge that makes healthy outcomes through gaming possible.  “Researching, developing and testing a successful health game really involve people with a broad set of skills. Of course, they have to understand the medical or clinical side of the equation. But they also need the computing and technology skills to program the game,” said Kharrazi.  “But even still,” added McDaniel, “they need the digital media and interface design expertise to know what makes a great game that people want to play, whether it’s just for fun or for health education too. Informatics is what really brings this all together.”  For more information, including location, programming and how to register, please visit www.midwesthealthgames.org. Early-bird registration rates are available through October 1. Students may attend for only $10.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Bolchini receives National Science Foundation award to create Research Experiences for Undergraduates  June 22, 2012  Davide Bolchini, Ph.D., assistant professor of human-computer interaction at the School of Informatics and Computing, was recently awarded a second supplemental grant by the National Science Foundation to create Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) within his NSF-funded project “Navigating the Aural Web.”    By continuing the successful REU edition of Summer 2011, the REU project is funding the integration of two undergraduate informatics students into Bolchini’s human-computer interaction research team during the 2012 summer term. The students Lindsay Kaser and Callie Archibald are working hands-on in co-designing and testing novel ways in which we can navigate a website while on-the-go by listening to its content instead of continuously looking at the screen. Such application prototypes are also enabling low-vision and visually-impaired users to navigate the web via simple vocal commands instead of waiting for long lists of links to be read by existing technologies for web accessibility.  “I’m really glad to have this opportunity because undergrads rarely have the chance to work on research,” said Archibald, who plans to become a medical researcher.  “This has been a great opportunity because it’s rare for undergraduates to participate in and be exposed to this kind of research,” Kaser said. “I will be pursuing my master’s in human-computer interaction this fall, and I feel the REU has been very valuable in preparing me for the program. Working with Dr. Bolchini and his talented group of students has been quite a rewarding experience.”  For more information about Dr. Bolchini and his work, visit http://mypage.iu.edu/~dbolchin/   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Library and Information Science grads win grants to do great things  December 13, 2018  Lindsey Walters will graduate this month from the IU School of Informatics and Computing with her Master of Library Science degree, but she has already made a big impact at the Elkhart school where she works as a media specialist. Walters found out in October that she had been awarded a $20K grant by the Elkhart Education Foundation to create a Learning Garden at Mary Beck Elementary School.  [Master of Library Science](https://luddy.iupui.edu/lis/master-library-science/)  Walters remarked on the beauty of the school grounds, but noted nothing had been done in the courtyard space in years, so she pursued a grant to secure the funding. “Our students need more access to hands-on gardening and nature in order to better understand how to raise crops and see where their food comes from. Students and teachers want to build a community garden in the library courtyard in order to take the classroom outside,” Walters wrote in her proposal.  The Learning Garden will have four different zones: a sensory garden, for teaching the life cycle and supporting students recovering from trauma; a butterfly garden, in support of curricula on pollinators and wildlife habitat; a food garden, where students can plant, tend, and harvest their own flowers and food; and a learning zone—an outdoor classroom for activities and experiments.  Walters says they are in the planning stage with the grant; they have met with the landscape architect and are drawing up the plans this winter. In the spring, they will start building and planting, and should have a fully operational garden by the time school starts again in fall 2019.  This is not the first grant the former high school English teacher has received on behalf of her employer. Last year, she was able to garner $2500 for a maker space that is used for monthly family events. The key to all this? Walters is a master of grant writing, according to her peers in the library profession. And it is paying off for her students.   ### Grant writing serves needs and dreams  Walters says that libraries and schools have had to learn how to market themselves in today’s world. With funding always being an issue in both worlds, it is imperative to find creative ways to get more funding. By writing and receiving grants, schools are able to take learning to the next level with more hands-on learning, field trips, problem/project based learning, and new technology. “The grants we receive make a huge difference in our kids’ lives by exposing them to things they otherwise would never see or experience,” she says.  Elsa Kramer, associate faculty in the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, since 2012 has taught the S591 Grant Writing class that Walters took. Kramer says that libraries and other information organizations have long relied on private funding sources and public charities to support projects and programs. “Since the 2006–09 recession, philanthropic funding has been essential for libraries to meet their basic mission as well as to innovate and experiment with new technology. There are so many different types of resources, and the competition for them is so strong, that expert search skills are required.”  [S591 Grant Writing class](https://luddy.iupui.edu/courses/lis-s591/)  In her class, Kramer stresses the importance of quantifying the extent of a problem and finding authoritative data or evidence that supports the project rationale. She believes it is essential to write with the grant maker’s perspective in mind. “It’s easy and fun to identify an organizational need and propose a plan to address it, but the grant writer must also demonstrate how meeting that need will have impact tied to the grant maker’s mission.”  Kramer has an undergraduate degree in writing, to which she added a Library and Information Science (LIS) master’s degree from IUPUI as well as a master’s in public administration. She points out that information science is broadly applicable with meaningful work opportunities in all sectors and subject areas. Graduates are leaders in schools, public and academic libraries, archives, museums, government agencies, and numerous corporate settings.  “As the world has become aware of the value of data and its architecture, access, storage, and security, the importance of the MLIS degree is better understood. Whether graduates work in bricks-and-mortar libraries or in other information settings, as I do, our roles as researchers, data managers, and educators of information users are more visible today and thus more highly valued. An MLIS graduate with funding knowledge will be even more valuable in the job market,” Kramer says.  Numerous other former students have done exactly that, successfully applying their grant writing skills. For example, Vincci Kwong, now head of library web services at IU South Bend, received a Library Services and Technology (LSTA) grant to launch an e-reader checkout program for the IUSB campus. Julie Wendorf, director of the Crown Point Community Library, won a $76K grant to fund a program to reach underserved citizens in her library’s service area. Another soon-to-be LIS graduate, Megan Williams, head of the Greentown Children’s Branch of the Greentown Public Library, just received funding for a project involving iPads and Dash robots for the school-public library hybrid located at Eastern Elementary.

    "body": "  ## MacDorman finds that virtual humans appear to influence ethical decisions in gender-specific ways  May 14, 2010  Virtual humans are increasingly taking on roles that were once reserved for real humans. A study co-authored by Karl F. MacDorman, Ph.D., with the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI explores how appearance, motion quality and other characteristics of computer-generated characters may impact the moral and ethical decisions of their viewers.  The research, published in the June 2010 issue of the journal Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments , found that the decisions of men were strongly affected by presentational aspects of the simulated woman, while women’s decisions were not.  “Much evidence has accumulated showing that nonverbal behavior can have a profound impact on human judgment in ways we are hardly aware of and this research extends that work to the digital realm. This work demonstrates that presentational factors influence people’s decisions, including decisions of moral and ethical consequence, presumably without their realizing it,” said MacDorman, an associate professor in the Human-Computer Interaction Program at the School of Informatics and Computing.  In the study, a simulated female character presented participants with an ethical dilemma related to sexual conduct and marital infidelity. The character’s human photorealism and motion quality were varied in four ways. The changes had no significant effect on female viewers, while male viewers were much more likely to rule against the character when her visual appearance was obviously computer generated and her movements were jerky.  “Although it is difficult to generalize, I think the general trend is that both men and women are more sympathetic to real human characters than to simulated human characters. So I think the women were mainly influenced by the moral dilemma itself, and they may have felt more empathetic concern for the character, because they could better imagine what it would be like to be in the same situation,” said MacDorman.  The fact that males and females react differently to changes in a character’s visual presentation could impact the design of future systems created to facilitate medical decision-making, crime reenactments and many other scenarios.  “The ‘human interface’ is the most natural interface for us to use for communication, because it is the interface we know best. There are many potential applications for simulated human characters as a communication interface. As we come to a better scientific understanding of how nonverbal behavior can be used to influence people without their knowing it, we will also need to consider how it might be exploited by humans who create virtual characters,” said MacDorman.  “If it is used to manipulate people into taking a course of action they might not otherwise take, such as buying more products or adhering to medical or behavioral advice, that clearly raises ethical concerns. Technology should not be used in ways that diminish human autonomy,” MacDorman concluded.  This study was funded by an IUPUI Signature Center and Research Investment Funds grant. A future study with a simulated male character is planned.  Co-authors of “Gender Differences in the Impact of Presentational Factors in Human Character Animation on Decisions of Ethical Consequence” in addition to MacDorman are Joseph A. Coram, M.S.; Chin-Chang Ho, M.S.; and Himalaya Patel, M.S. from the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Bioinformatics Faculty Member Awarded Research Grant to Study Vascular Calcification in Chronic Kidney Disease  March 31, 2014  Assistant professor in the Department of BioHealth Informatics, Dr. Sarath Janga, was the recent recipient of the IU Collaborative Research Grant by the IUPUI Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research.    Dr. Janga, principal investigator, along with co-investigators Dr. Sharon Moe/Dr. Neal X. Chen from the IU School of Medicine was awarded $69,550 for a one-year grant beginning April 2014, that will be used for research to gain a better understanding of the role of microRNA as a mediator of vascular calcification via the transfer of microRNA to adjacent cells.  “This project will provide valuable information that will aid in the prevention and cure of chronic kidney disease which is estimated to affect more than 15% of the US population,” said Dr. Janga.  Vascular calcification is a prominent finding in aging, diabetes, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and inflammatory diseases, which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Although several risk factors have been identified in CKD, the greatest risk factor for progression is the magnitude of existing arterial calcification. However, the mechanism of such propagation is unknown, and data suggest it is far more complex than physicochemical changes in mineral concentrations.   In this study, Dr. Janga and his team will examine the contribution of miRNAs in regulating the vascular calcification progression in chronic kidney disease, using integrated experimental and systems biology approaches.  IU Collaborative Research Grants are designed to facilitate and support outstanding research and discoveries by teams of experts who have not worked together previously.  The grants also are intended to support research which will significantly advance a research field and in doing so, impact the lives of Indiana residents, the US and the World.

Davide Bolchini, assistant professor, Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, was lead author of the paper, published in the journal Bioinformatics.  Usability is a new field in bioinformatics and is a “very unexplored area so far,” Bolchini told Genomeweb, an online news source for integrated informatics, which re-printed the paper’s finding in its newsletter BioInform.  According to BioInform writer Vivien Marx, Bolchini and his team used \"state of the art\" usability evaluation methods to examine an online repository of proteins, noting that scientists often encounter \"breakdowns\" when browsing through different sub-systems of the repository that are updated at different times.  The result often leads to obsolete content, according to the research team.  The study unfolded during Bolchini’s post-doctoral fellowship from 2007 to 2008 with University College London computer scientist Anthony Finkelstein and colleagues, who were “applying usability methodologies and usability inspection and other evaluation methods to improve the quality” of bioinformatics applications, according to Bolchini.

Two courses taught in the Summer 1 session, 3D Prototyping and Articulation and Augmented Reality, taught students about how different aspects of 3D are being used in business situations.  With the prototyping course, taught by MAS lecturer Zeb Wood, students were able to visit the Caccia Custom Cars design facility to see the newest prototypes in progress and how three-dimensional design turns into real world speed.  Albert William, also a lecturer in the MAS program, helped by scanning the hood ornament concepts with a state-of-the-art 3-D scanner, creating an actual 3-D model of the hood ornament. Caccia hopes to reveal the car this coming fall at various car shows.  Those students also got to visit Indy’s only 3D-Printing ‘Maker’ community, CLUB CYBERIA, to see what is available to makers to assist them in their creative exploration via a 24/7 membership.  Students taking part in the school’s first Augmented Reality (AR) class, taught by Wood (3D Design) and MAS lecturer Travis Faas (Development), were tasked with creating their own AR applications for Apple and Android devices.  Students developed applications ranging from educational applications to portfolios, to interactive ways to experience commercial architecture.  “The class was a completely collaborative experience combining knowledge from students in both development and 3D design backgrounds. We came out with some great projects,” said Wood.  In addition to the highly unique class experience, the class visited the Indianapolis Museum of Art (IMA) to discuss new ways to plan exhibition design. Their focus was incorporating technology to enjoy, educate, and make art memorable in a whole new way for all age groups of IMA’s audience. Hopes are to foster a lasting relationship with IMA so that more opportunities can be created for students to make an impact on the world around them.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Isabel Lopez, IUPUI LiFT Scholar, takes part in highly selective i3 program  April 21, 2020  Informatics student Isabel Lopez was chosen from a nationwide pool of applicants for the iSchool Inclusion Institute, a 20-month-long experience that began in the summer 2019 and will conclude spring 2021.  Lopez, a LiFT Scholar at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, traveled to Pittsburgh for a four-week session of classes and professional development in June and July, 2019, where she was part of a 25-person cohort. She then worked throughout the year on a team project about social media, which was presented to the iConference 2020 in Sweden—online due to COVID outbreak—this March. This summer she is scheduled to return to Pittsburgh to present findings and to continue work on a research paper on the topic for iConference 2021.  Her team’s research deals with the impact of abandonment in social media and was conducted through a survey of 152 Millenial women, ages 23 to 38. The team queried participants and collected responses on such topics as harassment, depression, anxiety, self-expression, and self-awareness, specifically on the Snapchat channel.  Lopez says her i3 participation has opened her mind to do more, saying, “you get what you put into it.” She has met and learned about diverse people and encourages others to drive themselves and ask the tough questions. “I’m very grateful to Davide Bolchini, chair of the Department of Human-Centered Computing, and to Senior Associate Executive Dean Palakal for their recommendation and support in making this opportunity possible,” Lopez said.  Lopez attended Providence Cristo Rey High School in Indianapolis where she took computing classes through the Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce (iDEW) Program, in particular the web design and Internet-of-Things modules. She enrolled at the School of Informatics and Computing in fall 2018 and says she “wouldn’t be the person she is today,” without these experiences, and that—despite her involvement technically ending next year—she will always be part of the i3 family.  Now a sophomore, Lopez is looking to pursue a career in statistics or sports analytics, hopefully within the baseball industry.   #### About the iSchool Inclusion Institute  The iSchool Inclusion Institute (i3) is an undergraduate research and leadership development program that prepares students from underrepresented populations for graduate study and careers in the information sciences. Only 25 students from across the country are selected each year to become i3 Scholars. Those students undertake a yearlong experience that includes two summer institutes hosted by the University of Pittsburgh School of Computing and Information and a research project spanning the year. i3 prepares students for the rigors of graduate study and serves as a pipeline for i3 Scholars into internationally recognized information schools—the iSchools. Most importantly, i3 empowers students to create change and make an impact on the people around them.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## School creates Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Working Group  August 7, 2020  Two years ago, the DEIWG embarked on a mission to create a more inclusive environment for SoIC students.  In fall 2018, the School of Informatics and Computing (SoIC) organized the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Working Group (DEIWG), led by Department of Library and Information Science chair, Andrea Copeland, at the request of Senior Executive Associate Dean Mathew Palakal.  The groups’ members—students, alumni, faculty, and staff—were self-nominated based on a sincere interest in working on issues related to diversity, equity, and inclusion.  The DEIWG defines its mission as “The DEI Working Group is committed to having an inclusive environment in the School of Informatics and Computing. We are dedicated to identifying situations where diversity, equity, and inclusion are not being met in order to create a more inclusive and accepting school. By having a venue for students, faculty, and staff to provide feedback, we can engage in dialogue for area of improvement. Membership is open to all in our community that want to cultivate a school environment where all feel truly welcome and encouraged to thrive.”  The group first focused on learning from campus experts and resources; examining data: climate survey, students surveys, as well as school data; and brainstorming ideas specific to the school community.  They met with Wayne Hilson Jr., then Senior Director of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, as well as Jessica Alexander, Instruction Designer from the Center for Teaching and Learning.  In late 2019, the DEIWG launched its website, held a UniversiTEA community building event, and received a budget of $10,000 from the dean, with which two students were hired to further develop the website. The site is intended to provide a centralized place to find and share information related to DEI in the School of Informatics and Computing and on the IUPUI campus.  Website features include:  ·      Make Your Voice Heard form allowing anyone in the SoIC community to anonymously share their experiences related to DEI.  ·      Forums encouraging discussion online of issues related to racism as well as other issues related to DEI, with moderation provided by working group members.  ·      Digital Exhibits helping students understand diverse expressions of culture that are timely. The group started with a St. Patrick’s Day Exhibit as many international students are often confused by the importance of this holiday to Americans. Currently, a Black Lives Matter exhibit is being created.  ·      News items from school and campus, and a resources portal with links to a comprehensive list of resources on our campus and a suggested reading list.   #### Continuing to change the landscape and move forward  Since its launch in 2015, the Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce (iDEW) program has expanded to eight Indianapolis area high schools, reaching more than 1680 students, including 492 who have graduated. Seventy-two percent of those are now attending college; 75 percent in STEM-related majors. The iDEW program, administered by SoIC and supported by multiple community businesses and organizations, provides underrepresented minorities the opportunity to experience project-based computing by design courses, IT training, and preparation for college and careers.  In 2018, the school began a campaign to create a scholarship to encourage diversity in the library and information science professions. The Wilma Gibbs Moore Graduate Endowed Scholarship is named in honor of IU graduate Wilma Moore, who worked as an archivist of African-American History at the Indiana History Center for much of her career. The first two recipients of the scholarship, Olivia MacIsaac and Lyndsey Blair, are currently studying for their MLIS degree at the School of Informatics and Computing.  Recruiting diverse faculty is another important part of addressing racial inequalities. “In the spring of 2020, we tried to start the Future Faculty Fellows program; however, the COVID crisis prevented any new hires,” said Copeland. “The goal of this program is to recruit future faculty as they are finishing their dissertation work and provide mentorship as they embark on their careers, with the hope that the fellows would join our faculty. When the budget improves, we intend to try this again.”  The school is also participating in the campus initiative, IChange, which is devising an action plan to encourage inclusive practices in STEM schools on the IUPUI campus. Other changes being encouraged are the addition of Diversity Champions to advisory boards, program and course learning outcomes that address diversity, equity, and inclusion, and a new school award created to acknowledge the work faculty, staff, and students who make notable contributions to building a more inclusive school environment.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## That’s smart coffee: Informatics students implement IoT design for Starbucks  August 19, 2019  Imagine your project group needs to learn everything they can about how to create a smart water filtration system for a leading coffee shop—you know, the one with a storefront on nearly every corner and in many grocery stores. You’d want to research water quality, then find out how to retrieve data from interconnected appliances, and then learn how to create a data dashboard for clients. Imagine having access to the expertise of Delta Faucet, GE Appliances, and Gauge Telematics, and you’d be living the experience of four of HCI Professor of Practice Lou Lenzi ‘s INFO-H 554 Independent Study in HCI students this past spring semester.  [Lou Lenzi](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/lou-lenzi/)  [Independent Study in HCI](https://luddy.iupui.edu/hcc/graduate/hci/masters/)  Jiahui “Miro” Wang, Parth Patel, Xiaochen Yu, and Yi-Shan “Tabitha” Tsai spent months in their warroom and on the road researching and designing an IoT (Internet of Things) system that would help Starbucks with preventative maintenance on their water equipment across their 8K+ stores across the United States. John Brockman and Cameron Gilbert, who work in R&D and Innovation at Starbucks HQ in Seattle, flew out to meet them twice over the course of the project—once in March for a mid-term review and again in May for final review.  Lenzi, formerly an industrial designer and executive at IBM, GE, and Thomson RCA, points to the value of student-client collaborations such as this one. “This project demonstrates how IoT is bringing together industry leaders and academia to solve real problems, while providing our students with world-class skills and training,” he says.  According to Brockman, Starbucks VP Engineering Venkat Venkatakrishnan, an old colleague of Lenzi’s from GE, was able to leverage this relationship to the mutual benefit of both organizations. Since Starbucks has prioritized IoT integration and is at the beginning stage, he says this project was well-timed to coincide with new equipment rolling out in the last six months.  I aspire to be a UX designer envisioning myself working on the design and usability of innovative technologies like Azure IoT solutions used by Starbucks. And the knowledge gained in the process of working with a mega real life client like SBUX is unparalleled!  —Parth Patel  The students, accompanied by Lenzi, met the Starbucks team at their Café in Crystal Lake, IL on January 31st. That location was chosen as it has one of only 4 IoT Water Filtration systems installed. They had the opportunity to interview their client and see a working prototype. (The Starbucks team bought the coffee during their meeting…) As an example of how dedicated these students are, they drove up from campus on a COLD Thursday morning—it was minus 9 degrees when they left IUPUI at 7 am—making the 4.5 hour trek up and back on the same day!  [column class=”first half”]  [/column]  [column class=”last half”]  [/column]  As part their research into understanding water quality, the CTO at Delta Faucet in Carmel arranged for the students to meet at their headquarters and spend time with one of their senior engineers. They learned a lot about water quality and water filtration—invaluable help from a local company. They also took a trip to GE Appliances in Louisville KY to learn about internet connected appliances and how GE Appliances could remotely pull data from these units and analyze the data. This was a great help as what they were doing had many similarities to this project.  Miro Wang says that, as the design lead in the Starbucks project, she enjoyed the challenge brought by the Starbucks project. Wang led the team to maximize the IoT capability for Starbucks water filtration system in both current and future stages and delivered a monitor system to fulfill current business needs. They also laid out detailed plans for their next iteration. “Starting with industry benchmarking, my team visited several well-established IoT companies and observed how product designers incorporate design philosophy into the development process for the Internet of Things,” Wang says. “Working side-by-side with stakeholders in Starbucks and my excellence teammates, I gained a lot of technically deep hands-on experience on how to communicate our design decision to ensure the quality of the deliverables for the project. With those valuable experience from the Starbucks project, I believe I can launch a successful product designer career in the IoT industry.”  Starbucks installed the prototype water filtration system  in the IoT Lab in Fishers so the students could pull data from the sensors installed on the unit. There are only five total such installations in the country—four are in Starbucks Cafes and one is in the IoT Lab. This install was a considerable expense for Starbucks, and they agreed to keep the install in place for future use.  The company is in the process of connecting store equipment to a “cloud,” so that the company as a whole is able to utilize data to understand the use cases of each piece of equipment; reduce store barista mindshare or opportunity cost for better customer engagement; allow for proactive repair and reduce reactive service; and improve forecasting to inform R&D the equipment pipeline.  “The overall objective was to produce a set of IOT dashboards that would monitor the water filtration system in Starbucks core retail stores,” Brockman explains. “The particular piece of equipment possessed an array of flow, pressure, and conductivity sensors. The student team was able to successfully produce a set of dashboards that were centered into four cross functional areas of focus: Store Barista, Facilities Contact Center (first point of contact for equipment issues), Corporate Facilities, and R&D.” The dashboards met the objectives of providing a quick overview and the ability to swiftly drill down to a specific store, specific equipment, and historical information, and Brockman says that Starbucks is currently incorporating the learnings from this project into their own UX dashboard design to expand beyond the water filtration system.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

Occasionally, for the learning objectives to be achieved through a project, it will be necessary for the external partners to provide confidential information. In those instances, they might request that students sign a Non-disclosure Agreement . It is also possible that they will expect students to transfer ownership of the intellectual property generated based on that information to them. That can be done using a Work Product Agreement . In rare cases, faculty might also be asked to sign a Non-disclosure Agreement .

In addition, if an external partner offers to provide funding to support the completion of the project, they cannot also require transfer of the ownership of the intellectual property generated through the project to them (exceptions can be made if approved by IU’s legal counsel). When funding is offered, the Development team should be informed so that the ALIGN and Development teams can determine how best to structure the payment.

    "body": "  ## Informatics and Computing faculty conducting research to develop breathalyzer-type device to detect low blood sugar for diabetes  September 24, 2015  A multidisciplinary team of researchers at IUPUI has been awarded a $738,000 National Science Foundation grant to develop a breathalyzer-type device to detect the onset of hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar episodes, in people with diabetes.  “Existing technology tracks current blood sugar levels, but it doesn’t alert the patient to an upcoming hypoglycemic episode,” said principal investigator Kody Varahramyan, senior aide to the chancellor and professor of electrical and computer engineering.  Hypoglycemia can be dangerous if it remains undetected. Children and the elderly with Type 1 diabetes are especially prone to sudden drops in blood sugar.  The three-year grant will fund research to:  “Researchers will identify the signature odorants, which are unknown to the medical community, using breath samples collected from patients,” said Mangilal Agarwal, a co-principal investigator. Agarwal directs the Integrated Nanosystems Development Institute and is associate director of research development in the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research.  The odorants will be verified with diabetes alert dogs that recognize the onset of hypoglycemia from those odorants. Patients would blow into the small device, whose sensor system would then communicate the patient’s hypoglycemic status, along with tracking information that provides a historical summary.  The research is expected to improve health-monitoring options for people with diabetes, decrease health care costs and improve lifestyles for diabetics.  The grant is part of an effort by the federal government to accelerate the development and use of innovative approaches that would support the transformation of health care from reactive and hospital-centered to preventive, proactive, evidence-based and person-centered, focused on well-being rather than disease.  The project will provide interdisciplinary research experiences to graduate and undergraduate students. In addition, this project will support participation of underrepresented groups and educational outreach programs for K-12 students and teachers across Indiana and the U.S.  “This research is particularly well-suited to an institution like IUPUI, with its focus on health and life sciences, and its ability to marshal experts from across disciplines, including engineering, science, medicine and informatics and computing,” Agarwal said.  Other investigators are Anthony Faiola, an associate professor of human-computer interaction in the School of Informatics and Computing; Peter Roach, director of the Center for Diabetes Research, School of Medicine; Sudhir Shrestha, an assistant research professor in the School of Engineering and Technology; Amanda Siegel, postdoctoral research associate in the School of Science; and Dana Hardin, a pediatric endocrinologist at Peyton Manning Children’s Hospital at St. Vincent.

    "body": "  ## $1M grant fuels discovery and analysis of proteoforms  May 31, 2016  Opening the door a better understanding of proteins—and our ability to treat and prevent diseases—the National Institutes of Health awarded $1.18 million to faculty at the Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing and the IU School of Medicine at IUPUI for a research collaboration that unites two cutting-edge technologies in the discovery and analysis of proteoforms.  Professor Xiaowen Liu from the Department of BioHealth Informatics at the School of Informatics and Computing and Professor Yunlong Liu from the Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics at the School of Medicine are principal investigators on the project, which combines their respective expertise in mass spectrometry-based top-down proteomics data analysis, and RNA (ribonucleic acid) sequencing.  The research team for the project, “Computational tools for top down mass spectrometry based proteoform identification and proteogenomics,” also includes Professor Harikrishna Nakshatri from the School of Medicine and Professor Si Wu from the University of Oklahoma.  In tandem, the technologies represent an enormous leap in discovering and analyzing proteins that can now be seen “top-down,” or intact, through mass spectrometry—a bird’s eye view that presents a new world in comprehending the number and classification of proteins, as well as a challenge in grasping their breadth and complexity.  The limitations of previous tools necessitated breaking the proteins into pieces, and the data models used to analyze them don’t translate to the comprehensive top-down view. Xiaowen Liu is one of the few researchers creating algorithms that accommodate the intricacy of the top-down mass spectrometry data.  His novel data model, the “mass graph,” will incorporate Yunlong Liu’s RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) modeling expertise to further aid in accurate identification at the proteome level. RNA sequences provide information that enables more precision in creating a data template for targeting proteins. The team will also develop a software pipeline that utilizes these technologies.  How many proteoforms might be discovered? There may be hundreds of thousands, says Yunlong Liu. “The proteins are more than just a sequence of amino acids. Some amino acids can be modified, and this technology will allow us to see those modification patterns as well.”  Getting a better picture of proteoforms will enhance our understanding of living organisms—and present the opportunity for advances in diagnosing patients. Comparing the protein forms for healthy samples and patient samples could reveal biomarkers that will improve medical prognoses, says Xiaowen Liu.  And there are very promising translational benefits for treatments, says Yunlong Liu. “We need to understand the form of the protein before we design a drug to target it. And so there is great therapeutic potential.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Sherry Corbitt-Warren Alumni Spotlight  December 10, 2018  Sherry Corbitt-Warren (Medical Records, ’85) is the co-founder and president of WLS Enterprises, Inc., an Indianapolis business that provides chemical dispensing and distribution services for pharmaceutical and biotech industries. She was kind enough to share her remembrances of the inception of her business, as well as her vision for the future of the rapidly growing field of life science.  After obtaining her degree in Medical Records Administration at the School of Informatics and Computing, Corbitt-Warren knew her future was in the medical industry but wasn’t quite sure in what capacity. “I knew I wanted to do something in the medical field,” she continued. “I came to the realization that I didn’t want to have direct patient contact, so I thought about occupational therapy, speech therapy, etc., but ultimately decided to go along the lines of indirect patient contact.” After working in the medical field for a number of years and earning a Master of Business Administration degree, Corbitt-Warren was ready for a new direction, and she was presented with a bold idea that would lead to the formation of WLS Enterprises, Inc.  “The vision for the business came from my husband, the visionary,” she remembers. Her husband, Andre Warren, is a former IU Bloomington student who had years of experience in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry. “He came up with the idea and I further developed the plan, secured a building, liability coverage, and got the financial backing.” WLS Enterprises was incorporated in 2000 and became fully operational in 2002. “We work primarily with pharmaceutical, biotech, personal care and animal health companies…What we do is repackage and distribute chemical APIs and high purity excipient raw materials for pharmaceutical manufacturing,” she said.  Corbitt-Warren has seen her business thrive since its inception. “The business has been in operation for 16 years and every year it has been profitable. In the early years we saw 50% growth every year.” As the business continues to grow, she is excited for what the future will bring for WLS Enterprises. “The field is wide open for new treatments and new medicine. As long as we perform well there will always be a demand for our services. I enjoy getting out and meeting new people and being on the cusp of new discoveries. We work hand-in-hand with big pharma companies and research scientists that are developing prescription drugs that will treat or slow the progress of major diseases,” she said.  Corbitt-Warren believes there is unlimited potential for students in the Health Information Management field, and that education will provide a strong foundation for future innovators. “The technology world is taking off, so I think current students will be best served by staying on top of current technological advances, because I find that the way things worked 16 years ago isn’t the way things work today. I would also advised students to take as many STEM courses as they can and master them because that coursework will be very pivotal to their success,” she said. This guidance is similar to what Corbitt-Warren experienced when she came to the School of Informatics and Computing, and she gives a great deal of credit to her early mentors. “My primary instructors were Mary McKenzie and Jan Ashton, and they were instrumental in getting me off to a good start. I am so thankful for those two outstanding women.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Grad Student Looks to Gaming for Clues to Enhance Education  October 4, 2013  For a big part of her life, IUPUI student Brittany Conway has loved games — all kinds of games — and costumes. In fact, she won first place in the costume contest at the 2010 Gen Con, an international event based in Indianapolis since 2003.  But for Conway — nicknamed “Brat” because two of her best friends share the same first name, and they all needed a way to differentiate themselves in conversation — games also can be serious business.  “I’m a gaming fan who hopes to change education by making it fit with games,” said the southside Indianapolis native, who believes children’s interest in games reveals ways to engage them in learning.  That’s a big reason that Conway, who has a Bachelor of Science degree in Media Arts from the School of Informatics and Computing, also pursued a psychology degree when she started college. She said she realized “social psychology is a really big part of gaming.” In May, she will pick up her master’s degree in Media Arts.  She has seen youthful passion for games of all sorts — computer games, role-playing games, desktop games, cosplay (shorthand for costume play) — lure significant numbers of high school students to the School of Informatics and Computing’s Game Camp, which she has helped run since 2010.  The popularity of 46-year-old Gen Con, which drew more than 49,000 participants this summer, also is an indicator of the rich possibilities for educators who want to link games with the quest for knowledge.  “People love the games, and love being around others who feel the same way,” Conway said.  Informatics has become a key player in that trend. The school has developed games for youngsters in elementary school, who use game-playing techniques to learn how to identify creatures. Informatics also launched a new game for Gen Con 2013 called “Return of Aetheria,” a collaboration between the school and the event.  Conway believes that gaming could help people who battle autism, like her younger brother, find paths to success. That’s one of the reasons she has felt an attraction to the STARS program — Students and Technology in Academia, Research and Service — a national organization aimed at women, under-represented minorities and people with disabilities.  For Conway and others who share her passion, Gen Con and games like “Return of Aetheria” help them explore other parts of life. “Aetheria,” for example, is a quest to restore magic to the world and uses technology, gaming skills, live theater space and actors for those who play. But the magic may be as much about finding it within themselves and their friends, as in the game.  Conway noticed it the year she won the costume award, when “I couldn’t go more than a few feet before someone wanted me to stop and get a picture,” she said. Wearing her costume, which includes a diver’s helmet, proved taxing, but it was important to others as much as it was to her.  “For most of us, Gen Con is more than an event,” she said. “It’s our summer vacation.”  For more information on the School of Informatics and Computing, visit http://soic.iupui.edu  For more information on the Media Arts and Science program, visit https://luddy.iupui.edu/undergraduate/mas/  For more information about the STARS group, visit                             http://stars.iupui.edu  Story courtesy of Ric Burrous, IU Communications   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## School of Informatics and Computing adds graduate certificate program in clinical informatics  March 23, 2010  Electronic health records, digital imaging and sophisticated diagnostic systems are revolutionizing how we provide patient-centered care. These increasingly pervasive technologies not only improve the quality, safety and efficiency of our health care system, but also change the skill sets required of qualified health care practitioners. A new online graduate certificate program in clinical informatics from IUPUI instructs local health care professionals on how to effectively apply and interpret emerging information technologies to their practice and career.  The clinical informatics graduate certificate program available at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI is the first of its kind in the state and one of few in the nation. The program developed from clinical informatics’ increasingly high profile on the national stage in the last several years. In 2004, former President Bush set into motion a plan to develop electronic health records (EHRs) for every American by 2014. That plan was reinforced in 2009 when President Obama signed the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA) into law, designating $19 billion in incentives to spur the adoption and use of health information technology.  Local health care industry leaders recognize the current and future value of its professionals – including doctors, nurses, nurse practitioners and pharmacists – gaining knowledge and practice in clinical informatics. “We know a lot about medicine. We also know how to acquire patient information,” said Dr. John Clark, MD, JD, Medical Director for Clarian Medical Quality and Patient Safety. “Our industry’s challenge is interpreting that information in meaningful and efficient ways. It requires experienced health care practitioners who understand data acquisition, storage and analysis.”  Alan Snell, MD, MMM, Chief Medical Informatics Officer of St. Vincent Health and Chairperson of the Physician Informatics Council through Ascension Health, echoes this sentiment. “We’re becoming more reliant on new information technologies and moving towards the elimination of paper records. In today’s environment, health care systems are embracing clinical informatics as a means to improve workflows, information exchange, and, ultimately, patient care.”  The graduate certificate program in clinical informatics consists of six courses available in the evening and accessible through online distance education. Applicants must have clinical backgrounds, be licensed and hold a four-year degree from an accredited institution. For more information, including admission requirements and how to apply, please visit https://luddy.iupui.edu/health/certificates/ or call (317) 278-4636.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

I am a sophomore at IU Indianapolis majoring in Informatics and Computing with a specialization in Network Security and Information Security.  I picked Luddy because I really enjoyed the iDEW program that I took when I was in high school. I learned a lot about technology and coding and that is when my interest grew for technology.  I chose to be a Luddy ambassador because I wanted to help others transition from high school to college or transferring college students. I was a student ambassador at my high school, and I wanted to continue helping others in my college years.   ### Zaydee Dominguez-Chang    Latino Outreach  Media Arts and Science / Informática y Artes Mediáticas en la Ciencia (Desarrollo de Pila Completa)  Hometown: Indianapolis, IN (Pike)  Career goal: Full stack developer  zadomin@iu.edu  Hello!

My interest in computer science and biology has led me to IU Indianapolis and this program.  As a first-generation Filipino American, navigating my first year of college was difficult. My parents studied overseas and were not aware of the different systems in american education, especially college education. It was a big adjustment for my family, since my siblings and I also grew up in the Philippines. Fortunately, there were people like student ambassadors and academic advisors who helped educate me about academic planning. As a student ambassador, I want the students and families I meet to be knowledgeable about the many different programs and opportunities available at IU Indianapolis and Luddy. I will prioritize and make sure that every student can start the school year confidently and excited for what is to come.  Throughout the year, I am finding more opportunities to be involved on campus. Last year, I was an Undergraduate Representative for the Informatics and Computing Student Council. Now, I am becoming more involved in the Biomedical Informatics Club, and learning about the different opportunities and skillsets they offer.   ### Saloni Dixon    Biomedical Informatics  Hometown: Fort Wayne, IN (Bishop Dwenger)  Career goal: PhD in Immunology (Immunoinformatics)  I am a fourth year at IU Indianapolis, pursuing a Bachelor’s of Science in Biomedical Informatics and a minor in creative writing. I will be applying for the Post-Baccalaureate Research Education Program (iPREP) this fall, and I hope to spend a year working with the Microbiology and Immunology Department.  With these degrees, I hope to use it towards developing cutting-edge research in all aspects of immunoinformatics. This interface between computational biology and experimental immunology is a passion I have been chasing since I was diagnosed as a kid. I battle with a disease called Mixed-Connective Tissue Disease. This is a combination of Lupus, Reynaud’s, and Rheumatoid Arthritis. Despite limited research in this field, it is my dearest hope to further expand biomedical understanding in both immunology research and clinical data, so new and preventable measures for autoimmune diseases like mine may be set in motion.  Prior to my experience at Eli Lilly & Company, I imagined a life of basic-level programming. However, I gained a piece of myself that I never realized was missing. Research wedged itself into my life, and I could not be happier. At a young age, I was told that a little person like me could never make a difference. I have come to understand that change is not simply born into existence, but it’s something fought for, dreamt for, and worked for until that gap no longer exists.  I will be a second year Social Justice Education Scholar (SJS) this year, as well as the Outreach Chair for the Midwest Association of Filipino Americans and a Luddy Indianapolis Student Ambassador. I strongly value community involvement in multicultural organizations, social justice programs, and mentorship.   ### Nimra Durrani    Biomedical Informatics  Hometown: Avon, IN (Avon)  Career goal: Biomedical Data Scientist  I am a sophomore at IU Indianapolis studying Biomedical Informatics with a specialization in Health Informatics. I have always had a strong passion for Biology. In high school, I was also involved in a program that taught young students different programming languages which then sparked my interest in programming. Coming into college, I was unsure of what career path I wanted to take until I did further research of the different programs IU Indianapolis offered. Once I came across Biomedical Informatics, I knew it was the one. Biomedical informatics allows me to pursue my interests in both biology and programming. Although many people have never heard of it, it excites me to educate others about what biomedical informatics is and further explain the different things I learn being in this program.  Aside from academics, I am currently a member of OTeam. OTeam is an undergraduate leadership group that focuses on engaging incoming students at IU Indianapolis. Branching off of that, I served the role as a leader during Bridge Week and this fall, I am a peer mentor for first year students in their first-year seminar sections.   ### Catherin Molina    Biomedical Informatics  Hometown: Lafayette, IN (Jefferson)  Career goal: General surgeon  Hi! I am a junior at Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering. I am majoring in Biomedical Informatics with a specialization in Premed. I always knew I wanted to study something with biomedical but I didn’t know what. Until I came across the Biomedical Informatics program. That is when I knew this was the one. I choose the specialization of premed because I always knew I wanted to get into medical school to become a general surgeon.  I was born and raised in Lafayette, Indiana. Both of my parents are from El Salvador. Being a first-generation student means so much to me. It showed myself and my family we can all become someone and have a better education. Hopefully being the first in my family to get into medical school to become a General Surgeon.   ### Ethan Plagge    Media Arts and Science  Hometown: Cincinnati, Ohio (Elder)  Career goal: 3D animator  My name is Ethan Plagge, and I am majoring in Media Arts and Science with a specialization in 3D Graphics and Animation. I’m originally from Cincinnati, Ohio, and am a sophomore at IU Indianapolis.  What originally drew me to IU Indianapolis was the wonderful and innovative media arts program we have and the number of amazing resources and facilities on campus. But what really separated IU Indianapolis from other colleges was the amazing community in the college of informatics. The relationship between the faculty and the students and the sense of unity among the students were what really made me choose to come to IU Indianapolis.  As a student, I’m currently involved as a tutor and am involved in my residence hall’s student government. I also plan on joining the IU Indianapolis Jagband, a pep band that attends IU Indianapolis athletic events. I am also involved with the first ever Luddy podcast, “Coffee and Computers,” which you can check out on Spotify or other major streaming platforms!   ### Jonathan (Jojo) Rendon-Lazo    Artificial Intelligence  Hometown: Indianapolis, Indiana (Ben Davis)  Career goal: Anywhere I have a passion.  I’m Jonathan, but everyone calls me Jojo. I’m a first-year majoring in Artificial Intelligence. As a kid, I’ve been in love with technology; having a Super Nintendo and the first iPod as a kid really made me grow. When I saw Iron Man, Jarvis really brought to my attention: how does a computer act so humanly? Then it was a big dream to create a Jarvis in real life.  In the IU Luddy summer tech workshop, I found the brand-new program IU Indianapolis was bringing, AI Informatics. I instantly fell in love with it because that’s what I’ve always wanted to do. I had a great time learning and having a better understanding of it through the workshop. After that, I toured the Luddy building. I’ve never felt more welcomed; they made me feel like family. Though IU Indianapolis is big, it is more like a family.  I want people to learn what Luddy Indianapolis has to offer. Not only with resources to help you be successful and the opportunities students have, but also to make you feel like family. That’s the main reason I became an ambassador. In my free time, I like listening to music, working out, going to church, and spending time with friends.   ### Alexys Shepherd    Media Arts and Science  Hometown: Indianapolis, Indiana (Franklin Central)  Career goal: Concept Artist/Scriptwriter  I am in my fourth and final year as a student here at Luddy Indianapolis. I am majoring in Media Arts and Science, specializing in Digital Storytelling with a heavy focus on concept art, and minoring in Creative Writing.  I have been creating art and drawing ever since I was little. What drew me to Luddy Indianapolis was how inclusive their programs were, providing a lot of opportunities and a major I felt comfortable with. Luddy Indianapolis gave me the chance to build myself up and improve so I can earn my way toward my goals of working somewhere within a video game company.  Outside of the ambassador program, I am involved in the Alpha Lambda Delta and Phi Eta Sigma honor societies.     ### Sahiti Somalraju    Biomedical Informatics  Hometown: Naperville, Illinois (Metea Valley)  Career goal: Bioinformatician  I am currently a junior studying Biomedical Informatics with a specialization in Bioinformatics. I have always enjoyed learning about genetics and computer science, but I was not sure how to blend these two passions into a career. Back in high school, I participated in the Genome Hackers summer camp, an event hosted by the University of Washington. This experience introduced me to the field of bioinformatics and highlighted the role of coding in driving genomic research. As a result, my academic journey guided me to Luddy Indianapolis, which offers a biomedical informatics program tailored for undergraduates.  Currently, I am an active member of the Biomedical Informatics Club, where I enjoy learning and growing (and having fun!) with my peers in this close-knit community. Furthermore, I am a research assistant in the Janga Research Lab, providing me with an invaluable opportunity to engage directly in the research process. I am also a member of the Alpha Lambda Delta and Phi Eta Sigma honor societies.   ### Kavin Thakkar    Informatics  Hometown: South Elgin, Illinois (St. Charles North)  Career goal: User experience professional  I am a senior studying Informatics with a specialization in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). I am also in the accelerated program for the Master’s in Human-Computer Interaction. Originally from the suburbs of Chicago, I chose IU Indianapolis for its great urban environment close to Indianapolis and chose what is now Luddy Indianapolis for its focus on user experience, which is my desired career area.  I am the President of the Circle K International (CKI) club here at IU Indianapolis, which is dedicated to service and volunteering. And I serve as the Chief of Staff for the Undergraduate Student Government, working to improve the lives of my fellow students with initiatives that effect positive change.  I am also in the Alpha Lambda Delta and Phi Eta Sigma honor societies and helped found the Coffee and Computers Podcast, a great student organization here at Luddy Indianapolis. As a lead front desk employee for student services and an undergraduate ambassador, I truly enjoy the community those roles bring and the potential we have to inspire and support others.   ### Austin Clement    Informatics  Hometown: Crown Point, IN  Career goal: Wear a suit  Hello!

I’m Denisse Henriquez Dubon. I’m currently a junior at the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering. I am majoring in Informatics and Media Arts and Science with a specialization in Web Design and Development.  During my freshman and sophomore years, I was able to be a peer mentor, where I got to engage with high school students that were involved with Upward Bound. This year, I will be doing an internship at Riley Hospital for Children.  I was originally a neuroscience student, but after doing some research and reaching out to people, I decided to switch my major. While talking to them, it made me realize that I enjoy creating new things!   ### John Gaynor    Full-Stack Development  Hometown: Mishawaka, IN  Career goal: Become an industry leader in the tech world by creating software that helps optimize people's lives.  Hello, I am a junior studying Full-Stack Development here at the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering. I came to this school with a passion for optimization and was curious to learn about how I could optimize things using computers.  I developed this passion through my background in competitive Rubik’s cube solving, in which someone had programmed an application to learn algorithms and track how long it took you to solve it. I had passed it off as too complicated—some students started learning programming in middle school; how could I start in college and keep up?  The combination of professors, classes, and other resources at Luddy gave me the confidence to pursue web development. Through studying and the opportunities found here at Luddy, I’ve come to love programming and am excited for a future in this field. As an ambassador, I strive to share those same opportunities with prospective students and inspire them to pursue their passions and turn them into meaningful careers.   ### Mohammed Hossain    Applied Data Science  Hometown: Fishers, IN  Career goal: Work as a Data Scientist  Hi!

I am Mohsin Siddiqui, studying Media Arts and Science with two specializations: Game Design and Development, and Digital Storytelling. It has been a dream of mine to be a Video Game Designer since I was in the 6 th grade, and I want to put some of the ideas I have in my mind out into the real world so everyone can enjoy them. One of my biggest dreams in the world is to inspire people like me to be who they are while also maintaining four concepts I don’t see much of in the modern world: ethics, morals, values, and virtues. I also have a knack for storytelling because I feel like if it doesn’t have a good story, it wouldn’t be good overall.  I always wanted to go to IUPUI, now IU Indianapolis, because most of my family are alumni or are currently going with me. My family is very important to me because they have taught me most, and I can’t help but be thankful to them. If you chose IU Indianapolis, you chose correctly because this place will feel like a secondary home.  I remember Bridge Week at IU Indianapolis, and the one thing I realized was how many people were like me or had the same interests as me. Down to video games, TV shows, comics, anime, and even WWE, which I don’t talk about with my friends at home because nobody watches them. My worry about fitting in went away as I made a lot of friends that I now consider family, and if things pan out properly, even business partners. I remember feeling the scariest feeling about whether I chose the wrong place. Then came the first week of class, where my professor Thomas Lewis invited a speaker to talk about his life, and a certain name popped up. Someone whose name I never thought I would ever hear in a college lecture. One of my favorite musical artists, Kid Cudi. I even had Cudi shoes on that day! I remember seeing that and realizing, “Mohsin, not only have you chosen the right college, but you’ve also chosen the right home as well.” I knew that by choosing IU Indianapolis, I not only made everyone supporting me happy, but I have also made my dreams come true.   ### Savanna Stewart    Media Arts and Science  Hometown: Indianapolis, IN  Career goal: Work on major motion pictures through the company Framestore in London.  In 2020, I graduated from Vincennes University with an Associate of Science Degree in Product Design and Production Processes. I learned skills in drafting, Creo, and 3D printing. I love learning, and I hope to expand techniques and skills for the future by merging both 3D printing and VFX. I am getting a dual degree majoring in Media Arts and Science and specializing in 3D Graphics and Animation. I am also majoring in Japanese Studies with a minor in Graphic Design.  I love to travel. I got my passport when I was nine years old and went to Europe in a group of six. I started learning Japanese in 2014. In my junior summer in high school, I spent two months in the Japanese IU Honors Program in the Foreign Languages Program. I was unable to speak English for eight weeks to improve my Japanese speaking ability and conversational comprehension. I grew very close with my host family, and I fell in love with Japan.  I have my own art business. I started by selling prints of my art at all three Jockamos' Pizza locations. I have since been commissioned for individual pieces and private murals. I am currently working on 3D-printed frames and bases for my artwork to go into my first exhibition. My artistic style tends toward using all colors in the rainbow to create colorful and vibrant work. I often get inspired by artists like Salvador Dalí, Jasmine Becket-Griffith, and Camilla d'Errico. Both for their use of color and exaggeration of the unexpected. I find taking new art classes and workshops sparks creativity and helps to stretch your brain into seeing things from a different perspective.   ### Sydney Wingfield    Media Arts and Science  Hometown: Indianapolis, IN  Career goal: Become a Creative Director  Hello!

    "body": "  ## New degree geared toward health, science and technology prepares students for careers of the future  April 16, 2015    The IU School of Informatics and Computing (SoIC) in Indianapolis in conjunction with the School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences (SHRS) will be offering a new accelerated degree option beginning in the fall of 2015 which allows students to complete complementary undergraduate and graduate degree programs in a shorter amount of time, giving them a head start on their career.  The two schools are jointly offering an integrated five-year bachelor’s to master’s (BS/MS) degree consisting of a bachelor of science in health sciences and a master of science in health informatics.  “The BS/MS program has several features that are attractive to students and employers, including greater breadth (BS) and depth (MS) of health sciences and informatics fundamentals and an application skill set in health informatics; better starting salary upon completion of the program; better career growth opportunities; and better preparedness to meet employment opportunities and challenges,” said Karl MacDorman, Associate Dean of Academic Affairs for the School of Informatics and Computing.  Those obtaining the BS/MS degree will graduate with advanced skills preparing them for the career paths of tomorrow. According to the Economics & Statistics Administration, science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) jobs have grown three times as fast in the past 10 years than other professions, and STEM workers are less likely to experience joblessness than non-STEM counterparts. STEM occupations are projected to grow 17% by 2018 compared to 9.8% for non-STEM occupations.  “We are excited about the new dual degree program of the BS in health sciences and the MS in health informatics.  It provides students the opportunity to simultaneously complete both their bachelor’s and master’s degrees in as little as five years.  It opens job opportunities in the field of health informatics, which is a discipline that is rapidly becoming critical to human health and disease prevention,” said Brent Arnold, Chair and Professor of the SHRS Department of Health Sciences.  Consistent with IUPUI’s vision and mission, the BS/MS degree provides students with intensive hands-on experiential and problem-solving learning. The primary benefits of this combined degree program are to broaden students’ career horizons by allowing them to receive two degrees in a shorter time frame and at lower costs than it would take to pursue the degrees separately.  Students interested in applying for the integrated degree will be able to do so in the sixth semester of their BS in health sciences program or when they have successfully completed their first five semesters (75 credit hours) with a cumulative undergraduate GPA of 3.25 or higher.  If you have questions about eligibility or the application process, contact Melinda McCormick, Academic Advisor mccormmc@iu.edu or Deanna Hart, Director of Student Enrollment Services delhart@iu.edu at the School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences or Elizabeth Bunge, Graduate Program Coordinator ebunge@iupui.edu at the School of Informatics and Computing.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

Used with permission . ]  Romisa Ghahari and Ryan Ahmed, respectively graduates of the Ph.D. and M.S. Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) program at IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, recently won a health innovation competition hosted by Parkview Health in Fort Wayne.  [Human-Computer Interaction](https://luddy.iupui.edu/hcc/graduate/hci/masters/)  Ghahari and Ahmed’s project, Mobile Text for Affordable Care, addressed challenges in healthcare delivery by advocating the development of a web-based provider directory that would allow underserved populations easier access to healthcare services in the region. Potential patients would be able to identify the availability, location, gender, and language of those who are willing to donate time providing care, either through use of technology or in person.  “To be inclusive, we propose two modalities for accessing information by patients in this population: simple push-pull SMS text messaging that works on both basic and smart phones, and interactive voice response (IVR)—a technology that allows a computer to interact with humans through the use of voice and a keypad,” they explained in their proposal.  Ghahari and Ahmed were introduced to leaders at Parkview Mirro Center for Research and Innovation through their advisor, Davide Bolchini , HCI associate professor and chair of the Department of Human-Centered Computing, while still students at the School of Informatics and Computing (SoIC). Parkview Health is a research partner in healthcare innovation projects with faculty in the school.  [Davide Bolchini](https://luddy.iupui.edu/hcc/graduate/hci/masters/)  “We are very proud of this important accomplishment and recognition of our HCI alumni,” said Bolchini, “which speaks volumes about their passion and innovative minds in leveraging existing technological platforms to design new and more accessible healthcare user experiences in our region.”  At Parkview, Ghahari worked as a full-time research scientist on the informatics research team, conducting focus groups, interviews, and usability evaluation sessions, and applying UX research methodologies to understand cardiac patients’ needs and design requirements to engage them in their health.  Ahmed works at Parkview as a User Experience Research Specialist and typically works with patients and health care providers, applying HCI methods in research studies and creating user-centered design of tools and technologies for improving care delivery or health outcomes. He said the HCI program taught him how to apply knowledge in real work situations through numerous practical projects and a highly relevant internship position. “I routinely use the knowledge earned at SoIC in my current role and often refer to materials used in my courses,” Ahmed said.  Parkview hosts the competition every year for its employees. The two worked together on the winning proposal and each had the similar advice for others. “Never be afraid to talk about your idea even it is the simplest idea and you might think other people have already thought about it,” Ghahari said. “Innovations do not always need to have a global impact. Simple ideas helping small communities can often be of great value,” Ahmed added.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

For Danita, the inspiration to provide financial support came early on in her experience with the school.  “When I was in the Health Information Administration Program, Mary McKenzie, the program director at the time, and Jan Ashton, a faculty member, both let us know the importance of supporting a HIA education and they established a culture of program support by its graduates,” says Danita. “When I became the interim program director, we were facing closure of the program under the School of Allied Health Sciences. I was so grateful to SoIC for accepting our program, and I wanted to show my appreciation for their support…. I saw the impact that philanthropy had on our students. We were able to offer several scholarships because of the contributions made by program graduates and corporate supporters.”  Danita was honored by many last year through the establishment of the Danita H. Forgey Scholarship in Health Information Management (HIM), which provides a renewable award to an HIM student. In the spirit of Danita’s record of service, volunteer service is a requirement of this scholarship. This follows Danita and her husband Robert Forgey’s establishment of the Ruth Walker Health Informatics Graduate Scholarship, dedicated to Danita’s former colleague and long-time friend.  Danita reflected, “Ruth Walker was very involved in the health information profession when I graduated from the Health Information Administration Program and was very visible throughout her career. She was also a great supporter of the HIM program; she recruited students, was a guest lecturer and was a professional practice instructor before she became a faculty member in SoIC.  When she was diagnosed with brain cancer a few years ago, I wanted to find a way to let her know how appreciated she is by me and others in the profession whose lives she has touched.”  Danita believes alumni giving is vital to enhance and expand programs. “I hope that our alumni will continue to support the HIM program and the SoIC.  The HIM program has grown tremendously since our move there and has been greatly supported by SoIC with faculty resources, student advising, office and classroom space, and technology, among many other things.  Graduates can also honor former faculty by contributing to the Gertrude Gunn, Mary McKenzie, Jan Ashton, Elton Ridley, Danita Forgey, or Ruth Walker scholarships.” Danita and Rob Forgey are members of the President’s Circle at Indiana University and we thank Danita and Rob for their continued dedication to and support of IU.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Capstone projects showcase School of Informatics and Computing students’ technology talents  July 1, 2021  (original story published May 4, 2021, written by Kirk Johannesen)  Graduating students in the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI recently demonstrated their skills, talent and acquired knowledge to a virtual crowd during the Spring 2021 Virtual Capstone Senior Showcase.  The popular, free event, which takes place at the close of each semester, was livestreamed for about six hours April 30 on Twitch, represented a culmination of knowledge and ability in an area of specialization for the 25 participating students.  Mathew Powers, the capstone event organizer and a lecturer in the Media Arts and Science program, said the capstone experience is the essence of experiential learning. The students take all they have learned and put it that into one project.  “The purpose is to show the world what they can do and hopefully have this be a crown jewel in their portfolio to acquire a job or give them the option to work for themselves,” Powers said. “These projects are not meant to teach them something new, but to take everything they have learned and truly put it into use.  “This is a chance for them to catch their breath, reflect and explore and create with their strengths. A lot is on the line, and they get a beautiful blend of what will be out in the real world with what we’ve tried to help them with in college.”  Just like the fall 2020 capstone, the spring showcase was conducted virtually because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Student capstone projects showcase their skills and talents in areas such as human-computer interaction, animation, 3D modeling and game design. Here’s a quick look at five student projects from the spring showcase:  Prism 7: Issue 1 Marcus Henline used Adobe Photoshop and Clip Studio Paint to create the first of eight issues planned for a comic series that follows Lucas Nichals, a young mutant trying his best in a cyberpunk fantasy.  Heroes of Gold Reach In Kaitlyn Van Atta’s immersive video game project, players can split from their party and aid the city to re-create what they possibly destroyed during their adventures. She used Unreal Engine 4, Blender and Clip Studio Paint to create it.  Idian and the Dreamsnatchers Sara Lansdell’s project involves concept art for a third-person adventure. It follows the protagonist, Idian, as he unravels the hidden truths about his species, the Nightmares, and the ones they fear, the Dreamsnatchers. The tools she used were Photoshop, Cintiq, Character Design, World Building and World Design.  Celfense Zachary Miller used Microsoft Word and Twine to create an interactive fiction narrative demonstration and a narrative design document for a hypothetical game.  Piece of Mind Dauson Poole’s project is a comic series about the journey of a young autistic robot and her first day of first grade. Poole used Clip Studio Paint to create the series.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

The title, along with the role, has evolved from the days when ordering books, checking them in and out, and teaching students the Dewey Decimal System was their main function.  The job of today’s teacher librarian is multifaceted, explains John Hochstetler, M.L.S., a Library and Information Science (LIS) alumnus and Indiana’s Hamilton Southeast District 2018 Teacher of the Year. “We still focus mainly on literacy, but literacy looks different today than when I first started. We offer reader’s advisory help to students looking for the right book, we promote literature through book talks and displays, and we curate a diverse collection that reflects our student population. However, we also focus much of our attention on digital literacy,” he says.  [Library and Information Science](https://luddy.iupui.edu/lis/)  Hochstetler believes this shift from the traditional model of school librarian has happened as a response to world demands, and that this trend will continue as more and more tools are developed. “With the influx of technology, students have the capacity to work collaboratively with others from around the world or to tap into the expertise of others, and we, as educators, should be providing that opportunity for them,” he says.  “The best part of my job is seeing the ‘lightbulb’ moments.”  Hochstetler says the main goal of teacher librarians is to empower others with new knowledge, whether through literature, online resources, or through experiences. When he co-plans units with teachers, he looks for resources that would enhance the students’ experience. “Sometimes it is connecting them with someone from our community or taking a virtual field trip with Google Expeditions or suggesting the best way to amplify their voices to share what knowledge they gained during the unit,” he says.  He spends a large part of his time staying up-to-date with the newest technology. Among the reasons is to keep current with real world so that his students experience that in school and to assist teachers in being more engaging and possibly more efficient. “If our students are more engaged in their own learning it makes the job of the teacher that much easier. The goal is always to empower students to ultimately help prepare themselves for their own future,” he says. However, he also cautions that while there is a need to stay current, “we need to remember technology is a tool and it doesn’t always lend itself to be the right tool for every situation.”  In the years since he completed his M.L.S. degree at the School of Informatics and Computing, including 11 at Sand Creek Elementary, Hochstetler has faced many challenges that didn’t exist at that time. One of the classes he refers back to is User Needs . He says the course was invaluable in determining the “why” of pursuing any particular project, i.e., if it doesn’t fit user needs then rethink the proposal.  He still reaches out to people he met through the M.L.S. program for support, and he highly recommends that teacher librarians develop a personal learning network to bounce ideas off. “I love the fact that this career allows me to continue to learn,” he says.  One thing that hasn’t changed? “The best part of my job is seeing the “lightbulb” moments,” Hochstetler says.   ### Acknowledgement  This article is part of an ongoing series about the evolving role of the modern library and information science professional, including archivists, digitization specialists, and data curators, among others. For example, today’s teacher librarian may be tasked with addressing what it means to be a good digital citizen, how to leverage technology to be a global collaborator, how to construct knowledge by exploring real-world problems, and deciding what would be the best tool to share that knowledge with others.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Health Informatics Faculty Member Named to IBJ’s “Forty Under 40”  February 14, 2014  Assistant Professor of Health Informatics at the School of Informatics and Computing, Dr. Brian Dixon, was recently named to “Indianapolis Business Journal’s”  “Forty Under 40 list.    “I’m still in awe about this whole thing,” Dixon said. “When I saw the others on the list, including Colts quarterback Andrew Luck and author John Green, it hit me how big a deal this is.”  One of the biggest reasons Dixon is pleased with the honor is the potential to change public perception of his chosen field. “The recognition helps people understand that we are professionals, and it brings clarity to what our field is all about,” he said. “It highlights the fact that our work focuses on improving people’s health care outcomes, and to make information flow more seamlessly through the health care system.”  Dixon believes that informatics is reshaping health care on both personal and professional levels. “The information systems that we design and implement helps doctors and health care professionals make more effective decisions from both a safety and quality-of-care perspective,” he noted. “But it also helps us to evaluate the types of decisions that professionals make, so we can see how decisions get made, which helps us re-engineer health care delivery processes and services.”  When he was an undergraduate at DePauw University, Dixon aspired to be a dentist. However, he found himself more intrigued with information technology, which put him on the radar screen for the Regenstrief Institute, a health services research organization based at IUPUI. It was the right place at the right time for Dixon, who noted “my work at Regenstrief excited me like nothing else, and turned me onto the possibilities that existed in changing health care for the better.”  “In my opinion, this is one of the top five places in the country because our campus has the infrastructure to support our initiatives, one of the top medical schools in the country to conduct clinical trials, and a business community that is interested in our field and willing to push the envelope,” Dixon said. “That makes this a place that has the ability not only to come up with really good ideas, but to test them and bring them to life in the real world.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## MAS students and alumni add fun element to international conference using AR skills  August 9, 2018  A group of students from Zebulun Wood’s N420 Multimedia Production Development class at the Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI has been busy collaborating with a team of developers and art directors around the globe, spanning several time zones. The project: Using augmented reality (AR) on mobile devices to promote the technology, contributors, and the host city of Vancouver, B.C., at the ACM SIGGRAPH 2018 conference.  SIGGRAPH, the Special Interest Group on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques, is an interdisciplinary community interested in research, technology, and applications in computer graphics and interactive techniques. The annual conference is an opportunity to experience and discuss the latest developments in gaming and interactive apps, art and design, production and animation, research and education, and new technologies.  Recent alumni Patrick Bellido-Choy, Jordan Nelsen, Amanda Papandreao, and Bryan Keefe, and current students Jacob Dehart and Caiti Morris, under the guidance of overall project managers Wood and Casey Kwock, are part of the team that has been creating sigglets—their icons, textures, and animations—for the ScavengeAR App that will offer fun, engaging experiences for conference attendees.  “Working in a team remotely, across time zones and in real time, is the closest simulation of real-world mobile app and game production pipelines our students could experience here at IUPUI,” said Wood, lecturer and co-director of the Media Arts and Science (MAS) undergraduate program.  Kwock, who coordinated the project volunteers from his base in Southern California, said, “We started the project as a creative way to give students and volunteers an opportunity to work together and contribute to SIGGRAPH. It was great to see the students from IUPUI share their ideas and step up to provide support to each other when needed.”     ### This is not your father’s scavenger hunt  Sigglets are animated, virtual creatures that can be located and captured with the help of a smart device. Each one is associated with fun facts and useful information about the conference.  This year’s conference participants will use the app on their devices to look for nearly 40 sigglets, using unique markers to help capture the creatures, learn about the speakers, events, and contributors, and earn  prizes. The more sigglets attendees find, the bigger the prizes they can win at the conference. The purpose of this high-tech scavenger hunt is to encourage attendees to venture out into Vancouver, attend after hours mixers, and network with fellow conference attendees.  Bellido-Choy is the project manager and 3-D generalist; Nelsen, Papandreao and Morris specialize in 2-D art and texturing; and Dehart and Keefe work on 3-D modeling and texturing. This is the second year that students at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI have been asked to contribute to the design and development of the app.  “It’s so cool to get the opportunity to work on something and see it actually come to fruition and become an actual real thing that people are interested in. That, and getting so much creative liberty when we were working on the character designs, were really my favorite parts of working on the app,” said Papandreao.  Bellido-Choy found the work to be both enjoyable and challenging. “Getting to work with people from all over the world was a really enlightening and rewarding experience. I learned a lot about communication and the pitfalls and highs that come with it,” he said.  Wood explained that the efforts of many of the students on the team went far beyond the 16-week spring semester and he extended a special thanks to Bellido-Choy, Papandreao, and Nelsen for putting in extra hours during the summer to make sure the app and sigglets were at their best. Wood added, “I’d like to thank all of the professional volunteers that enthusiastically worked with our students and also the SIGGRAPH 2018 leadership, including IUPUI alumnus Joshua Grow, Chair of the Attendee Experience Committee, and Denise Quesnel, who endorsed us in year one, for their continued support and educational outreach. Go SIGGRAPH!”  Twenty media arts and science students will also be student volunteers or team leaders at the conference, where they can make valuable industry contacts.     ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## LIS-S 686 Web Archiving and Preservation  3 credits  [schedule](https://sisjee.iu.edu/sisigps-prd/web/igps/course/search/)   ### Description  To comprehensively represent records created in the 21st century, select websites and other web-based resources should be captured, stored, managed, described, and made accessible as appropriate. Content available primarily or solely online is among the most at-risk of born-digital materials. Materials on the web tend to be ephemeral and subject to loss for reasons including: intentional removal, technical errors, evolution of software and website redesigns, which can result in broken links and/or significant alteration of the look and feel of the site. Web archiving is an evolving practice that presents many opportunities and challenges. In this course we’ll cover core web archiving concepts and discuss how they apply in libraries, archives and museums. We will start with fundamental concepts in web archiving, including: defining terms, exploring ethical considerations, and understanding main components of web archiving workflows. How one can plan (scope) a web collection, form it and share what’s collected will be covered. Students will learn about collecting models for web resources and the context in which this work is being done, including lesson learned via case studies. The course will feature hands-on work with the leading suite of web archiving tools (Archive-It) and explore other approaches to smaller scale collecting.   ### Program Learning Goals Supported  Instructors map their courses to specific LIS Program Goals . Mapped program goals drive the design of each course and what students can expect to generally learn.  [LIS Program Goals](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/masters/mlis/program-goals.html)   ### Learning Outcomes  Instructors develop learning outcomes for their courses. Students can expect to be able to achieve the learning outcomes for a given course after successfully completing the course.   ### Course Overview  Instruction is in Canvas. Lessons are organized into Modules whose length may vary.

    "body": "  ## MLIS student Whitney Thompson awarded for music history research into “Claribel”  May 15, 2023  Soon to be Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS) alumna Whitney Thompson recently received the 2023 HS History Research and Innovation Award and the Walter Gerboth Award for her work investigating the life and career of Charlotte Alington Barnard, aka “Claribel”, a popular and successful songwriter in 1860’s England.  Both of the research awards she received are from professional organizations in the library field, the Reference and User Services Association (part of the American Library Association) and the Music Library Association. “It’s been hard for me to find funding opportunities,” Thompson said, “because I’m not a Ph.D. student and my research into Claribel isn’t for thesis or dissertation. I’m grateful that the eligibility requirements for these awards are flexible enough to accommodate researchers like me.”  The MLIS degree with a digital curation specialization at Luddy Indianapolis encompassed almost every aspect of information science that Thompson was interested in, with room for a few electives to spare. “No other library science program I’d been looking at fit my interests and budget nearly as well as Luddy’s. Anywhere else, I wouldn’t have had enough space for my own interests among all the other required classes,” she said.  Thompson said the online, asynchronous nature of this degree was also a huge benefit. She shared that it is pretty common for library degrees, wherein it’s basically assumed that students will be working during their time in school—gaining practical experience alongside their coursework, as well as just making a living. That was the case for her, too; She had a good full-time job in Madison, Wisconsin, and the work she was doing was directly relevant to the types of jobs she wanted to shoot for post-MLIS. With IUPUI’s program, she was able to balance work and school during her degree.  The digital curation specialization is quite technical in nature, but she found ways to be creative with her coursework. “I love tinkering around with multimedia and experimenting with different forms of and tools for storytelling,”  Thompson said. Her first graduate degree was actually an MA in communication and new media from McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, where she “took every opportunity to create multimedia projects for my classes and teach myself new things in the bargain, which is something I continued here at IUPUI.”  A highlight from among the projects she has done at Luddy was the interactive Twine game she created for S581 Archives and Records Management. One of the assignments for that class asked students to create a stand-alone instruction session on how archives work. Thompson said she loves to make things more complicated for herself, so she emailed the instructor Denise Rayman and asked if she could make a Twine game to simulate the process of archival research. “This is one of many reasons why I cannot speak highly enough of Denise. She pretty much said “that sounds great, knock yourself out!” And I almost did, literally, because finishing that project on time involved more late nights than I could count. The end result was absolutely worth it, though,” Thompson said.  Thompson taught herself to use Twine in order to create an archival-research game for the Archives and Records Management course. She also created two digital-exhibit websites via the Omeka platform, one for her Digital Collections course and one for her Information Sources and Services course. The latter site was her submission for the “annotated bibliography” assignment, which many Luddy MLIS students complete as part of their degree program—and, of course, her subject of choice was Claribel.  I’m a better historian because I’m a librarian.  “Library school has also been an enormous influence. I’m a better historian because I’m a librarian,” Thompson said. She knows where she can search for relevant material (primary source databases, WorldCat, HathiTrust, &c) and how to search for it (Boolean operators, wildcard characters, filtering). She can interpret archival finding aids and figure out whether a collection has materials she wants to see, and also knows full well that archives can have silences and gaps. She has worked with OCR software enough to have a good sense of where and how it misinterprets text—and, as such, how she can work around that when doing full-text searches of primary sources.  Thompson named Dr. Angela Murillo as one definite influencer at Luddy. She had been one of Murillo’s assistants on a couple projects so far, and had learned so much about scholarly communication in a couple different senses. The first project she worked on involved comparing several web-based digital repositories in terms of their user experience and viability for various types of scholarly outputs, and Thompson said she can already tell she’s going to lean on that experience heavily when applying for scholarly-communication jobs. She has also been learning how to write social-science papers and said the styles and conventions are different enough from humanities writing that she’s had a decent learning curve, but she loves the challenge and the opportunity to broaden her own disciplinary horizons.   ### What’s next?  Right after she graduates, Thompson is headed to England. Funded by the two awards she received, she will travel around the country for six and a half weeks, neck deep in various archives and photographing “every currently-undigitized scrap of archival material she can get her hands on.” She will spend a lot of time at the British Library, the National Archives, the Lincolnshire Archives, and the Louth Museum. Thompson is also giving a talk at Nerd Nite London on May 17, and is on the program for two academic conferences while there: Women, Money and Markets 1600-1950 and Music in Nineteenth-Century Britain.  One of the classes Thompson took her final semester was S511 Database Design with Dr. Kyle Jones, for which she built a relational database from scratch. She had wanted to build a relational database for recording Claribel-related information for a while, because she figured it would be the best way to represent all the interconnected data about her songs,  “It’ll be a lot of data entry, but I should be able to marshal that data in cool ways and quantify some of the observations I’ve made about Claribel’s career,” she said.  Thompson’s ultimate objective is to write a biography of Claribel. “After this trip, I’ll hopefully have assembled enough information that I can confidently piece together the trajectory of Claribel’s life and career—find the narrative, essentially,” she said. Her goal is to have the book outlined by the end of 2023, so that in 2024 she can put together a full book proposal and start querying literary agents.  Thompson is still very much job-hunting. While she’s keeping an open mind, her absolute ideal situation would be an academic library gig somewhere in the Midwest (e.g. Chicago, Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Detroit/Ann Arbor), working in the general Venn diagram of scholarly communication, digital curation and digital repositories, research data management, and metadata. She is especially keen to find a position where she can use her existing copyright knowledge in a library or archival context.  Her main advice for prospective MLIS students is to pace themselves. “You don’t have to plunge straight through this program, either—you can take classes at exactly the pace you need, based on your own existing obligations and abilities. And even if you do occasionally bite off more than you can chew, or if various work, medical, or family emergencies come up such that you can’t complete an assignment quite on time, 98% of the time your instructors will understand,” she said.  “Life is unpredictable. Weird stuff happens sometimes. The people in this program get that, and it’s one of the things I’ve found most valuable about this degree. It’s helped me be kinder to myself when I have a lot on my plate.”   ### What is the story behind Claribel?  For over four years, Thompson worked for a digital sheet music company—Musicnotes, based in Madison, Wisconsin. Her job and the company changed and grew a lot over her time there, but her two most consistent responsibilities were cataloging new products in their database, and researching composer and copyright credits. When Thompson was cataloging some new piece of sheet music or researching song credits, she would do her absolute best to ensure accurate metadata.  Accuracy helps artists get music royalties. Music metadata remains largely un-standardized, but artists can’t get paid for usage of their songs if they’re not linked to those songs through accurate metadata. As of mid-2022, Musicnotes had paid over $120 million in royalties since the company’s beginnings in 1998. “I’m enormously proud of the work I did there, because I was helping to put well-earned and well-deserved money in artists’ pockets, and in general helping artists get recognized for their work,” Thompson said.  One day in April 2021, Thompson came across a piece of sheet music on the Musicnotes website that had incorrect metadata. The song was titled “Give of Your Best to the Master,” and while the sheet music itself credited a “Mrs. Charles Barnard”—which would have been annoying enough—the website metadata listed the song as “composed by Charles Barnard.” (Women being credited only by their married names and or as “Mrs. (husband’s name)” is a pretty well-known issue in historical research.)  The lyrics to this particular hymn were composed in the early 1900s by Howard B. Grose, a former president of the University of South Dakota, and set to an existing tune—one composed a few decades earlier, by Charlotte Alington Barnard. That information alone was enough to correct the music metadata… but Barnard’s Wikipedia page and the sources it cited revealed more to the story. Charlotte Alington Barnard was better known by the pseudonym “Claribel,” and under that name she published over 100 songs from 1859 until her death in 1869 (mostly popular ballads rather than sacred music, too). Furthermore, she was “the most commercially successful composer” for her publisher, Boosey & Sons (according to Grove Music Online)—and she was also one of the first composers ever to receive royalties for her music sales. For sheet music specifically, too, because this was the era right before the advent of recorded sound.  Royalties were a paradigm shift in the music business. Before the advent of royalties, composers who wanted their songs published usually had to sell the copyright to a publisher, relinquishing all rights to their work. They could maybe get a decent lump-sum payment for it if they were well-known and/or had a good sales track record, but more often they’d just get a pittance, or a few free printed copies of their sheet music. Every song was a gamble for publishers, because they ultimately couldn’t know what would sell—but composers still got a raw deal if their song did turn out to be popular. The publisher owned the copyright, and they could print and sell as many copies as they pleased, raking in all the profits. The composer wouldn’t see a cent.  As it happens, John Boosey of Boosey & Sons—Claribel’s primary publisher—seems to have been the first music publisher in England to extend royalties to composers, and Claribel was the first composer on his roster with whom he made a royalty arrangement. So when Thompson was reading about this for the first time, it was a giant shift in perspective for her. “The modern system of music royalties that I worked with while at Musicnotes, the whole idea that there’s value in people’s enjoyment of music and that musicians deserve compensation for that labor… all of that had to start somewhere, and it seemed like it started in part with this woman who called herself Claribel,” Thompson said.  There isn’t much out there on Claribel, at least not in scholarly literature. Thompson has found her in a handful of scholarly articles, small entries in a few biographical dictionaries, one delightful book called She Wrote the Songs by Patricia Hammond, and one prior attempt at a biography that was published in 1965 and is out of print. The vast majority of what Thompson has discovered about Claribel herself has been through primary source research, and the majority of that has come from IUPUI’s database subscriptions. In particular, she has amassed a sizable collection of scanned pages from 19th-century periodicals and she has used these primary sources to several ends thus far. She has been compiling a definitive list of Claribel’s published songs (a previous list was incomplete) and she has also analyzed how music critics discussed—and dismissed—Claribel’s work.  About half the existing scholarship on Claribel has ignored her reception in the media of her day, but since Thompson’s academic background is in media and cultural studies, that was one of the first things she started investigating. “When I was completing my MA degree, I also worked as a research assistant to Dr. Christina Baade, who was and is researching the postwar career of the British singer Vera Lynn. A lot of the work I did for that project involved periodicals research, looking at all the Vera Lynn coverage in mid-20th-century entertainment industry magazines and seeing how Lynn constructed her own public image—and how, occasionally, these periodicals would construct it for her. That’s had a huge influence on my approach to researching Claribel,” Thompson said.  Read more about Claribel     ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Faiola develops new medical information visualization technology to reduce errors in ICUs  April 5, 2010  Intensive Care Units (ICUs) are home to many healthcare facilities’ most critical and vulnerable patients. They are also home to multiple forms of technology and equipment, each offering staggering amounts of patient data. Recognizing that quality care is dependent upon the ability to monitor, interpret and respond to patient data quickly and accurately, a team of researchers is changing how doctors and nurses interface with health information in ICUs.  They have created the Medical Information Visualization Assistant (MIVA), a new technology that consolidates large amounts of essential patient information into one visual and interactive format. It aids physicians and nurses by allowing them to streamline work processes and ensure accuracy of information. Devices monitoring patients’ vitals, such as blood pressure, heart rate and other measures, are integrated with MIVA and displayed on a large touch-screen within the ICU. MIVA can also track changes over time. This means physicians can interpret the longitudinal effects of an intervention on patients’ health, such as a newly administered drug.  Initial testing of the device has been positive. In a 2006 usability study at the Indiana University School of Medicine and Riley Hospital for Children, physicians using MIVA were found to be faster and more accurate than those in a control group. In this same study, a majority of physicians that interacted with MIVA agreed that the device has the potential to improve critical care decision-making. A provisional patent application has been filed. The research team is continuing to test the device and plan to demonstrate MIVA to potential venture capitalists.  The team is led by Dr. Anthony Faiola, Executive Associate Dean and Director of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) at the Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI. He has partnered with Dr. Simon Hillier, Professor at the Dartmouth College School of Medicine. Atif Zafar, Professor at the Indiana University School of Medicine and the Regenstrief Institute, Robert Comer, Director of the Informatics Research Institute, and Christine Newlon, a Ph.D. student in HCI at IUPUI, are providing development support. The project is supported by a two-phase grant from the IUPUI Solution Center and matching funds from the Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Human-Computer Interaction Ph.D. student interns at Microsoft Research Cambridge to design novel experiences for nearby devices  November 17, 2015  A Ph.D. student in the Human-Computer Interaction program at the School of Informatics and Computing spent her summer as a research intern at Microsoft Research’s Human Experience and Design Laboratory at Cambridge in the UK. Working with MSR researchers, Debaleena Chattopadhyay (pictured third from the left) designed an application to facilitate audience interactivity with presentations using an ad-hoc aggregation of co-proximate devices (such as laptops or smartphones).    Debaleena worked with her MSR mentor Kenton O’Hara on the Social Devices project that looks into ways to designing experiences for nearby device ecosystems. “To increase audience engagement in presentations, I designed a PowerPoint plugin and a companion smartphone app that enabled audience members’ qualified, interactive access to slides from their mobile devices. This application shifts the static one-to- many paradigms of slideware to an inclusive experience—and is expected to foster more audience engagement,” Debaleena explained. In a research study conducted at MSR, she observed many emergent behaviors of the designed application, such as easy hand-over to co-presenters and increased spatial mobility within the social roles of presenter and attendees. “The crux of this research project was to design a user experience spanning multiple proximate devices that significantly increases the devices’ cumulative value—but without increasing the cumulative complexity of the interaction experience,” Debaleena said. An article reporting the preliminary findings of her project is currently under review for publication.  Debaleena is excited to continue her internship project at IUPUI with her advisor, Davide Bolchini, Associate Professor of Human-Computer Interaction in the Human-Centered Computing Department at SoIC, in collaboration with MSR researchers. “We plan to study the use of this novel interactive application in the broad variety of unique presentation settings available in academia (and not necessarily available in industry contexts). Given the diversity of student population that IUPUI attracts due to its urban setting and a wide range of curriculum, we have an unparalleled opportunity to investigate the future of collaborative slideware and the opportunities for such next-generation tools to increase student engagement. ”  Before joining the Human-Computer Interaction Ph.D. program at the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, Debaleena received a Master’s degree in Computer Science from the State University of New York at Stony Brook. In SoIC, she works on designing touchless interactions for wall-sized displays. Her research interest lies in studying novel interaction experiences and input technologies.  Debaleena has previously served as the chair of the ACM-W chapter at IUPUI and the graduate vice-president of Women in Technology student organization. Some of her awards include the 2012 IUPUI Fellowship, the 2015 IUPUI Premiere 10 Award, and the 2015 Best Graduate Student in SoIC Award. She has published her peer-reviewed work in Interacting with Computers, Cognition, and the Conference on Advanced Visual Interfaces; and invited to present her dissertation research at multiple venues.  “I was able to pick up the right set of skills to pursue Human-Computer Interaction research at IUPUI,” explained Debaleena. “The HCI Ph.D. program at SoIC focusses on fundamental methods to conceptualize innovative ideas and to define user requirements that make designs a right fit into the fabric of our everyday life. This crucial understanding of the multifaceted, human-centered factors that are essential to building the next-generation of interactive experiences played a key role in successfully completing my internship at Microsoft Research.”  “Suddenly, ‘the best way to have a good idea is to have a lot of ideas’ was no more a classroom cliché. Quick iterations, repeated critiques, and learning to avoid common pitfalls were crucial in making steady progress,” Debaleena said. Collaboration with researchers also played an important role. Although she was working at MSR Cambridge, she often collaborated with researchers from other MSR offices, such as China and Redmond.  “I also got to learn new research skills from my MSR mentor that will help me immensely as I continue to pursue a career in research,” Debaleena said.  Overall, the internship was a great learning experience—albeit challenging but profoundly rewarding. “I think my experience in working on diverse research projects—an opportunity that I got in SoIC—helped me the most. But to be a researcher, one has to be willing to learn new skills right up one’s sleeve.” Well, Debaleena learned to develop Microsoft Office tools and Windows mobile applications during her internship to prototype her project.  She was especially impressed by the freedom she had in shaping her project at MSR—in spite of being an intern. “I was given the choice to pitch ideas related to the lab’s research agenda and steer one of them through the design, prototyping, and evaluation phase.”  Although it was often unnerving to sit at the same table with the expert researchers that Debaleena had only known through their keynotes, journal articles, and news stories, and revered, she described the lab as a very tight-knit community. “Researchers—either in my field or not—were unbelievably approachable; and if I needed any help, all I had to do was to write an email or drop by their office.”  During her internship, Debaleena also had the opportunity to meet other interns, who share her passion for computing. “When you work with a group of talented and passionate researchers— who will always go the extra mile, your drive is only amplified,” she said. “We took equal joy in punting down the Cam on a Saturday afternoon as in getting the right design on a Monday project review meeting.”  When asked why she chose to pursue a Ph.D. in HCI, Debaleena said: “As computing sweeps into every aspect of our lives—from home to work to travel and beyond—designing appropriate user-friendly technologies has emerged to be the next frontier of computing. Skills in applying HCI principles toward developing future technologies is thus at a demand higher than ever before. I believe that a Ph.D. training in HCI can prepare me to envision new interactive technologies that are human-centered and thus to ‘invent the future’ of computing products.”   ### About Microsoft Research  Founded in 1991, Microsoft Research is dedicated to conducting both basic and applied research in computer science and software engineering.

They got a taste of a real-world project, and how much that goes into it. They spent many hours, as did faculty, getting it ready, everything from character development and strategy to artwork, and integrating the technology. A lot of hard work and it was over in just a few short days,” said Mathew Powers, professor of the N485 class.  The second in the series Return of Aetheria: War of Realms was introduced at PoPCon last year, and ended with the Earth Realm in chaos and deceit. In the finale, ‘Rise of Nether’, it is up to the player to master an element, help destroy Espir and Nether, and take back the realms!  The game, played on many platforms, included alternate reality this year and involved mini-games and quests that took you from the main Return of Aetheria booth, outside to sites all around the convention. There were over 300 registered to play this year, up from last year. Prizes were given out many times during the course of the game and there was a create-your-own-bundle prize for the four highest scoring players.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## New $100K JPMC grant to support iDEW Youth Internship Program in Indianapolis  April 9, 2019  JPMorgan Chase has announced a $100,000 grant to fund the launch of IUPUI’s Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce Youth Internship Program, a workforce initiative that offers educational and career support to underserved high school students to help prepare them for the information technology jobs of the future.  Administered by the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, iDEW is a wraparound educational and career pathway model for information technology that helps provide real-world experience for high school students and connects them to local technical jobs and internships. The JPMorgan Chase grant is creating opportunities for up to 75 additional students for employment at Indianapolis-area companies in 2019.  Unemployment among 16-to-24-year-olds remains nearly three times the rate for adults 25 and older. Access to quality summer work experience helps put teens and young adults on a path to greater economy mobility. As part of JPMorgan Chase’s workforce efforts around the globe, the firm has invested $17 million in summer youth employment programs in 22 U.S. cities that have resulted in 40,000 youth being placed in summer jobs across 7,000 work sites around the country, including in Indianapolis.  “Summer employment in technology industries helps young people prepare for the demands of a changing economy,” said Owen Washburn, vice president for global philanthropy at JPMorgan Chase. “We are pleased to support iDEW’s internship program because it offers that opportunity for students in Indianapolis’ fast-growing tech economy.”  The iDEW summer internship program is a part of EmployIndy’s Project Indy, whose vision is to drive growth in Marion County by investing in innovative strategies focused on reducing barriers that residents might encounter that would block their access to career pathways. EmployIndy will help coordinate these efforts.  “EmployIndy is pleased to leverage its position and programs, including Project Indy and Job Ready Indy, to help iDEW connect talented students to work-based learning experiences with local employers,” said Angela Carr Klitzsch, president and CEO of EmployIndy. “Internships like these equip students with the skills and experiences needed to impact the local workforce in the in-demand technology field.”  Real-world experience for high school students is one of many ways the iDEW program aims to prepare students for work readiness in IT careers. According to iDEW Program Manager Vicki Daugherty, iDEW students are uniquely qualified to fill internships in technical roles rather than perform the routine clerical tasks often assigned to high school students “due to their experience in creating technology solutions to authentic challenges that reflect tech industry practices and principles, including agile development and user-centered design. Through project-based learning, iDEW students are accustomed to working collaboratively, putting to use creative, critical, computational and design thinking skills.”  Currently, 44 percent of the iDEW respondents in a recent survey are working, including in IT positions at Bank of America, Infodynamics, Defenders and the Wells Center; 10 more iDEW students interned this summer at Cummins and Eli Lilly.  “We found all the students who were part of the Cummins IT projects to be confident and to have the right level of foundational IT skills,” said Chaitanya Rao, software lead engineer at Cummins. “They also demonstrated a very good attitude toward learning new technologies and were productive in a very quick time.  “Having iDEW students as part of our teams has been truly a win-win situation for both the students and Cummins, and we look forward to continuing this engagement in the coming years.”  More than 160 other iDEW students are actively looking for internships and can benefit from brokering services offered by ProjectIndy.  JPMorgan Chase first partnered with the School of Informatics and Computing in 2015 to pilot the iDEW initiative. The program has recently completed its fourth year and has served over 1,000 students in eight Indianapolis-area high schools to date. The program boasts a 94 percent college attendance rate, with 68 percent in STEM-related degree programs. This latest grant brings JPMorgan Chase’s total sponsorship of iDEW to $450,000.   ### About iDEW  Students can participate in iDEW for multiple years during high school, diving into new projects and learning modules as they advance through the program. Many will earn professional IT certifications that prepare them for the workforce or for going on to two-year or four-year academic paths in informatics. Working in teams, iDEW students present informatics projects that tackle real-world problems incorporating mobile apps, robotics, video games, internet of things, chatbots, data visualization and other trends in IT. Learn more online or contact Vicki Daugherty, iDEW program manager, at vdaugher@iupui.edu.   ### About EmployIndy  EmployIndy guides the local workforce ecosystem and makes strategic investments to remove barriers to quality employment for underserved and underrepresented residents. As the workforce development board for Marion County, guided by 21 business, civic, education and nonprofit community leaders, EmployIndy invests $20 million annually in public, private and philanthropic funds for both youth and adults.   ### About JPMorgan Chase  JPMorgan Chase and Co. is a leading global financial services firm with assets of $2.7 trillion and operations worldwide. The firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing, and asset management. A component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, JPMorgan Chase and Co. serves millions of customers in the United States and many of the world’s most prominent corporate, institutional and government clients under its J.P.

    "body": "  ## MAS alumnus brings broad skill set to young patients at Riley Hospital for Children  June 28, 2023  When Jacob Lovrinic was growing up, he spent most of his free time inventing and creating—from massive train layouts to motorized grocery carts and a robot that could paint—and started his own 3D printing business. Along the way, he dabbled in MineCraft and other video-based games and making YouTube videos. At school, Lovrinic joined FIRST Robotics at Center Grove schools, culminating in a stint as Operations Captain his senior year. One of the team’s outreach efforts was their summer Radical Robots camp for grades K-5, for which he planned and supervised STEAM activities for kids.  So, although it seemed that he might pursue engineering, it was no surprise to anyone when he decided to study Media Arts and Science (MAS) in college at Luddy Indianapolis. Lovrinic specialized in Digital Storytelling and then added Game Design midway through. A summer job with IUPUI day camp gave him more insight into working with children, although he did not think of it as a career path at the time. He also taught a kids summer camp in robotics at the Johnson County Public Library, adding to his repertoire.  [Media Arts and Science](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/undergraduate/media-arts/)  “I’ve always been drawn to charitable applications of technology especially when tackling difficult and demotivating problems with fresh eyes and an ambition for what’s possible,” Lovrinic said.  Early in his senior year, Lovrinic was beginning his job search and was offered a position at Riley Hospital  for Children as Technology Coordinator, which he accepted before his last semester. This move actually inspired his Capstone project—a VR game experience for young patients designed to entertain them during treatments, which also served to distract them from painful or boring procedures.  [Riley Hospital  for Children](https://www.rileychildrens.org/contact-and-locations/riley-hospital-for-children-at-iu-health)   ### Life at Riley  As Technology Coordinator in the Child Life Zone , Lovrinic is responsible for supporting digital media at the hospital. During COVID this meant finding ways to conduct activities remotely. He hosts Tech Tuesday with Jake online for example, and helps with virtual Bingo and other activities led by staff in the Child Life Zone. He has also supported Riley Foundation initiatives such as the annual Miracle Ride and the Dance Marathon, creating a 3D printed motorcycle and a camera-equipped robot.  [Child Life Zone](https://www.rileychildrens.org/support-services/child-life)  During his onboarding and in the year and a half since, Lovrinic has been immersed in the pediatric healthcare environment, learning about dialysis and observing other treatments and surgeries. One of his early projects was to design, CAD, and print a replica of the port device many small patients have in their chest for medicine delivery. When discharged to home, the kids take the replica with them to show their families and educate them on what it is.    Lovrinic’s office at Riley has a large glass window that looks out on the hallway that families take with young patients, where he has installed a small train layout that kids can operate via a magnetic button on the outside of the wall. He has also modified game controllers in patient rooms for single-handed use and has made changes to PowerWheels so that they can be run safely indoors at the hospital.  Lovrinic said, “Even being a relatively young person myself, it’s apparent to me that kids are the future especially because the kids I work with now will be adults in the community in just a few years. It’s important to me that everyone has agency to interact with the built world we live in; that’s why I think STEM activities and adaptive technologies are so important.”  His latest endeavors at Riley led to his involvement with students from Luddy IUPUI. Lovrinic stayed in contact with his Capstone mentor and MAS faculty, Zebulun Wood , and when Wood reached out for industry partners for his N420 class, Lovrinic responded with not one, but three projects for collaboration.  [Zebulun Wood](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/zeb-wood/)   ### Student Projects  Lovrinic shared that Riley has been a great place to work because they are open to innovation and will share why something hasn’t worked in the past rather than assuming it can never work in the future. “There are tons of things that just haven’t been tried because it’s never been possible to modify them to the hospital environment before 3D printing, dev boards, and openness to innovation,” he said.  Wood said, “Mr. Lovrinic and his peers at Riley were outstanding ‘Client Collaborators’ in partnership with our N420 Multimedia Project Development class.  Throughout the semester, he and his colleagues met to present the problem needing solving (by our students), follow up on our students’ proposals, and give feedback frequently to ensure success and happy delivery!  Our student teams performed exceptionally well this semester across the board; a special bonus is when we can help the exceptional team at Riley, and the families served. Thanks, Jake, for the pairings!  Please keep them coming!”  [grid size=”thirds’]  [/grid]   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

I’ve had a love for technology and art my entire life, so when I heard about MAS, I asked myself, ‘Why am I not doing that instead?’ I switched majors as soon as I could. I instantly knew that Media Arts and Science was suitable for me.” It proved to be an excellent fit, and Adam shifted his focus to the offerings of the MAS program. “I can’t overstate how much I enjoyed my time at SOIC. I loved my professors and appreciated their genuine care for their students’ growth. There are many great ones, but I’ll never forget Thomas Lewis and Rodney Smith’s classes. I specialized in Video Production and Sound Design within MAS, and some of my favorite experiences were in the video and sound-related classes. My favorites were Directorial Analysis, Lighting and Field, Advanced Sound Design, and Multimedia Project Development. I’ll never forget the first time I rigged up a cinema camera on a crane or the first time I directed a short film. I loved exploring other classes in web development and graphic design as well.”  This well-rounded education in Media Arts directly lead to his involvement with 1st Maker Space, which began while Adam was earning his degree. “Kim Brand, their founder, taught my Media and Tech Entrepreneurship class in 2019, and that’s how I got involved with 1st Maker Space. I did some light freelance work for the company back then, and now we work together regularly.” Adam recalls. “1st Maker Space has designed, built, and sustained over 100 makerspaces across the state. They design the classrooms, make the furniture from scratch, install the equipment, resupply the consumables, provide professional development, and provide a curriculum for teachers to teach their students. Originally, 1MS distributed the curriculum manually in a PDF or spiral-bound textbook format. As a result, it was hard for them to update their curricula because it required them to manually send out new versions to the schools that purchased them. I adapted the contents of their curricula into a series of interactive web pages that are accessible through a member-based subscription service. Every lesson includes pictures, instructional videos, downloadable assets, and easy-to-use navigation for each of the 90 lesson plans. Teachers can find what they need quickly and teach their students more effectively with the new format.” As a freelancer, Adam’s association with 1st Maker Space continues to this day: he designed their website, and produced some of the videos and photos on the site.  Adam was highly in demand in the local IT workforce, and he lined up an exciting job the summer prior to his final semester here. “In August, I accepted an Ecommerce Coordinator position at a Noblesville-based phone case company called Scooch. I manage our Amazon store, website, email marketing, social media, and advertising. I also designed our new website (ScoochCase.com). Now that I’ve found a stable job that I like, I’ve slowed down on freelance work, and I’m focused on furthering my experience in ecommerce and digital marketing. I still create video content to supplement my work. I couldn’t be more thankful that SOIC prepared me for this job and what’s still to come.” Adam says. He believes adaptability will be a key skill to have in the IT workforce in the future.  “What excites me most about Media Arts and Human-Centered Computing is that these fields are evolving rapidly. Current Media Arts students are preparing themselves for jobs that may not exist today. Teaching students to be adaptable and versatile is essential to our future. I loved working with 1st Maker Space because makerspaces also teach students to be curious learners, engineers, coders, and forward-thinkers from a young age. I’m excited to see how technology and new media help small businesses grow, and students flourish. My education has taught me that, to an extent, it’s good for our future to be open-ended. We shouldn’t restrict ourselves to a single end goal or a career path full of expectations. Five years ago, I never knew I’d like ecommerce, building websites, or working with small businesses; I just knew that I liked technology. So I kept an open mind, and the rest followed. I’m going to keep the same mentality with whatever comes my way.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Student data privacy starts with a cooperative spirit, says SoIC professor  December 13, 2022  What level of privacy should students expect? And are college and universities prepared to deliver?  IU’s Kyle Jones, Ph.D., researches student privacy issues. He and his team have interviewed students and examined how their data is collected and used in higher education. Going forward, it’s crucial to involve students in the data collection process, says Jones, an associate professor of library and information science at the IU School of Informatics and Computing in Indianapolis.  “We shouldn’t be using students as unknowing research subjects,” he says.  In his paper “The Datafied Student: Why Students’ Data Privacy Matters and the Responsibility to Protect It,” Jones examines the evolution of student data privacy, and ways to improve. Earlier this year the Future of Privacy Forum, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, published Jones’ report of his research.   ### Privacy and power  “The increasing collection of student data raises red flags about whether such practices invade privacy,” Jones writes, and other issues, “such as the potential for bias, racial and other discrimination.”  Even more notable, he adds, is the power that institutions gain over their students, capturing student life and behaviors in “mandated digital learning systems and tracking students’ locations via radio-frequency identification chips in their university ID cards.”  Concerns about student privacy are increasing, he says, as higher education institutions develop ways to mine and analyze student and educational data – data, he says, that has the potential to harm students’ education and job prospects.  “Privacy is an instrumental element of higher education’s commitment to intellectual freedom,” Jones writes.  “Students in higher education need intellectual privacy protections to uphold their intellectual freedom now more than ever,” he notes, citing the issues of institutional surveillance and learning analytics.   ### Are the benefits worth it?  Colleges and universities scrutinize student data for many reasons. The practice, known as learning analytics, began around 2010. Higher education officials claim it can increase efficiency, save money, and benefit students by improving teaching, learning outcomes, and student support.  But, Jones notes, the facts don’t necessarily support those claims—especially when weighed against privacy concerns, and the financial toll that investing in learning analytics takes on public institutions.  “The weak benefits of learning analytics lead us to question whether investments in data infrastructures,” he writes, “outweigh the real harms, primarily those regarding student data privacy.”  And there isn’t much of a track record to evaluate. “Educational data mining and learning analytics is still a fledgling field,” Jones says. “In due time—using vetted, empirical research that protects participants from privacy harms—we may see real, useful gains that can improve learning.  “We shouldn’t be buying vended solutions without substantiated evidence supporting corporate PR claims.”   ### A path forward  To align with the privacy protections and ethical practices that students and other stakeholders expect, Jones says higher education institutions must commit to:   ### Benefit analysis and buy-in  “Students are expected to be always on, to stay connected to their university’s network, to access, to consume, to share information—and to manage their lives,” Jones writes.  “Universities continue to advance their networking technologies in order to become smart universities equipped with an assemblage of sensors, cameras, and so-called intelligent voice assistants (e.g., Apple’s Siri, Google’s Alexa) to capture, analyze, and act on an array of data.”  To protect student privacy, Jones adds, “The academic community must rethink the development and evolution of learning analytics … and must actively participate in the design of learning analytics tools and the goals at which they are directed.  “No successful implementation of learning analytics infrastructures and artifacts is possible unless faculty, staff, administration—and, yes, students—frame their construction according to the core educational mission and with a shared, collective vision.”  Jones’ previous research, which included interviewing more than 100 students on how they feel about privacy, has revealed that they hold their universities to a higher standard than social media or eCommerce sites.  “The most trustworthy and privacy-protecting learning analytics applications,” he says, “will be designed with students, whose voices can help researchers and technologists understand what privacy protections need to be in place.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

Lecturer, Media Arts and Science Director, Multidevice Web & Mobile Development Certificate Program   ### Contact  trshelto@iupui.edu 317-278-9203 IT 440J  [IT 440J](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=535+W.+Michigan+St.+Indianapolis+IN+46202-3103)   ### Related Links  [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/tweenout)   ### Education   ### Biography  Todd Shelton loves to teach and share his web development knowledge with others. He is always creating tutorial videos that demonstrate how to create and develop web projects for public use. Although he primarily develops in Flex/Flash Builder, he also has developed various PHP/HTML/MySQL projects.  A contributor for the RIA RockStars site, Shelton runs the local Flash Indianapolis users group. When not at work, he enjoys physical computing and developing projects using AS3 in interactive spaces and large areas.  Before becoming an instructor at our school, he worked at Herff Jones Inc. as an application developer. While at Herff Jones, Shelton gained knowledge in MVC, Java, and several server-side languages. After completing his master’s, he joined the SOIC faculty.  But Shelton’s interest in web development came after a long career in music. In California he attended the Musicians Institute in Hollywood, majoring in guitar performance. Later he went to Berklee College of Music in Boston, specializing in recording and engineering. He also attended the Recording Workshop in Chillicothe, Ohio, and recorded local artists after he completed his education.  Deciding to explore a new career in web development, Shelton obtained his bachelor’s degree from the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering in 2008, focusing on web and Flash development, then worked as a Flash developer for The Basement Design & Motion marketing agency in Indianapolis. He advanced to a senior developer position, working on several award-winning projects.  Shelton also has been an adjunct instructor at the Art Institute of Indianapolis, teaching scripting classes and portfolio development.   ### Courses  NEWM N115 Introduction to Multi-Device Web Development  [NEWM N115](https://luddy.iupui.edu/courses/newm-n115/)  NEWM N215 Intermediate Multi-Device Web Development  [NEWM N215](https://luddy.iupui.edu/courses/newm-n215/)  NEWM N315 Advanced Multi-Device Web Development  [NEWM N315](https://luddy.iupui.edu/courses/newm-n315/)  NEWM N322 Dynamic Data Applications  [NEWM N322](https://luddy.iupui.edu/courses/newm-n322/)  NEWM N399 Portfolio Development  [NEWM N399](https://luddy.iupui.edu/courses/newm-n399/)  NEWM N423 Database Development for Mobile Applications  [NEWM N423](https://luddy.iupui.edu/courses/newm-n423/)  NEWM N436 Game Production  [NEWM N436](https://luddy.iupui.edu/courses/newm-n436/)   ### Related News "

    "body": "  ### Doctor of Philosophy in Informatics / Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Track   ### Summary timeline  First year:  Second year:  Third year and beyond:   ### The Annual Review  All HCI Ph.D. students will be reviewed by the HCI area research faculty on an annual basis. The purpose of this review is twofold.  First, the review affords the faculty an opportunity to holistically evaluate student growth and progress toward candidacy or defense of dissertation. Students in the program are expected to exhibit consistent progress in expanding their domain knowledge, developing their analytic and critical thinking skills, adopting an effective research mentality, engaging in the scholarly community both within and beyond the department, and honing their presentation and communication skills.  Second, the review provides the faculty an opportunity to provide feedback to students to help improve the quality, rigor, professionalism, and publishability of their scholarly work.   ### The Annual Review Committee  All tenured and tenure-track HCI faculty will serve as members of the annual review committee.   ### Research Portfolio  Each year, all students in the Ph.D. program will submit a portfolio reflecting their academic progress over the course of the previous year.   ### One:  Portfolios should represent a comprehensive self-assessment, emphasizing scholarship, teaching, coursework, service, and professional activity. Taken together, the materials submitted as part of a student’s portfolio should summarize a year of work and include an overview of the student’s progress on their plan of study.   ### Two:  The documents to submit as part of the Yearly Research Portfolio are the following:  A. Research Statement: This should combine (i) a summary of your research agenda, and (ii) reflection on your progress towards the next major milestone in the program (qualifying exams, proposal, or defense).  -- Research Agenda (1-2 pages) describing:  1. The major research questions you aim to answer through your work 2. Your methodological approach and positioning within the field of HCI  -- Research Self-Assessmen t (1-2 pages), describing: 1. Research goals for the upcoming year, and plan for accomplishing them 2. Areas you feel strong in, and areas you feel you need to grow in for the next semester. Please discuss both academic research development and general professional development    B. Up-to-date Curriculum Vitae, clearly identifying new accomplishments in the last  year, including:  -- Faculty advisor(s), committee members, and selected minor degree (if  decided)  -- Progress with respect to the Ph.D. Plan of Study, including completed  coursework  -- New accomplishments, including:  1. Generated scholarship (e.g., publications, presentations, studies  planned, in progress, or completed, contributions to research grants)  2. Teaching activity (if any)  3. Contribution to service (school/dept, profession, organizations)    C. Copy of all proposals and publications submitted or in preparation during the previous year    You are expected to share with your Ph.D. advisor a full draft of your portfolio at least two weeks before the submission deadline for feedback and guidance.  Each document must also indicate clearly the student’s name , the current research advisor , and the semester of first enrollment in the program .  The portfolio should be submitted electronically in PDF portfolio format (1 file) to the graduate program coordinator, Elizabeth Cassell (cassell@iupui.edu). Submissions are due by the last day of classes of the spring semester.  As part of the annual review process, faculty may ask the candidate to provide additional information or clarification as necessary.   ### Results and Dates   ## First-Year Review  Students completing their first year in the Ph.D. program will receive a more thorough review in order to provide them with early feedback on their ability to perform successfully in a Ph.D. program.  In order to provide first-year students with more time to settle into the program and gain experience participating as a member of one (or more) research group(s), the annual review for first-year students will take place at the end of the summer term (instead of the beginning). This extended submission deadline provides students an opportunity to include work completed as part of research rotations or independent study courses in their portfolio materials.   ### Research Portfolio   ### Oral Research Presentation  As part of the first-year review, each student will give a 15-minute oral presentation of the research included in his or her portfolio to the members of the HCI research faculty. This presentation should clearly communicate the student’s role in and specific contributions to one (or more) research project(s) completed during his or her first year in the program.  Students should be prepared to answer questions about their research from the faculty at the conclusion of their presentation. At the end of the oral presentation, students will have the opportunity to ask questions to the faculty.  As part of the review process, faculty may ask the candidate to provide additional information or clarification as necessary.   ### Results and Dates  For any question on the annual review process, please refer to the chair of the Department of Human-Centered Computing, Dr. Andrew Miller ( andrewm@iupui.edu ).

    "body": "  ## Students plot out the parks of tomorrow in Design Sprint competition  April 27, 2023  Luddy Indianapolis students raced to the finish during a pair of “Parks of the Future” Design Sprint challenges this March. Teams of students earning master’s degrees in Human-Computer Interaction envisioned how public recreation spaces might one day feature messages from the past, co-working spaces, holograms, perfume creation, and dancing in the moonlight at a silent disco.  [Human-Computer Interaction](https://luddy.iupui.edu/hcc/graduate/hci/masters/)  Held in partnership with IU’s Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering in Indianapolis, and Indy Parks and Recreation, the Design Sprint competitions were March 8 and March 31. Nearly $3,000 in scholarship funds was distributed among the winners.  Student teams accepted the challenge to dream big as they envisioned what the parks of the future could look like, and how they would serve the public. About 60 graduate students worked with parks and recreation employees, visited city parks, and had just two weeks to come up with their concepts.   ### Support and guidance  “We are very grateful for our partnership with Indy Parks and Recreation,” says retired Luddy Indianapolis professor Steve Mannheimer, who led the Design Sprint. “Director Phyllis Boyd, and assistant directors Don Colvin and Kim Campbell (and two other senior staff) participated in informative sessions and also judging the final presentations.”  All of the student teams repeatedly acknowledged their gratitude for the invaluable help and support they received from Mannheimer. They also expressed their thanks for the assistance they received from Boyd, Colvin, Campbell, and other Indy Parks staff.   ### Design Sprint No. 1  First place: “ Memory Park” and “Night Activities,” from Kshitij Patil, Pravallika Navuluru, and Varuun Pochampally  “Memory Park,” Patil notes, “is a haven for people to cherish memories and experiences with their loved ones, transcending the constraints of time and space with the magic of communication.”  The team members envisioned a future park “using technology to record personal greetings from relatives and friends, geo-pinning these messages to specific objects and places in a park.”  Bringing the party to the park, they said “Night Activities” would light up the night, “perhaps including the ‘silent disco’ concept, where groups of people use earbuds to hear the same music.”   ### Design Sprint No. 2  First place: “Hues and Aromas,” by Hemanth Pawar and Manali Parab  Parab described their project as “a unique concept that aimed to create an immersive sensory experience that would attract visitors to the park by leveraging the botanical heritage of Indiana through activities like natural dye painting and perfume making.”  “We aimed to create unique and personal experiences encouraging visitors to form lasting memories in the parks,” Pawar added.   ### Professor’s Choice  The team of Shreyas Patel, Drishti Jogadia, Aditya Nair, and Nisarg Rajpura received the Professor’s Choice award for their interrelated concepts to expand the experience of Dr. Martin Luther King Park in Indianapolis, home of the “Landmark for Peace” memorial, which honors King and Robert F. Kennedy.   ### “Parks of the Future” winning entries  [accordion order=”first”]   ### Design Sprint No. 1 (March 8, 2023)  1st place: “Memory park and night activities,” from Kshitij Patil, Pravallika Navuluru, and Varuun Pochampally 2nd place: “Holograms, table-top games, adult playground,” from Sanjukta Choudhary and Mency Lobo  3rd place: “Health through nutrition and stress relief,” from Ravi Shankar Kunapuli and Sangeetha Parthasarathi  4th place: “Musical playground and geo-fencing,” from Laura Levine, Uzoamaka Nwaiwu, Nithika Sanghi, and Manvish Paladugu  Honorable Mention: Various concepts were proposed by Arati Ghimire, Ching-Min Tseng, Ritu Harish Salian, Tarun Sarana, Sai Koya, Jai Thota, and Shanmukhi Damerla.

    "body": "  ## $237K Navy grant funds 3-D simulation research  September 30, 2016  Researchers from the Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing (SOIC) at IUPUI and the Electrical Engineering Department (ECE) at the Purdue School of Engineering and Technology at IUPUI received a $237K grant from the Office of Naval Research for improving the effectiveness of military training by advancing the state of the art in 3-D visualization of radio frequency (RF) signals in the existing battlefield simulation environment.  Faculty members Albert William (SOIC) and Lauren Christopher (ECE) designed the research project to balance STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) research and educational tasks, with the goal of strengthening existing collaborations between SOIC, ECE, and the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC-Crane).  Electronic simulations are an important tool for military training—and stereoscopic, or 3-D, viewing significantly improves performance. However, there is no current representation of the radio frequency (RF) signals that are important to understanding battlefield conditions. RF is used to communicate with and locate moving assets, such as planes, ships, and missiles. The new visualization will include an indication of when the assets are within reliable range of each other.  The collaboration will improve the Navy’s Electronic Warfare (EW) training environment and deliver 3-D enhancements to NSWC-Crane for testing and validation. “This collaboration grew out of my visiting faculty summer position at NSWC-Crane and contact with current and past IUPUI students now working there.” Christopher said.  The research also seeks to educate a supply of excellent STEM graduates for years to come. A 3-D Electronic Warfare Visualization laboratory will be established under the direction of William and Christopher. Another key component is a new course that combines RF and EW expertise with 3-D visualization. The project-based course will be developed and taught at the college level, targeted for informatics and engineering students.  “We have hoped for some time to work with NSWC-Crane and are pleased to have the opportunity to collaborate with them on this project, developing this technology along with our students,” William said.  The ongoing collaboration with NSWC-Crane will lead to summer internships for the students involved with the research. Additionally, the plan for this course is to make it available online, so it can be used in guided or stand-alone training for existing NSWC-Crane employees.  The School of Informatics and Computing Department of Human-Centered Computing has strong expertise in 3-D visualization and media production. Informatics students will develop dynamic skills in 3-D visualization, and in designing and producing computer graphics applied to military training goals.  The Electrical and Computer Engineering Department features research programs in signal processing and RF for EW. Engineering students will gain a deep understanding of RF signals—a key to understanding EW environments.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

Then in 2018 and 2019, Fulton—now a junior in the Media Arts and Science program at the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI—was a finalist in the Songbook Academy , a week-long summer intensive at the Center for Performing Arts in Carmel, IN.  [Media Arts and Science program](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/undergraduate/media-arts/)  [Songbook Academy](https://thesongbook.org/programs/the-songbook-academy)  [Center for Performing Arts](https://thecenterpresents.org/)  Through that singing experience, Fulton met Director of Education and Community Engagement Julia Shildmyer-Heighway, who told him about the graphic design internship at the Center. During his internship, Fulton designed brochures, social media posts, and upcoming artist posters that were displayed on monitors in the Palladium. These projects improved his skills, made him more comfortable with the software, and taught him the nuances of creating digital and print graphics. “It’s really fulfilling to see how my work was used,” Fulton says. “I’ve designed graphics for many organizations, but never to this scale!”  Fulton’s post-college goal is to work at a game company as either a UX/UI designer or 3D character artist. For now he is focused on building his portfolio. “It’s so satisfying to create objects out of thin air, and doing it digitally means I can experiment with my art without making a mess,” he says.  He says that through his internship he also learned what type of artist he is, preferring to edit down large bodies of information rather than expanding on a small idea.  His advice to others is, “If you’ve seen an internship that you’d like, don’t wait to apply! And if you’ve got connections with professionals, don’t be afraid to ask for help! The worst thing that could happen is ‘no.’ And the best thing that could happen is a life-changing, career-enhancing experience.”       ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Health Informatics alumna wins RADxx Rising Star award  January 10, 2018  IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI alumna Judy Wawira Gichoya is a recent recipient of the RADxx Rising Star award. Gichoya graduated with an M.S. in Health Informatics after completing medical school in Kenya, and will finish her radiology residency at the IU School of Medicine in June, 2018.  The RADxx awards recognize the achievements of women in the field of medical imaging informatics, as well as anyone—both men and women—who has helped and supported women in medical imaging informatics.  “Learning informatics was crucial to my career as I have been able to contribute to radiology nationally in many ways, including structured reporting, and now head the new Artificial Intelligence Journal club for residents across the country,” Gichoya says. “Having a good base of knowledge of informatics helped me understand how to apply informatics to radiology and get a head start in my clinical career.”  While completing her master’s degree, Gichoya worked with health informatics professors Josette Jones and Brian Dixon, among others, and with Regenstrief institute faculty, who taught her the basics of doing research and understanding informatics. According to Gichoya, the challenge of informatics is to gain a solid grasp of concepts in order to jump to the future as soon as possible. She explains that it is very difficult to do this with classwork alone and that lab work helps bridge to new trends that prepare students for the job market.  Gichoya came to the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI early in its history, and notes that there are even more opportunities available to students now. One of these is the Purkayastha Laboratory, where she is currently a research associate.  “At the lab, students are placed in teams to work on real-life projects, from interviewing patients to clinical implementation of systems. Students report weekly on updates and thereafter are helped to submit papers for publication and conference presentation,” Gichoya says. “Most informatics programs will teach you theory of informatics and stop there. If you are curious and yearning to learn, resources in and around the School of Informatics and Computing, including the medical school, the IU Health hospital system, the Regenstrief Institute, and programs within the school will prepare you for the workforce,” she says.  Gichoya’s advice to students is to put in hard work and take advantage of the opportunities provided. And, she adds, since the health informatics graduate courses are in the evening, use the day to learn more and network with others.     ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## What’s in your bag? IUPUI senior creates digital paintings and prosthetic designs  April 12, 2018  ( Originally published April 12, 2018. Written by Tim Brouk )  When Jordan Nelsen was a small child, she picked up a pencil and paper and began to draw, just like any kid.  A few years later, Nelsen began drawing with a pen-shaped stylus, pen tablet and laptop computer. Since elementary school, Nelsen has balanced digital drawing with “analog.” Now a senior in the Herron School of Art and Design and the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, she still carries a paper sketchbook but the digital equipment takes up more room in her backpack.  With her left hand on hot keys for erasing and choosing different brushes in programs like ZBrush, Geomagic Design X and Photoshop, Nelsen’s digital work has brought her high praise at Herron. She has assembled a portfolio of figurative fantasy pieces aimed at the video gaming industry.  Nelsen’s ability to translate her designs into 3-D pieces was honed through her classes as a Media Arts and Science (MAS) major at the School of Informatics and Computing (SoIC), and through research projects under the guidance of Zebulun Wood, co-director of the MAS undergraduate program.  The anatomical foundation of her art talents has led to life-enhancing opportunities for dental patients. A summer-school informatics and computing class with School of Dentistry maxillofacial prosthodontics resident Dr. Travis Bellicchi led to more than a dozen facial prosthetic designs the last couple of years. A 2017 nose for a cancer patient, which took her only four hours to produce, made regional news.  “Depending on the case, they can take months to complete,” Nelsen explained. “But we scanned him, we designed it, and we had it on the 3-D printer ready to go for him the next day. It happened a lot quicker than everyone thought. It was a good feeling to get that done in an unprecedented amount of time.”    “It’s one thing to paint something for myself and feel really good about it,” said Nelsen, who moved to Carmel while in high school. “It’s an entirely alien feeling to be able to say, ‘I made this thing that somebody is wearing to help improve their way of life.’ There is no feeling that’s like that.”  Set to graduate in May, Nelsen hopes to still pursue both gaming and prosthetics.  “I like to find a nice balance between the two,” Nelsen said, “from helping people and painting for myself as well.”  While she only needs three pieces of equipment to create a new video game character or new dentures to be installed into the zygomatic bone of a School of Dentistry patient, Nelsen’s backpack carries her latest work and her future career — or careers.

    "body": "  ## Jennifer Palilonis Alumni Spotlight  July 11, 2019  Jennifer Palilonis was a self-described non-traditional Ph.D. student in the Human-Computer Interaction program at the IU School of Informatics and Computing (SoIC) at IUPUI in 2010. At the time, she was already a tenured professor at Ball State University, teaching full time, married with young children, and commuting from Muncie for classes. Prior to that she had been working as a journalist and had never contemplated a Ph.D. in that field, saying “I learned about the SoIC at IU and suddenly a whole new set of possibilities surfaced.”  She says, “I always tell people, I didn’t get a Ph.D. because I needed the degree, I got the Ph.D. because I was really interested in learning the subject matter….” Palilonis says the HCI degree is relevant to journalism because much of that field has been dramatically affected by the web, especially visual journalism. She adds that digital product development is in fact a huge focus in many media environments and HCI has a lot to offer, especially when it comes to teaching students interested in building cross-platform experiences.  Palilonis, who completed her Ph.D. in 2015, says the experience was exhausting and challenging, but she was careful to avoid the “I can’t wait until this is over mentality,” instead taking each semester, each class, each day, each assignment one moment at a time to avoid being overwhelmed. She says she loved all of her classes—especially her research rotations—and applied what she was learning to her own research. HCC Department Chair Davide Bolchini was the chair of her dissertation committee. “I also had several classes with him and consider him a great mentor and collaborator,” she says.  Her path to SoIC began after graduating from Ball State with her degree in journalism and then working at the Detroit Free Press and the Chicago Sun-Times in various positions. Along the way she instructed a newspaper design class at Wayne State University, which led to an adjunct position in Chicago and teaching summer High School Journalism Workshops at Ball State. In 2001, she applied for the position of Instructor and Journalism Graphics Sequence coordinator at Ball State, earning tenure in 2009. In 2015, Palilonis launched the Center for Emerging Media Design & Development. EMDD is a graduate program and undergraduate major focused on design thinking, transmedia storytelling, and human-computer interaction. She has also been a media design consultant, redesigning more than 30 newspapers and news websites across the country.  “…our approach to HCI is through the lens of strategic communication and experience design. There’s a ton of opportunity for people in those fields to expand their knowledge, skillsets, and ability to innovate when they add principles and practices of HCI, like usability, user experience, user-centered design, etc. to their repertoire,” Palilonis explains.  Palilonis is now involved in several high-profile projects: developing a cross-platform exhibition for David Letterman memorabilia shared with Ball State that chronicles his life and career; developing a digital literacy curriculum for grades K-5 for the Professor Garfield’s 21st Century Literacy Project, a partnership between EMDD, the Professor Garfield Foundation, and Jim Davis; and developing a documentary on the growth of boys’ and men’s’ volleyball in the U.S., a collaborative effort between EMDD, the USA men’s Olympic volleyball team, and the First Point Volleyball Foundation.  Also of note was her leadership of the Blue Roots Project, a partnership with Circle of Blue, a non-profit that covers the global water and energy crisis. Her students developed a social media campaign and design challenge that collected stories from around the world on the value of water in people’s lives. The team was invited to Rome to assist with World Water Day at the Vatican.  In 2012-13, Palilonis was honored with the National Journalism & Mass Communication Teacher of the Year: Charles E. Scripps Award by the Scripps Howard Foundation. In August 2019, she will receive the Ball State’s Rawlings Outstanding Distance Education Teaching Award, which honors the “faculty member who has proven to be the most dedicated to teaching extended education courses at off-campus distance education sites.” This is in recognition of the development and success of the EMDD low-residency program for mid-career professionals that is partially online and partially taught at the BSU Fishers Center for Academic and Economic Innovation.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

His work recently has included collaborating on COVID-19 research to develop new diagnostic tests for rapid detection of the viral strain.  [COVID-19 research to develop new diagnostic tests](https://luddy.iupui.edu/news/story/janga-covid-19-diagnostic)  Janga also has been examining the fields of epitranscriptomics, exploring RNA modifications: the factors that ultimately control the fate of protein production as DNA is transcribed to RNA and then translated to proteins, and how genes are regulated in a cell at post-transcriptional level by RNA-binding proteins as well as long non-coding RNAs.  More broadly, the Janga Lab of Genomics and Systems Biology is developing computational approaches to mine complex and heterogeneous data sources, which are publicly available in biomedical sciences.   #### From data to diagnosis  Exploring the possibilities of artificial intelligence and machine learning, the lab examines the phenotypic landscape of an organism and its relevance to disease conditions. To achieve this goal, researchers exploit diverse sources of data that stem from a burgeoning number of high-throughput technologies, to turn this information into valuable knowledge.  Janga and the lab’s researchers also generate experimental data in genomic sciences, and develop new types of data analysis methods—as well as algorithms—to extract, mine, and analyze such complex data sets to facilitate novel technology development for stratification and diagnosis in cancer and neurological diseases.  Early in his career, Janga helped to shape an understanding of the structure and dynamics of bacterial gene regulatory networks, working in Mexico with the group of Dr. Julio Collado-Vides at the Laboratory of Computational Genomics in Center for Genomic Sciences at UNAM in Cuernavaca. This was followed by doctoral work in England on exploiting network-based approaches in studying cellular networks at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Darwin College, University of Cambridge, with Drs. Madan Babu and Sarah Teichmann.  Janga was an Institute for Genomic Biology Fellow at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign, working on applying computational and systems approaches to mine metagenomic samples for identifying novel antibacterial pathways and compounds during his post-doctoral period (2010-2012).   ### Research Interests  Professor Janga’s research integrates computational and experimental multi-omic approaches to study complex and heterogeneous data sources in biomedical sciences, with the goal of understanding how the regulation, structure and dynamics of biological systems shape the phenotypic landscape of an organism and its relevance to disease conditions. His interdisciplinary research team in collaboration with clinical and translational scientists, examines these questions using cutting edge next generation sequencing technologies and data science frameworks to develop novel bioinformatics algorithms to understand how RNA interactions, structures and their cross talk with various cellular entities in cell lines and animal models can be employed for dissecting complex phenotypes in liver, brain, kidney and immune diseases.   ### Classes  INFO B619 Structural Bioinformatics  [INFO B619](https://luddy.iupui.edu/courses/info-b619/)  INFO B656 Translational Bioinformatics Applications  [INFO B656](https://luddy.iupui.edu/courses/info-b656/)   ### Related News "

    "body": "  ## Grant supports four faculty in preserving church’s 180-year heritage  February 10, 2017  Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI faculty members Andrea Copeland, Albert William, Zebulun Wood, and Ayoung Yoon received a New Frontiers of Creativity and Scholarship Award in the amount of $57,043 from the IU Office of the Vice President for Research for their unique collaboration in archival preservation and 3-D virtual environments.  Their project, “Virtual Bethel: Underrepresented History and Primary Source Education through Virtual Reality,” is “a wonderful demonstration of the interplay between informatics and digital archiving,” said Executive Associate Dean Mathew J. Palakal, School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI .  Take a Virtual Tour  Within weeks of a plan to close the doors on the Indianapolis Bethel AME (African Methodist Episcopal) Church, faculty and an alumnus from the Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI worked to save the historic church’s troves of archival documents and objects. Out of this significant contribution to the city’s storied past comes something for the future—a virtual 3-D walk-through of the church that will be open for public use—re-created by faculty and students from the School of Informatics and Computing.  Founded in 1836, the Bethel AME Church played vital roles in the Underground Railroad, the founding of Indiana’s NAACP, and the School for Black Children in Indianapolis. Parishioner Frances Connecticut Stout started the collection of U.S. records for the church in 1940. Those records were later cared for by Olivia McGee-Lockhart, a lifelong member of the church.  Baptismal records, tithing records, $1.35 in change from a collection—these preserved items are among the many objects that will tell a rich and vibrant story that includes Madam C.J. Walker and many other prominent Black residents of Indianapolis who attended Bethel AME.  All this was in danger of being lost—possibly forever—until IU School of Informatics and Computing alumnus Rodney Freeman, a library administrator and founder of Project Back-Up, initiated a plan to save the records. Andrea Copeland, a faculty member in the Library and Information Science (LIS) program at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, provided additional assistance, along with LIS alumna Kisha Tandy and Wilma Moore of the Indiana Historical Society (IHS).  For the past three years, containers of records, memoirs, and memorabilia have been painstakingly recorded and organized into 200 archival boxes by Tandy and Moore at the IHS.  Copeland, who has researched and written on the topic of participatory heritage, recognized the importance of preserving the church’s history for future generations. “The Internet has democratized our ‘story’. We don’t need to have credentials to understand its value. At the same time, we don’t want archives and libraries to become irrelevant—we need to have open access. We hope to build a system that connects community to resources as a model of shared expertise and respect,” Copeland said.  School of Informatics and Computing faculty members Zebulun Wood and Albert William of the Media Arts and Science program have years of experience creating 3-D models in virtual environments. Wood reached out to his colleagues at Online Resources in Lebanon, Indiana, to 3-D scan the chapel within weeks of the church’s public access deadline. Students from the 3D Production class, offered in the fall semester at the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, photographed every square inch of the church—3,000 images were created for referencing during the 3-D modeling process.  When complete,  the 3-D model will be publicly accessible from the School of Informatics and Computing and the digital images used to create it will be housed at the IUPUI Library. The digitized archive will reside at the IHS along with the original archival records.  Ayoung Yoon, assistant professor in the LIS program, was consulted on the project because of her research interest in the emerging field of digital preservation and data curation. Yoon’s work focuses on the long-term impact of environment and technology integration on the archival process and digital preservation. “There is not just one solution. We have a lot to learn,” Yoon said.  Because the Bethel AME endeavor was perfectly aligned with the course Wood and William were teaching, students were integral to the work. “It is exciting to consider these projects as an outlet for student work,” Wood said. “Having a niche in virtual reality for historical preservation is a great prospect for our students.”  Wood, William, and their students will go on to create a detailed virtual learning space, complete with blue stained glass windows, an authentic re-creation of the pulpit and chair from the church, and various documents. A bare-bones, first version of the space has already been designed. It was well-received by the members of the church and IHS team, who were invited for a virtual walk-through.  Digital virtual experiences of archival materials lower barriers to access and are friendlier for users. The technology provides new inroads for all to understand the history that surrounds them.  Together, Yoon, Wood, Copeland, and William will work to make sure the digitized images are available in perpetuity. “We can assume in 20 to 30 years the assets we’re using now will be gone. We won’t know what devices we will be using—inputs and outputs are ever-changing,” Wood said.  The Bethel AME work exposed faculty and students to an incredible historic community landmark that existed right next to the IUPUI campus. For students, the project is also an opportunity to work on something that gives back to the community and leaves a mark on the future. As William said, “Digital technology helps us understand history and our cultural heritage. I have lived here for years, and now that I know, it’s amazing.”  “Virtual reality replications of historical sites are becoming more common,” said Wood. “We can now walk in, interact with, and learn from the past. I hope that these experiences, remade by our students, connect to people in a lasting way. It has enriched all of us in the process.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## HCI grad student pitches new idea for deaf-blind community to win JagStart  May 2, 2018  Madhura Mhatre, a graduate student in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) program at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, recently won the JagStart Elevator Pitch Competition at IUPUI for her concept, Braille Tech. Mhatre received a prize of $2500, which she will use to further research and develop her innovation for the deaf-blind community.  JagStart is an annual event that pits contestants against the clock to pitch their original ideas to a panel of industry judges, and is open to all IUPUI students. Participants learn valuable skills and receive coaching and feedback.  Braille Tech consists of a glove, outfitted with sensors and a mechanism for converting digital braille on a smart phone to a tactile impulse that is felt by the fingers, mechanically replicating the familiar raised dot pattern. Although there are other technologies available like refreshable braille displays, they are expensive—sometimes prohibitively so—and bulky in some cases.  Mhatre envisions that her prototype glove would be produced for around $30 USD, making it more affordable. And because basic smart-phones are ubiquitous worldwide, this approach to braille conversion would be accessible to a larger population.  According to the World Health Organization’s Global Data on Visual Impairments (2010), the estimated number of visually impaired people in the world is 285 million; 39 million are blind and 246 million have low vision.  People who have hearing as well as visual impairments are solely dependent on their tactile senses for their daily needs and for the purpose of communication. The scope of education for such physically challenged people is limited to learning from tactile sign language, print on palm, tactile fingerspelling, braille-embossed books, etc.  Mhatre explains that for blind individuals, searching the internet requires screen reading software that will read out the information on the screen, but this may require a significant amount of time to learn the process. They can also use refreshable braille displays with audio clues to read the content. But people in the deaf-blind community are vision and hearing impaired and cannot use the audio clues to access the web. In addition, many of them cannot afford the expensive braille displays. Thus, they are deprived of knowledge, resources and technologies available to others.  “Apart from reading and communication purposes, Braille Tech will also allow people to learn braille without having to buy braille books, hence it is useful for common people to improve communication with the deaf-blind community which will minimize the gap and increase socialization among them,” she says.  Mhatre, who received her undergraduate education in computer engineering, first became interested in human-computer interaction while working on this project during her studies in India. She and three other female students began working on the Braille Tech design about a year and a half ago. One of her partners remains involved, focusing on the electronics, while Mhatre works on the software side of the project. The pair received valuable feedback about their prototype from the Helen Keller Institute in Mumbai and won a Best Methodology Award at the National Conference for Advanced Engineering Trends in 2016.  Davide Bolchini, chair of the Human-Centered Computing Department and HCI professor says, “Madhura’s project exemplifies the creative human-centered research that our students generate to address issues of high societal relevance, especially in the area of accessible computing. We are proud to see Madhura finding the resources and methods here to further develop her project that she started before coming to IUPUI.”  Listen to the Easter Seals Crossroads podcast featuring Braille Tech  Mhatre plans to work as a user experience researcher after graduating with her master’s degree next year. Studying human-computer interaction has given her a new perspective on product design—one that begins the process with defining the user’s requirements in depth before developing a solution.  Two other School of Informatics and Computing students, Jacob Harris and Cassandra Jones, also participated in this year’s JagStart event.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Applied Data and Information Science B.S. degree approved and open for enrollment  June 4, 2019  The Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI now is offering an undergraduate degree in Applied Data and Information Science (ADIS). The new bachelor’s degree was approved at the May 6 meeting of the Indiana Commission for Higher Education.  Students may pursue two specializations within the ADIS major. The Applied Data Science specialization develops mathematical and technical skills to analyze datasets. The Applied Information Science specialization develops skills to organize, access, and manage datasets. Both specializations include courses on the societal implications of data work. Along with the major, there are several other opportunities for students to engage in a data-focused curriculum, including two minors, two certificates, and two accelerated 4+1 options.  Of the 47 iSchools in North America, only four have bachelor’s degrees in Data Science (University of California at Irvine, Drexel University, University of Washington, and Penn State). The School of Informatics and Computing is the only iSchool to offer data-related programs at bachelors, masters, and Ph.D. levels. Graduate students may pursue a master’s in Applied Data Science or a Ph.D. in Data Science. Many of the courses are offered online.  [iSchools](https://ischools.org/)  The data programs focus on the data lifecycle and data pipeline, and the specific activities and skills that are crucial for working with data. According to DataONE.org , these activities include planning how to manage data and make it accessible, collecting data from various sources, assuring data quality, describing data using metadata tools and standards, preserving data for long-term use, discovering data by locating and obtaining data and metadata, integrating data from multiple sources, and analyzing data by various methods.  [DataONE.org](https://www.dataone.org/)  Angela Murillo, assistant professor of Library and Information Science and Data Science and ADIS program director, who led the development of the ADIS program, said “The Applied Data and Information Science (ADIS) Bachelor of Science degree ensures that students gain skills at every stage of the data pipeline. The program teaches data curation, management, analysis, and dissemination to create actionable insights with data, while also addressing the social and technical implication of data practices. Data skills are essential to navigate a workforce and society that increasingly relies on data (for many types of decision making).”  [Library and Information Science](https://luddy.iupui.edu/lis/)  An understanding of how data is used and managed is among the job skills in highest demand today. Employees in virtually any career field or industry can benefit from this valuable knowledge as data continues to be central to organizational operations at every level.  Interested students may contact the undergraduate program staff or graduate program staff with questions, or visit undergraduate degrees or graduate degrees for more information and to apply.     ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Indiana Workforce Development awards $400K to iDEW program  February 17, 2016  The Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI received a $405,495 Skill Up Indiana grant from Indiana Workforce Development to support its Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce (iDEW) program—a unique initiative that prepares a diverse cross section of Indianapolis high school students for careers in information technology.  Read the IUPUI press release.  “The Skill Up grant will provide significant program support to the iDEW program, which builds an IT talent pipeline in Indiana through innovative project-based learning over the four years of high school,” says Mathew Palakal, executive associate dean at the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, and program director for iDEW.  The program’s “wraparound” approach gives high school students in at-risk populations access to skills workshops, internships, professional certification training, campus and tech company visits, and special events, says Palakal. “Students work on socially relevant, real-world problems by learning and using informatics and computing technology, and through these learning experiences they are introduced to in-demand, lucrative career opportunities,” he says.  The iDEW program tackles two critical problems—a boom in information technology-related jobs that cannot be met by the current workforce, and a lack of representation in this job sector from Hispanic/Latino and African American workers. There were more than 10,000 computer and IT-related job openings in Central Indiana in the last year alone—a 54% increase over the last four years. Labor market data predict that by 2025, there will be more than 50,000 technology job openings in Central Indiana. But at the current rate of post-secondary degree talent in these fields, 45% of those jobs will not be filled by Indiana workers.  The Higher Education Research Institute’s Survey of American Freshmen indicated that Hispanic/Latino and African American interest in information technology is staggeringly low, particularly among females. In an effort to bridge that gap, the iDEW program focuses on high school populations that have higher concentrations of students from these groups. In its pilot years, the iDEW program has been working with students in three Indianapolis high schools—Arsenal Technical, Providence Cristo Rey, and Pike—to increase their interest in and access to careers in technology.  The program is pioneering because it maintains contact and engagement with these students over many years. “Personal interaction with the students over a sustained period of time is the key to making this program a success—repeated reinforcement and enrichment,” Palakal says.  This innovative, targeted approach to workforce issues in Indiana will continue to thrive through the support of outside partners like Indiana Workforce Development; the Interactive Intelligence Foundation; JPMorgan Chase & Co.; the Nina Mason Pulliam Charitable Trust; the Care Institute Group; The Cummins Foundation; the Nicholas H. Noyes, Jr., Memorial Foundation; the RB Annis Educational Foundation; the IU Foundation Women’s Philanthropy Leadership Council; and Old National Bank.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## BioHealth Informatics participants explore evolving health information challenges  May 10, 2021  Two SoIC BioHealth Informatics graduate students and professor of practice Gary Schwebach spoke about the dark side of biometric data; transforming the evolving field of precision medicine; and telemedicine, as presenters at a virtual spring regional conference April 14-15, 2021, for the Kentucky and Indiana chapters of the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society.  Graduate students Gopala Krishna Ganta and Vini Khanuja are earning their master’s degrees in Health Informatics at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI. Gary Schwebach, D.B.A, J.D., is a health informatics professor of practice, and biomedical informatics associate program director at SoIC.   ### You can’t alter your fingerprint – but it can be hacked  If someone manages to access your Netflix password, you change it. But how do we respond when our biometrics are compromised?  In his HIMSS presentation “Provider Identification, Data Integrity, Data Management,” Gopala Ganta examined how biometric data technology, such as fingerprint readers and voice and facial recognition, may allow access to personal data when breached.  A major disadvantage is that biometrics are permanent, he notes – unlike passwords, which can be changed when malicious activity is detected.  “Insights of the threats associated with the digital analogues of once physical and behavioral characteristics (biometrics) would provide a platform for revolutionary and innovative ideas,” says Ganta, “which could help health care organizations develop robust and sound biometric systems.”   ### Personalizing medicine requires the right data  The next step in personalizing medical care lies in coordinating patient data. In her presentation, “Precision Medicine and the Promise of Genomics,” Vini Khanuja examined how efforts to implement genomic medicine in real-world clinical settings are essential to laying the foundation for a personalized medicine transformation.  “Analyzing health data in combination with an individual’s genetics,” she notes, “provides practitioners with new tools to predict disease progression and outcomes for selecting the best treatment strategy.”  Integrating data from clinicians, laboratories, and other sources in new ways through patients’ electronic health records can lead to a higher level of personalized medical care. “There’s increasing hope that these efforts will create the foundation of a continuously learning health care system,” Khanuja says.   ### Telehealth for our times  The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a major increase in telehealth visits, forcing providers and patients to quickly adapt to health care platforms many had never used before.  Schwebach moderated a telemedicine panel discussion that capped off the two-day health care information event. The final keynote presentation, “Telehealth: COVID 19 Lessons and Promising Practices from Community Health Centers,” explored the Indiana Primary Health Care Association’s ongoing access program.  “This panel provided attendees with a real-world example of the successes and barriers of rapidly implementing telehealth measures to provide access to underserved communities in Indiana,” says Schwebach, who is co-director of the BioHealth Informatics Research Center.   ### A virtual, regional event  The Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society is a not-for-profit devoted to improving health care in quality, safety, cost-effectiveness and access through the information technology and management systems. April’s virtual regional conference involved Indiana and Kentucky HIMSS chapters, and drew more than 130 participants.  “This conference brought attention to the School of Informatics and Computing.” Schwebach notes, “and how the quality of its students can bring value to the Indiana health care community as the nature of health care changes in the face of new technologies.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Grant allows SoIC faculty to explore use of open data  February 23, 2022  SoIC faculty Andrea Copeland and Ayoung Yoon have received a $349,084 National Leadership grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services to develop public library services relevant to open data.  [Andrea Copeland](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/andrea-copeland/)  [Ayoung Yoon](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/ayoung-yoon/)  Copeland, an associate professor and Ph.D., is chair and program director of the Department of Library and Information Science at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI. Yoon, Ph.D., is an associate professor with the department.  [School of Informatics and Computing](https://luddy.iupui.edu)  They are co-principal investigators for the open data project, IMLS grant LG-250098-OLS-21 .  [LG-250098-OLS-21](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-250098-ols-21)   ### The public access revolution  Open data allows public access to information about a wide variety of topics, including scientific research, clinical trials, public safety, and school enrollment. This data is freely available online for anyone to use, modify, and share.  [Open data](https://okfn.org)  Media outlets and research centers—as well as international, federal, state, and municipal agencies—maintain open data sites, such as Indiana’s Management Performance Hub .  [Management Performance Hub](https://www.in.gov/mph/)   ### Breaking new ground  Copeland and Yoon are focusing on community open data engagement. “Our effort is unique and the first of its kind in the field of public libraries,” Yoon says.  “More and more public libraries are increasingly participating in the open data movement by providing open data access, public programming, data workforce development, and civic data engagement through partnerships with local data intermediaries.”  This is the second time the research team has been honored with a grant from IMLS. The institute is an independent federal agency that works to support and empower U.S. museums and libraries through grants, research, and policy development.   ### A model for community engagement  Copeland and Yoon will continue work begun under their previous IMLS grant, developing a model for community open data engagement (mCode) focusing on data that is freely available for anyone to utilize and publish.  “The opportunity to continue the work that Dr. Yoon and I started 3 years ago and to include community partners throughout has allowed our research to evolve alongside local data practices, Copeland says. “We are learning as our community partners are, we are truly co-creating new knowledge together.”   ### Building on knowledge  Yoon notes, “This model was developed from our previous research project, by conducting various research activities, including community interviews, libraries interviews, and library patron surveys.”  “Now,” she says, “we want to test and validate the model to seek out generalizability of the model and test the potential scalability.”  The project examines how public libraries enable patrons to work with open data, and the ways they provide services using it. Copeland and Yoon are focusing on how libraries:   ### Working with library systems  “There remain notable gaps between public libraries that are actively participating in open data and those that are not,” Yoon notes, “due to differences in capacity and resources.  “Our project fills this gap by providing resources and recommendations in developing open data services.”  The professors are working with two library systems in Indiana — Indianapolis and Evansville Vanderburgh public libraries — as well as Ann Arbor District Library in Michigan, and Spokane Public Library in Washington.  “We were very excited to have them joined in our project,” Yoon says, “because of their strong interests and passion for developing open data services for their communities.”   ### Details  The Institute of Museum and Library Services is the primary source of federal support for the nation’s libraries and museums, advancing and empowering them through grantmaking, research, and policy development.  [Institute of Museum and Library Services](https://www.imls.gov/)  Copeland, whose research area is public libraries and community engagement, also is Co-PI of the IMLS funded project Data Reuse for Local Communities (LG-96-17-0184-17) investigating community data reuse practice.  Yoon’s research focuses on data curation, data reuse, and open data engagement.

    "body": "  ## Informatics alumnus looks forward to release of his most recent Pixar work “Brave” in theaters Friday  June 19, 2012  When the movie “Brave” opens in theaters nationwide Friday, June 22, IUPUI alumnus Frank Tai will get his second look at the animated family film. His first look at the Disney-Pixar 3-D production came during a private party on his job in California.    “Brave,” set in Scotland, is the tale of the “heroic journey of Merida, a skilled archer and headstrong” princess who learns the true meaning of bravery after she “inadvertently unleashes chaos and fury in the kingdom … forcing Merida to harness all her skills and resources … to undo a beastly curse,” according to movie’s website.  As a sets modeler and dresser in Pixar’s sets department, Tai’s focus has been the movie’s trees and forests. He and his co-workers at Pixar Animation Studios in Emeryville, Calif., about 11.5 miles from San Francisco, saw the completed work — sets, sound, animation — for the first time during the private company party.  “The movie turned out really good,” said Tai, whose mother, Wei Shiuan, happened to be visiting her son and was able to attend the company screening.  Tai is looking forward to seeing the new Pixar movie in a public theater.  “It is a different experience to watch a film with the general public,” said Tai, a native of Taiwan who studied animation at IUPUI. “You get different feedback.”  Tai, who came to the United States specifically to attend the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, chose informatics as a career because it allows him to combine his computer skills and artistic abilities. He has been with Pixar for four years, joining the company after earning both a bachelor’s degree and master’s degree in media arts and science from the School of Informatics and Computing.  “I submitted my resume and demo reel while I was in graduate school in 2008,” Tai said. “After a few phone interviews, I got a phone call from Pixar, and they told me that I was accepted into their 2008 Technical Director Resident program.  “Right after I graduated from school, I packed everything and drove all the way from Indiana to California. I remember I felt I was like entering Charlie’s Chocolate Factory when I first arrived at Pixar.”  Using 3-D computer software for the process he described as “digital sculpting,” Tai mostly worked on the exterior sets in the movie, creating the Scotland forest lands and exteriors of the castle.  Working from the numerous photos and videos taken by the movie’s art directors, producers and supervisors during visits to Scotland, Tai and Pixar’s other sets workers modeled a lot of trees, bushes and vegetation to create a digital set that looks like a forest.  “We tried to make people believe when they are watching the film that they are in Scotland as much as possible,” Tai said.  Tai’s work on his first Pixar assignment, creating sets for “Toy Story 3,” gave him a boost when the time for “Brave” came.  “I was very focused on vegetation modeling and set dressing on ‘Toy Story 3.’ The sets supervisor on ‘Brave’ like my work on ‘Toy Story 3’ and thought I would have a good eye for vegetation set dressing on ‘Brave,’” he said.  “Frank’s work at Pixar is a continuing inspiration to all of the students in the School of Informatics and Computing,” said Albert William, a research associate in Media Arts and Science in the school. “His work ethic combined with his talents helps students understand what it takes to succeed in the industry at a very high level. I continue to show his graduate stereoscopic animation project ‘Paco’ to students, and use it to let them know that they, too, can aspire to these levels of achievement.  “Frank takes time to provide direction and feedback to student portfolios, and we are all very proud to have Frank as an alumnus. I am very happy that Frank has worked on such groundbreaking animations, and I congratulate him on his many successes with Pixar.”  At IUPUI, Tai took all the 3-D computer animation courses offered in the School of Informatics and Computing, learning modeling, shading and lighting, and then how to animate. His graduate school studies and research focused on animation. He advises aspiring animators to focus on computer skills, saying the industry is looking more for people with those skills than artistic people. “We need more computer science people than artistic people. Nowadays 3-D animation films are driven by computer science,” he said.  And since a typical computer-animated film takes about four years to make, the job also requires a great deal of passion, Tai said.  “You really have to be passionate about what you do, because people often feel quite frustrated when they don’t see any results in a short period of time,” Tai said. “Filmmaking, especially computer-animated film, is an extremely slow process, and it (requires) a lot of determination and time.  “I think people have to really enjoy and understand the working process even more than the final results. Also we are working with computer technology every day, so it is very important that you keep up with the techniques.”  Tai is now at work on his third movie with Pixar, a prequel to “Monsters, Inc.” The storyline traces the lives of the movie’s monster characters before they get hired by Monsters, Inc.  “I can’t tell you what the story is about, but the title is already out: ‘Monster University,'” Tai said.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

Plater Civic Engagement Medallion was established in 2006 to honor IUPUI graduates who have excelled in their commitment to the community through activities such as service learning, volunteerism, community/social issue advocacy, community work-study, and political engagement.  Shawn Gwyn, a 2014 graduate of the Media Arts and Science program at the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, was one of 34 recipients of the medallion presented as part of the IUPUI Robert G. Bringle Civic Engagement Showcase and Symposium on April 23 at the IUPUI Campus Center.    His altruistic efforts with Keep Indianapolis Beautiful (KIB), voluntarily cleaning up his neighborhood, and a host of other ways in which he strives to make his community better for everyone earned him the coveted William M. Plater Civic Engagement Medallion.  “Team building and technology class was wonderful. The professor went above and beyond to help students and create a service learning experience with Keep Indianapolis Beautiful (KIB), ” Gwyn said.  Gwyn’s service learning project with KIB consisted of producing a flash game mimicking Whack-a-Mole , to encourage others to get in the act of planting trees. Shawn and his team spent countless hours working on and smoothing out any hiccups until it was perfect and ready to be presented to the client.  “The service learning project with KIB, and some other projects I had the opportunity to work on, totally changed my idea of what games can do, how they can interact with the community, and what we should be doing with games. From those experiences, I also learned a tremendous amount about how to work with others to produce the best possible product.”  Gwyn’s experiences have not only changed the way he looks at games, but also his career ambitions. He now looks to make games that teach, improve the player, and the community around them.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## LIS-S 604 Topics in Library and Information Science  1-4 credits  [schedule](https://sisjee.iu.edu/sisigps-prd/web/igps/course/search/)   ### Description  Study of specific topics in librarianship and preservation. May be repeated for credit when topic varies. Same course number used for different courses.  Topics include:  Family Engagement in Libraries  This course focuses on all aspects of the concept: Family Engagement in Libraries. This topical seminar involves exploration of all aspects of family engagement both for children and young adults ages 0-18, as well as support for their parents, guardians, caregivers and educators. All types of literacies Including but not limited to digital literacy as well as traditional print literacies will be investigated.  Library Leadership  Library leadership develops leaders who lead change in positional and non-positional roles by creating experiences and spaces for participation and belonging to imagine and construct 21st century libraries and decolonial knowledge systems. This course distinguishes leadership from management. It establishes a safe space for critical dialogue that challenges norms and assumptions, systems, and practices that perpetuate injustices. Leadership identity is developed by situating leadership in historical, social organizational and community contexts to identify complex local/global issues that affect libraries and communities to practice leadership through critical dialogue, active listening and coaching. Library Leadership aims to fill a much-needed gap in LIS education and prepare generational leaders to address issues that impact information access and obstruct knowledge justice.  Inquiry and Innovation  This course is an introduction to the use of information inquiry processes, methods, techniques, and concepts with PK-12 students and other educators and librarians. Skills and processes associated with information literacy, media literacy, creative thinking, and critical thinking provide the foundation of the course design. Throughout the course students will be exploring and applying innovative integration of technology into curriculum development and programming. Timely topics such as administrating Learning Management Systems and designing curriculum for eLearning and 1:1 initiatives are included.  Tools for Digital Preservation  Building on the knowledge and skills acquired in LIS-S 582 (Digital Preservation), this course introduces students to practical tools for curating and preserving born-digital objects. Throughout the course, students will test and evaluate primarily free and/or open-source software designed to transfer, appraise (forensically), package, ingest, arrange, describe, and provide access to born-digital records. The course will also familiarize students with how to interact with digital files through a command line interface (shell) as a means for developing more efficient and scalable digital preservation workflows.  Legal Issues for Library and Information Managers  While you will not be able to learn every aspect of the law relating to libraries you will leave the course with a strong foundation to continue learning in these and new areas… we’ll dispel myths, practice how to think as courts, lawyers and “the law” thinks regarding legal issues in the library and how to approach and resolve problems of legal risk management in the library and related settings. This course will also prepare you to be an advocate for a variety of library and patron rights of access to and use of information in all its forms. Legal issues are becoming increasingly important in libraries and other information settings. The litigious nature of our society, the reactive nature of our legislative processes and at times the partisanship of our administrative agencies only exacerbate and complicate the challenges for librarians in navigating sound decision-making in this area. There is more law to understand now than 10 or 20 years ago when this course was first developed and taught; more court cases, statutes and administrative rule of direct relevance to libraries.  The prevalence of digital content requires a thorough understanding of copyright and contract (licensing). In our connected world patron informational privacy remains a bulwark of the librarian profession and its practice.  The Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment continues to drive our law and policy making in libraries, from access issues (meeting rooms, display cases, presence in the library, liberty interests, etc.) to content regulation (in-house and online collections) to information liability and malpractice for what some may call dangerous information, disinformation (“fake news”) or outdated information including information execution errors.  These concepts are explored in detail throughout the course, increasing the repertoire of tools with which the graduating librarian can enter practice.  Global Digital Services  This is a course for Study Abroad: Finland . This experience is comprised of two learning components. The first is a semester-long course taken by local students alongside others from Finland for a global classroom experience (graduate: LIS S531, undergraduate: INFO I400), and those traveling abroad will take an additional 3 credits starting in spring but terminating during summer session 1. LIS S604/S400 will offer students the opportunity to collaborate with students at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences in Helsinki, Finland. This course will begin in the spring semester and continue at our cooperating institution during summer I. In the spring semester, students from the IUPUI campus will be partnered with students from the Haaga-Helia campus and follow the course together via Canvas and other tools. The online course in the spring will provide technological and conceptual knowledge in skills such as HTML, CSS, and information architecture that will be practiced and refined in collaborative course projects. For Indiana University students who wish to go abroad, part of spring semester will also be devoted to academic sessions in anticipation of the international travel. All projects will be finalized at the end of spring semester but with the option to further collaborate with their partners. In the first half of summer session 1, students will have the opportunity to reconvene in Helsinki to discuss and pursue their projects with their collaborators at Haaga-Helia University. In Finland (not limited to Helsinki) the students’ activities will be supplemented by field trips and site visits relevant to the class as well as to Finnish culture in general via visits to historic sites, museums, industries, and cultural events. Our partner institution is Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences in Helsinki, Finland. However, we will not need to use classroom facilities at the University, although that is an option. Most lectures will have been accomplished before arrival. On-site activities include meetings, class visits, and lectures.  [Study Abroad: Finland](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/study-abroad/finland.html)  [Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences](https://www.haaga-helia.fi/en)  History and Methods of the Islamic Book  The history of books is the history of the world and in no field is that more true than the history of the Islamic book. This course will be an overview of the history of Islamic Manuscripts, preparing students to encounter Islamic manuscripts as LIS/GLAM professionals: Thus, this course will adopt a broad understanding of the term ‘Islamic’ to give students an inclusive, diverse view of the world of books in Muslim-majority lands (as well as their diasporas). The approach we take centers accessibility and reparative approaches so get ready to ask hard questions of the institutions we’re studying. Each week will introduce students to different aspects of the materiality of the book and issues around cataloging, artistry, digitization, rare book libraries, and museums. Students will be introduced to each material component of the Islamic manuscript, as well as its history. This course is global in its approach, introducing students to manuscripts from West Africa to Southeast Asia, spanning the 500s to the 1800s. Additionally, while students will learn basic handling principles and some aspects of conservation, this course will center the use of digital archives. Digital open-access archives for Islamic manuscripts, including digital library repositories, museum catalogs, and more, will be a constant in the course on a week-to-week basis.  Students will engage in critical analysis of archive accessibility including but not limited to user interface (UI)/user experience (UX) and the viability of digitization as an accessibility solution.  The course will prepare students to catalog and describe Islamic manuscripts, do research on Islamic manuscripts and give them a grounding in what Islamic manuscript collections exist globally and digitally. Students will read 60-100 pages a week and will write weekly response papers of 500-750 words on accessibility of the archives under consideration for that week. Students are also responsible for watching the weekly lecture. Knowledge of Arabic or any other non-European language is useful but not required. Non-DLIS students are also encouraged to enroll.  Social Issues in Archives  This course will introduce students to social, cultural, and critical theory in archival practice through scholarly literature, case studies, and the lived experiences of course participants. Students will consider how sociocultural factors such as race and ethnicity, indigeneity, gender, sexuality, class, citizenship status, and language manifest in the archival record. The course will also discuss the explicit, normative, and emerging obligations of archivists in relation to these elements and explore the outcomes of specific programs and practices. Drawing from the pedagogy of bell hooks and Paola Freire, students are expected to participate with active curiosity in critical dialogue. Drawing upon shared course readings, independent research, personal reflections, and lived experience, we will collectively respond to a series of “wicked problems” in archival practice. By the end of the course, students will demonstrate an understanding of archival practice through cross-disciplinary frameworks of sociocultural critique.   ### Program Learning Goals Supported  Instructors map their courses to specific LIS Program Goals .

    "body": "  ## School of Informatics and Computing and STARS Alliance Students Create a College Visit to Remember for Local High School Students  October 18, 2012  School of Informatics and Computing faculty, staff and students recently collaborated to provide an engaging, hands-on learning experience for freshmen and sophomores from Indianapolis’ Providence Cristo Rey High School on October 2. The event served as an introduction for the high school students to the study of informatics and computing, as well as the school’s undergraduate programs and scholarship opportunities in Media Arts and Science, Informatics and Health Information Administration.    Students were treated to IUPUI’s Advanced Visualization Lab, where professor Dr. Davide Bolchini and doctoral student Debaleena Chattopadhyay presented their research in the field of Human-Computer Interaction. Students were able to interact with the lab’s high resolution display wall, demonstrating motion tracking and gesture recognition, and a tilting touch table display.  Current School of Informatics and Computing students, including many members of the STARS Alliance, were integrally involved in planning an enriching experience for the high school students. Activities included a student-run GameMaker video game workshop and tours of both the IUPUI campus and UITS facilities. All Providence Cristo Rey High School students walked away from the visit with their own video game to play with family and friends. School of Informatics and Computing students involved included Sarah Parker, Eric Padget, Brittany Conway, Mary McClung, Matt Misner and Brittney Parker.  The STARS Alliance (Students and Technology in Academia, Research and Service) is a national organization whose mission is to increase the participation of women, under-represented minorities, and persons with disabilities in computing degree programs and careers. The School of Informatics and Computing has been vital in establishing a STARS presence at IUPUI and developing student leaders in computing and technology.  Located minutes from downtown Indianapolis, Providence Cristo Rey is a private, college-preparatory high school for students from families with limited financial means. The high school combines rigorous classroom instruction with real-life work and study experiences for students. Many Providence Cristo Rey students take dual credit classes at IUPUI and Indiana University Health is one of the high school’s corporate work study partners.  The students, faculty and staff of the School of Informatics and Computing look forward to additional opportunities to work with high schools, teachers and students like those from Providence Cristo Rey. If interested in arranging a visit for yourself, your students or your club, please contact Vicki Daugherty, project coordinator for the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, at vdaugher@iupui.edu or 317-278-4123.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Microsoft Research Chief will Keynote School of Informatics and Computing Inauguration Ceremonies  September 27, 2013  Ceremonies inaugurating the launch of IU’s newly merged School of Informatics and School of Library and Information Science will be highlighted by comments from Microsoft Corporate Vice President Peter Lee, head of Microsoft Research — an organization encompassing more than 1,100 scientists and engineers across 13 labs worldwide.  Lee will speak at 3 p.m. Friday, Sept. 27, at IU Bloomington’s Whittenberger Auditorium as the guest of IU President Michael A. McRobbie and IU School of Informatics and Computing Dean Bobby Schnabel. A live ceremony will take place the same day at the IUPUI campus and will feature IU Health President and CEO Daniel F. Evans Jr.  A live stream of the IU Bloomington ceremony and Lee’s comments will be offered at the IUPUI event, taking place at the Informatics and Communications Technology Complex Auditorium.  “Peter Lee is one of the foremost leaders and visionaries in the computer science community and draws on extensive experience from a distinguished academic career, government service and now as the leader of Microsoft Research,” Schnabel said. “I am delighted that the IU community and our friends will have the opportunity to hear him discuss his vision for the future of computing.”  Lee joined Microsoft in 2008 as distinguished scientist and managing director of the Microsoft Research Redmond Lab. He later took on leadership of Microsoft’s U.S.-based research operations, comprising seven laboratories and over 500 researchers, engineers and support personnel.  Before joining Microsoft, Lee held key positions in both government and academia. His most recent position was at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, where he founded and directed a major technology office that supported research in computing and related areas in the social and physical sciences. Before DARPA, Lee served as head of Carnegie Mellon University’s nationally top-ranked computer science department.  The live event at IUPUI, according to Executive Associate Dean Mathew J. Palakal, will provide guests an opportunity to hear Evans talk about the intertwined relationship between technology and health care.  “Indiana is ranked as one of the five states leading the nation in the health and life sciences, and IU Health is a cornerstone of Indiana’s position,” Palakal said. “As the president and CEO of IU Health, Dan Evans is providing the vision and direction that Indiana needs to lead the way in health care innovation. Informatics and information technology play an important role in the transformation of health care delivery. We are pleased to have Dan Evans here to share his insight about the evolution of informatics in health care.”  The two schools officially merged July 1, creating the School of Informatics and Computing on both campuses and offering the expanded breadth, size and quality designed to address the rapid expansion of informatics, computing and libraries.  Before the merger, the School of Library and Information Science was consistently among the top 10 (eighth in the 2013 rankings) in the U.S. News and World Report rankings. An outside analysis of information and library science journals found IU second, behind Harvard University, in the impact of its publications.  The School of Informatics, the first of its kind in the country, was founded as a school in 2000 and introduced the nation’s first Ph.D. in informatics; IU’s longstanding Computer Science Department joined the school in Bloomington in 2005. The school is an international research leader in areas including bioinformatics, complex networks and systems, cyber-infrastructure, data and search, human-computer interaction, networks and systems, programming languages, social informatics, and security and privacy.

Thomas Lewis . Lewis, a lecturer in the Media Arts and Science (MAS) program at the Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, shot the narrative film in Kenya during the summer of 2015 as part of a series of four films.  [Heartland Film Festival](http://heartlandfilm.org/festival/)  [C. Thomas Lewis](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/thomas-lewis/)  Each film focuses on a Kenyan adolescent struggling with the social stigma of HIV. In Michael , a young boy suffers harsh treatment at home and is faced with caring for his own health.  Funded by a New Frontiers in Arts and Humanities grant from Indiana University, and the IUPUI Arts and Humanities Institute, Lewis and the film’s co-producer—anthropologist Dr. Jeanette Dickerson-Putman from the IU School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI—partnered with Dr. Rachel Vreeman, director of research for the IU Center of Global Health at the IU School of Medicine.  With the help of students at Moi University in Kenya, and Christopher Odhiambo—head of the Department of Theater and Film Studies at Moi—Lewis and Dickerson-Putman developed film scripts focusing on HIV-infected adolescents who are dealing with the HIV stigma. After the completion of shooting in July 2015, MAS program students played an integral part of the post-production on all four films.  The film series will be used by AMPATH (Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare), which is based in Eldoret, Kenya. It will be used to raise community understanding about stigma and to counsel those infected with HIV throughout the Kenyan community. AMPATH is a partnership between Moi University, Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital, and a consortium of North American academic health centers led by Indiana University.  Michael will be screened on Friday, October 21 at 7:30 p.m. at the AMC Castleton Square 14 and again on Wednesday, October 26 at 7:45 p.m. at AMC Showplace Traders Point 12.

The project will ultimately work toward the advancement of automatic knowledge acquisition from unstructured data – an area of growth and increased focus for Allegient.  Significant growth of the country’s senior population is expected to challenge the capacity of this segment of the U.S. health system in the near future. Concurrently, alternative strategies to support seniors living independently will be critical in controlling these demands on the system as well as the enormous cost-pressure realized by increasing numbers of seniors requiring care.  “The School of Informatics and Computing’ text mining laboratory will add key research to the development of the automated knowledge acquisition system,” said Mathew Palakal, Ph.D., and associate dean for graduate studies and research. “This technology will mine large, text-based literature databases, giving senior care facilities and providers access to the most current geriatric health research — information that could dramatically influence care decisions made by seniors and their families.”  “This automated knowledge technology directly addresses the challenges of senior care by helping geriatric care managers and other health professionals provide the best caregiving advice,” said Eric Tinsley, the project’s principle investigator and vice president of service delivery for Allegient. “This technology dramatically improves the efficiency, completeness, consistency, and quality of the knowledge available for care planning.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Copeland is co-editor for ‘Participatory Heritage’  March 24, 2017  How can heritage institutions work with their communities to build broader, more inclusive, and culturally relevant collections? Professor Andrea Copeland is co-editor for Participatory Heritage , a new volume of selected international case studies that addresses the question.  Copeland, associate professor in the Department of Library and Information Science at the Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, worked with co-editor Henriette Roued-Cunliffe—assistant professor at the Royal School of Library and Information Science, University of Copenhagen, Denmark—to explore research that looks at new challenges for cultural heritage institutions that are brought about by social media as a platform for facilitating human organization.  “Participatory heritage could be thought of as a space in which individuals engage in cultural activities outside of formal institutions for the purpose of knowledge sharing and co-creating with others,” says Copeland. “The collaborations are ‘bottom-up’ in nature, as they emerge from connections among individuals rather than organizations.” ​  Copeland says increased engagement with heritage by local and family historians, craftspeople, artists, and others could expand the archival universe and create a more inclusive past. However, without links to formal heritage institutions, issues of scalability, as well as long-term and equitable access, arise. “Ideally, the participatory heritage space will evolve to include methods for community-based groups to partner with cultural institutions to the benefit of both,” Copeland says.  Participatory Heritage offers insights for heritage professionals on how to build links from community groups back to their institutions, using methods that are inclusive in their recognition of shared expertise. Managing copyright, ownership, orphan works, open data access to heritage representations and artifacts, crowdsourcing, and sustainable preservation are among the issues covered.  Professor Henriette Roued-Cunliffe teaches and researches heritage data and information, in particular how DIY culture is engaging with cultural heritage online and often outside of institutions.  Professor Copeland’s research focus is public libraries and their relationship with communities, with a current emphasis on connecting the cultural outputs of individuals and community groups to a sustainable preservation infrastructure.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Mikaylah Gross and Hannah Roper Donor Highlight  December 10, 2018  Mikaylah Gross (BS Informatics ‘16 and MS Human Computer Interaction ’18) and Hannah Roper (BS Informatics ‘18) are recent IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI (SoIC) graduates already making a difference by giving back to their School.  They have stepped up together to establish the Make Your Mark Scholarship to benefit current SoIC students who are making a positive difference in the world using technology. For Mikaylah and Hannah, this scholarship is both the fulfillment of a long-time goal and a way to honor their time at SoIC.  When considering what attracted them to SoIC early in their college careers, both Mikaylah and Hannah used the same word: Community .  Remembering her early search for a major at IUPUI, Mikaylah said, “I felt frustrated in my previous degree program, like I was wasting my money while not finding exactly what I was looking for. Then, I ran into Vicki Daugherty , who knew me from a previous award I won in high school. She mentioned that I should try out SoIC, which prompted me to sample a few class offerings. Right away, I knew that this school was a much better fit for me. There is a sense of community within SoIC, because everybody feels like family and is supportive of each other’s goals and aspirations. I loved that SoIC made my degree feel unique and customizable.”  [Vicki Daugherty](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/vicki-daugherty/)  Hannah agreed, stating “I owe so much of who I am today to SoIC and specifically to Vicki Daugherty.  As I was deciding between IUB and IUPUI, I met with her to talk about the campus and SoIC overall. In that two-hour meeting, she showed me the community and family-like atmosphere that SoIC had cultivated. SoIC and the Informatics degree was the perfect fit for me because I could still be true to who I am while helping others find their passions in tech.”  Vicki Daugherty, SoIC diversity coordinator said “In my role, I have had the privilege to work with many great SoIC students over the years and I have seen Mikaylah and Hannah foster a sense of belonging in others while instilling confidence in them as well as the desire to pursue careers in technology.  These dedicated women have also set the bar for near-peer mentoring activities as part of the Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce (iDEW) program in Indianapolis area high schools.  I was overwhelmed about their establishment of the Make Your Mark Scholarship as young professionals just starting their careers.  But I am not surprised, as this generosity reflects who they are as people.”  [Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce](https://luddy.iupui.edu/idew/)  SoIC provided many opportunities for Mikaylah and Hannah that went beyond what they considered the typical college experience. Hannah remembers, “Mikaylah and I met each other through STARS Computing Corps, and we became the type of friends who push each other to pursue their life-long dreams and go in search of what makes you happy, aka best friends.” Mikaylah was able to check a number of items off what she calls her “mental bucket list” as she completed her career at SoIC, including traveling the world, leading women in tech organizations, and teaching several classes and workshops.  But there was one particular item on the list to which she kept returning. “I kept saying to myself that I wanted to start a scholarship, but it wasn’t a wise decision financially for what I could afford at the time, so I chose to focus on finishing my education. The minute I graduated, I reflected back on the list in my mind and thought, ‘Oh, I still haven’t accomplished this’. I actually reached out to Hannah and said, ‘I have this idea. I really want to start a scholarship, and you’re going to have to tell me if that sounds crazy or not.’ Right away, she stated ‘no it’s not, because I’ll do it with you.’”  In determining the requirements for their scholarship, it was important to Mikaylah and Hannah to make as many SoIC students eligible as possible, while ensuring that the recipient demonstrated passion in the field of informatics and computing. “It’s open to any student who is intrinsically motivated to make a difference in the field of technology, whether it be in the industry, academia, or through service leadership.” Mikaylah continued, “We’ve seen shining examples of these students at our school already, so we would like to recognize and support them with hopes that they will continue pursuing their passions and inspiring future generations of technology leaders. Any sophomore, junior or senior from or outside of Indiana may qualify. In addition, there is no minimum GPA requirement, because I believe that GPA doesn’t truly represent the talent, passion, and drive that someone might have towards technology; rather I think it’s the engagement, involvement, and impact that shows a more accurate reflection of a student’s efforts to learn and grow.  As long as the student is in good academic standing, they will have an opportunity for this scholarship.” They decided to call it the Make Your Mark Scholarship because, as Hannah explains, “We are always striving to make our mark wherever we go and whoever we encounter because the world needs more change makers. No matter how small the action, anything can be that catalyst for positive change.”  Mikaylah and Hannah hope that their scholarship can help as many students as possible while inspiring others to give back in whatever way they can. “I’m hoping that in the near future, we can either make this a recurring scholarship to support students for up to three years, or provide more scholarships to expand to even more students,” Mikaylah said. If you would like to learn how to contribute to the Make Your Mark Scholarship , or if you would like to contribute to SoIC in another way, please contact SoIC’s Director of Development Stacy Zearing at szearing@iupui.edu .   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

Sikharam’s presentation “ LifesavAR, an augmented reality triage tag ,” proposes a technology-enabled improvement to traditional paper triage tags used by medical responders at the scene of a mass casualty incident. Personnel would be able to communicate a patient status in real-time to hospitals before transporting, allowing preparations to be made in advance of arrival.  [LifesavAR, an augmented reality triage tag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvccpjKnAn0&feature=youtu.be)  Davide Bolchini, chair of the Human-Centered Computing department, said, “We’re proud of Abhinav’s achievements in designing and showcasing new HCI solutions to the important mission-critical tasks of medical emergency responders. He has shown in exemplary ways how our students are educated to blend information technology, experience design, and business acumen to explore impactful and innovative ideas.”  Sikharam also joined a long line of past School of Informatics and Computing participants and winners of Jagstart, with his innovation, “Project Ma.” Project Ma is a smart desk device paired with an interactive mobile application which nudges the user to stay active, hydrated, and focused during their day while working at their desks. It’s a product designed to improve lifestyle of desk-bound workers, who usually have a sedentary lifestyle.​  “As an HCI designer, I know how to design the products using the design process but wasn’t sure of the entrepreneurial way to launch or what decisions or parameters would go to launch a business. Fortunately, I learned that IUPUI is encouraging students to learn and launch their ideas into reality through Jagstart competition and that is why I got involved,” Sikharam said.  To prepare for the Pitch, participants were guided through weekly webinars on topics ranging from Design Thinking to Creating a Business Model. They were also matched with mentors—experienced professionals working in the industry—to create and refine their presentations. Sikharam was matched with Bob Flynn, CEO of Deflecto, based in Indianapolis. Of course, last year presented an additional challenge to the students and mentors.  “The most challenging part that I faced was the transition of the sessions and one-on-one meetings with mentors from in-class to completely online with the COVID pandemic. The competition also had to move to online mode and we weren’t sure of how were we going to present our pitches and collaborating was a little tricky in the beginning, but ultimately we got adjusted and we were able to pull off with the competition as planned,” Sikharam said.  After graduation, Sikharam plan to continue to design innovative products that can benefit people in their day-to-day lives and improve their living standards. Sikharam’s advice to others considering Jagstart is that Jagstart is not just a competition, but also a journey to learn entrepreneurial skills. “Even if you don’t have any business idea or have questions such as where to start or how would I proceed? Don’t worry, just take the first step to join the competition. Professors, organizers, and mentors are always available to guide you to level up your business skills and make the next big thing a reality,” he said.

    "body": "  ## Informatics student at IUPUI helps develop app to be used to forecast flu outbreaks  February 13, 2015  A bioinformatics master’s student in the Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI helped develop a mobile app that one day may be used to forecast outbreaks of seasonal flu and other illnesses.  Sandeep Shantaram (pictured second from the right) and other student researchers developed the prototype application as interns at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory for the Biosurveillance Mobile App Development Intern Competition, an annual challenge sponsored by the laboratory and the U.S. Department of Defense. The competition was funded by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency.  The mobile app, called FluCast, won the competition and is now undergoing testing and development through the Defense Threat Reduction Agency’s Biosurveillance Ecosystem program.  The competition focused on exploring solutions to biosurveillance challenges, demonstrating how mobile devices enable access to health care information and resources, making them an ideal option for addressing the needs of digital disease detection.  “FluCast focuses on risk assessment and seasonal flu forecasting using historic flu case information in correlation with weather data and social media to provide a real-time flu risk assessment,” Shantaram said. A collaboration platform for analytics and an RSS feed of flu-related news and Twitter mentions are other features of FluCast.  “The FluCast app can be used to keep track of what is happening in the biological world, monitor it and draw attention to areas where there might be anticipated issues,” Shantaram said. “The app would provide the ability to capture data like geographic location, track any noticeable issues of concern and provide the information such that protocols could be communicated and implemented to reduce the risk of epidemics or outbreaks, like that experienced with the Ebola outbreak.”  About Pacific Northwest National Laboratory  Interdisciplinary teams at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory address many of America’s most pressing issues in energy, the environment and national security through advances in basic and applied science.

    "body": "  ## Donor Highlight: Ashley Vukovits  January 24, 2020  Ashley Vukovits has accomplished a great deal in the burgeoning Indianapolis technology scene. She joined Interactive Intelligence as Vice President of Finance in 2003, when it was, as Vukovits describes it, “the David of tech companies competing against Goliath companies like Cisco, Avaya and Genesys. I liked the thought of working for the underdog.” As the company grew and Indianapolis became a technology hub, Vukovits oversaw a global accounting team of over 70 people and familiarized herself with the world of technology, an industry with which she was unfamiliar prior to joining Interactive Intelligence. She was appointed CFO of Interactive Intelligence in 2015, and her role expanded to include, as she says, “not only accounting/finance, but also human resources, information technology, information systems, facilities and security.” At the end of 2016, Interactive Intelligence closed a transaction to be acquired by Genesys for $1.4 billion. During her tenure at Interactive Intelligence, she was a Women of Influence Honoree in 2015 and a Leading Light Leadership award nominee in 2015. She now serves as a consulting CFO at Sharpen Technologies, another small tech company that is experiencing rapid growth.  Vukovits was instrumental in the early days of the SoIC’s Informatics Diversity-Enchanced Workforce (iDEW) program, where she was a member of the advisory board. iDEW is a high school program that brings exciting information technology classes to Indianapolis-area schools, creating a pathway to college and careers in IT for underrepresented minority and underprivileged students. In 2017, Ashley and her husband Frank established the Vukovits iDEW Scholarship, which provides financial aid to iDEW students studying at IUPUI. She spoke to us about the scholarship and her experience with the iDEW program.  Vukovits’ early philanthropic experience helped influence her decision to become involved with iDEW. As she remembers, “My first non-profit that I got involved with was Art for a Heart.  They offer art classes at school to at-risk youth.  I served on the Board but also went into the classrooms to volunteer.  That experience really was an eye opener to me on how important it is to spend time and money on the at-risk youth in our community; with a little attention and a little resources, these kids thrived.  So when Alvin Givens, a business associate and since then friend, asked if I would be interested in serving on the Advisory Board of iDEW, it was a perfect fit.  iDEW definitely checked the box of helping at-risk youth, but it also addressed my growing interest in technology.  In addition, another need I became aware of as I started at Interactive was the lack of diversity in technology.  Particularly missing were females, blacks and Hispanics.  I love that iDEW focuses on computer science in inter city schools where we can tap into the diversity found in those schools.”  Vukovits’ involvement with the iDEW program coincided with the sale of Interactive Intelligence, and this time of professional change helped to influence her decision to establish the Vukovits iDEW Scholarship. “After the sale of Interactive Intelligence to Genesys, I left to explore other opportunities.  One of the areas I wanted to focus on was how to continue making a difference in helping to diversity the Indiana technology talent pool.  By establishing the Vukovits iDEW Scholarship, my husband and I hope that we can make a difference in helping minority students pursue computer science in college.” Vukovits believes that a diversified technology workforce not only benefits the workers themselves, but positively impacts the field as a whole. “Today when software is created,  most of the time an Agile methodology is used, where there is much more collaboration between developers than there ever has been in the past.  If all the people contributing to that team look the same and come from the same background, they may not create a well-rounded product for all users.  In addition, I believe all kids should have an opportunity to pursue computer sciences if they have an interest.  CS requires a different way of thinking and problem-solving.  Every kid that has those skills will be so marketable to companies.”  Ashley believes philanthropy can be a powerful force for good. “I think it is important that we give back to our community.  Whether you can do that through volunteering or giving money, all means are critical.  It is important to pick a cause that is meaningful to you because then you become passionate about it.  Whether that is the elderly, the military, youth or animals, if we all help out it will only make the world a better place.” If you are interested in learning how to contribute to this scholarship, or if you would like to contribute to SoIC in another way, please contact SoIC’s director of development Stacy Zearing at szearing@iupui.edu.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Informatics alum’s animated short named an official selection of Heartland Film Festival  September 26, 2011  For School of Informatics and Computing alum Greg Oppman, animation is a way to bring his vision to life. And now Heartland Truly Moving Pictures will help him share his vision directly to the public as part of their annual film festival October 13-22.  Oppman’s animated short, Girlie Jar , was recently named an official selection by the Heartland Film Festival. Girlie Jar is one of only six animated shorts selected by the festival for screening this year. Overall, the festival accepted 118 full-length films and shorts from more than 850 submissions.  Oppman, a 2011 graduate of the Media Arts and Science program at the School of Informatics and Computing and a 2007 graduate of Zionsville High School, began creating Girlie Jar in May of 2010 as part of his senior capstone project.  Using the 3D graphics, animation and digital storytelling skills he developed as a media arts and science student, Girlie Jar tells the story of an army veteran father struggling to open a jar, only to find unexpected strength from his young daughter.  It’s an original concept and story that Oppman plays to comedic effect with his use of animation. “I could have told this story using live action and saved a lot of time. But the advantage of using computer animation was that I could exaggerate both the characters’ proportions and the storyline to give an unexpected twist to a familiar situation.”  Girlie Jar ’s light-hearted touch fits well with Heartland’s mission to promote positive change in people’s lives through the transformative power of film, and bodes well for continued increased support of animated filmmaking from the festival.  “Many of the animated shorts are lighter as opposed to our heavier message [live-action] films, which provides comic relief to our patrons,” says Ray Mills, Heartland Film Festival artistic director. “I’m really excited about the future of animation at the Heartland Film Festival. We have not emphasized it in the past, but I’m hoping to change that as we go forward.”  Girlie Jar will be screened on October 15 at 3:35 p.m. and October 18 at 4:00 p.m. at AMC Castleton Square, and also on October 19 at 3:45 p.m. and October 22 at 6:45 p.m. at AMC Showplace 17 on South Meridian.  Started in 1992, Heartland Film Festival attracts thousands of visitors to enjoy independent films and special events. The festival awards more than $100,000 in cash prizes.

D. student in the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, recently received special recognition for her work at the 2014 Indiana Celebration of Women in Computing (InWIC).  Rebecca J. Finch’s lightening talk “Investigating Immersion in Games” won the award for the Best Graduate Lighting Talk at the annual technology conference.  The lightening talk competition required participants to create and deliver five minute mini-presentations showcasing their work or insight they may have acquired either from a class or research project. The presentations could have covered topics such as how to survive a computing major, programming tips, ideas on how to create a successful women in computing group, and various other issues or subject matter.  Finch’s research for her talk involved the Return of Aetheria augmented reality game that was created by Media Arts and Science faculty and students and debuted at GenCon in 2013. She and her investigative team interviewed players at different stages of the game so that they could get an understanding of how players were responding to the different elem ents.  “It was very interesting to see how players interacted or reacted to the various types of quests in the game and to learn what their preferences were,” she said. “It was difficult to summarize in five minutes all that I had learned, but I was up to the challenge!” she added.  The goal of the Indiana Celebration of Women in Computing (InWIC) conference is to provide a low cost, regionally tailored, small conference for women in computing. InWIC is a more intimate version of the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, and shares the same philosophy, supportive environment, and goals.  The InWIC conference is open to people in industry and academic institutions in Indiana and surrounding states.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Collaboration Leads to Cover Feature of Industry Publication  August 13, 2014  The School of Informatics and Computing (SOIC) at IUPUI boasts about its location and ability to provide real-world experience through collaboration. Lecturer Albert William, in the Media Arts and Science (MAS) program, is helping to reinforce that message.    William, a professor for 3D classes in the school, was recently involved in a project with chemists at the IU Bloomington campus, where he assisted with the visualization for the paper “Anion-Induced Dimerization of 5-fold Symmetric Cynostars in 3D Crystalline Solids and 2D Self-Assembled Crystals”. Written by Amar Flood, James F. Jackson, associate professor of chemistry, and Steven L. Tait, assistant professor of chemistry, the paper details their research in demonstrating the self-assembly of a five-sided, symmetrical molecule, called cynostar, that was developed by Flood’s IU research team.  William, who specializes in using advanced graphics and animation to convey complex scientific concepts, was able to create an image depicting the cynostar molecules moving in solution, ordering on the surface, and stacking by anion binding. He used software such as MeshLab and Autodesk Maya to convert the raw data and render the image.  “Creating images such as this was the reason I pursued Informatics and New Media from the beginning,” said William. “It has always been my desire to bridge the gap between the artist and the scientist and make images that are visually appealing while being scientifically relevant. To be able to depict molecular processes that cannot actually be seen is a very powerful educational tool.”  The paper was published online by Chemical Communications, a journal of the Royal Society of Chemistry and William’s artwork, as well as the article, is featured on the cover. The artwork is also visible on the National Science Foundation website at nsf.gov.         ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Alumna to lead new center at Indianapolis Central Library  January 12, 2017  Nichelle M. Hayes, MLS, 2011, was recently appointed to lead the new Center for Black Literature and Culture at the Indianapolis Public Library’s (IndyPL) Central Library in Indianapolis.  [Center for Black Literature and Culture](https://www.indypl.org/locations/central-library/center-for-black-literature-and-culture)  Hayes received her library degree from the IU School of Library and Information Science at IUPUI—now the Department of Library and Information Science (LIS) within the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI.  [Department of Library and Information Science (LIS)](https://luddy.iupui.edu/lis/)  The Center for African-American Literature, located in the R.B. Annis Reading Room, is funded by Lilly Endowment Inc. and will open in October 2017. As program specialist, Hayes will be combining an initial collection of 10,000 volumes with interactive programming—creating a place to study and explore the contributions of Black authors.  She hopes to bring together members of the community to recognize and encourage these accomplishments. “I’m very excited to have the opportunity to make this center the best of its kind in the nation,” said Hayes.  Hayes credits Jean Preer , one of her favorite professors, with inspiring her LIS studies. “Dr. Preer was able to give incredible insight into librarianship and the unsung heroes and ‘sheroes’ who have shaped the profession,” Hayes says.  [Jean Preer](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/jean-preer/)  After graduating from IUPUI, Hayes was a library media-specialist in a K-5 school on the eastside, where she updated and electronically cataloged their book collection. In 2015, she began at IndyPL as a training librarian, and then became business librarian at Central Library, helping patrons with marketing strategies and business plans.  Hayes is a member of the Library’s African-American History Committee, treasurer of the Indiana Black Librarians Network, and member of the NAACP. Previously she was president of the Indiana African American Geneology Group. Hayes is also an alumna of the Indiana Librarians Leading Diversity Fellowship Program.     ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

Through their synthesis of the course readings, students will connect these big ideas to the design and use of seminal ‘historic’ and contemporary social and computing technologies.  Over the course of the semester, students will also carry out research in collaborative and social computing. They will conduct a genealogical literature review about a social science theory of relevance to collaborative and social computing; analyze the ways in which that theory has and has not been applied to the design and analysis of collaborative and social computing systems; construct a design space based on their findings; and produce a series of conceptual design proposals to address either a gap in the design space and/or to flesh out a sweet spot in that space.

    "body": "  ## School of Informatics and Computing faculty receive National Science Foundation grant to develop educational, sound-based STEM games for blind and visually-impaired students  August 22, 2011  The National Science Foundation has awarded School of Informatics and Computing’ faculty approximately $250,000 to further their research and development of multiple online, sound-based educational games and reference materials for blind and visually-impaired K-12 students.  These unique educational resources will utilize audemes – short but complex, mnemonic collages of sound effects and music that do not rely upon traditional speech. Audemes are found to significantly enhance students’ ability to imprint and recall academic information, and have particular utility among populations unable to visually process information. The project will expand understanding of how audemes can enhance concept creation as well as recall, and how non-verbal sound in general correlates to language-based comprehension of concepts.  The games and supplemental digital materials will be specifically designed to support and enhance education in the areas of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). The National Center for Blind Youth in Science, a component of the National Federation of the Blind, notes that blind and visually-impaired students have historically received inadequate education in math and science, creating a barrier that discourages many such students from pursuing STEM careers as adults.  The two-year project is led by School of Informatics and Computing’ Professor Steve Mannheimer as principal investigator, with the school’s Mathew Palakal, associate dean for graduate studies and research, and Davide Bolchini, assistant professor, as co-principal investigators. The team is also supported by the School of Education’s Joshua Smith, director of the Center for Urban and Multicultural Education. The project builds upon nearly four years of previous research and evaluation with students at the Indiana School for the Blind and Visually-Impaired. That work was initially funded by a grant from the Nina Mason Pulliam Charitable Trust. The project was further supported by a one-year Google Research Award received in 2010.  The Indiana School for the Blind and Visually-Impaired will continue to serve as a partner in the testing and evaluation of the research.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Students complete Design Sprint sponsored by School of Informatics and Computing  January 3, 2022  Nearly 40 students combined their expertise to arrive at solutions to the 2021 Design Sprint challenge. Using design thinking principles and practices, teams were asked to conceptualize the 21st century neighborhood from identifying characteristics of success to addressing the difficult problems that some face. The overarching question was how any contributing factors—such as tangible, physical elements, service delivery, social interactions and enhancing technologies—could be re-conceptualized, applied, focused, or expanded to make neighborhoods better.  The sprint ran two weeks, from October 29 through November 15 and was sponsored by the Department of Human-Centered Computing and led by Media Arts and Science professor Steven Mannheimer . Indianapolis Deputy Mayor Judith Thomas (pictured above) visited the group on November 3 to offer some general expertise and plant some conceptual seeds for big-picture goals. Working in teams of four or five undergraduate and graduate students, winning teams arrived at and presented solutions to Kevin Armstrong, Executive VP and Chief of Staff at IU Health, and Professor Mannheimer.  [Steven Mannheimer](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/steve-mannheimer/)   ### Winning teams and their projects   #### FIRST PLACE ($700): Learn from Your Neighbors  The goal: To build a strong network within a community by leveraging knowledge or skill-set sharing sessions  This was an online neighborhood exchange/bartering system in which people in the neighborhood offered various expertise/services to other neighbors. For instance, one retired senior might offer after-school tutoring in reading for elementary school kids. In exchange, the tutor would receive a certificate of appreciation, the satisfaction of having made an important contribution to a neighbor’s welfare, and perhaps even some home-baked cookies from the parents. Almost any other type of expertise might be offered or bartered: learning a foreign language, lawn mowing, moving furniture, learning chess, etc. The neighborhood association would verify the identity and reputation of all participants.  Team members: Prachetas Gumaste, Pranali Shinde, Robin Singh, Shariwa Malankar, Yukta Karkera   #### SECOND PLACE ($500): A-R(evolution)  The goal: Create a service business that uses AR (Augmented Reality) technology to create customized virtual holiday light displays that can be seen via AR goggles or your smart phone.  As we have seen with Pokemon Go and other applications, AR is nowadays a relatively well-known technology that can be used to show users animations that appear to be superimposed over real physical structures and spaces.  A key part of this is using GPS coding to exactly match the animation to the physical location. In this way, everyone in a neighborhood might use the service to create animated or stable images of holiday lights or 4th of July fireworks, etc., or these images might be generic decorations or customized for that specific neighbor, including picture of the kids or birthday greetings to grandma, etc., with text written by the neighbor. The entire neighborhood association might get together to buy a group rate, with artists and programmers from the A-R(evolution) service to fulfill individual requests.  Team Revolution members: Mayank Saxena, Vishal Phalke, Gagan Karvolu Gundyadka, Nahush Farkande   #### THIRD PLACE ($300): Do-Hood Donations  The goal: The basic idea of the Do-Hood project is to enable grocery shoppers in the check-out process in supermarkets in affluent neighborhoods to spontaneously donate groceries to residents in poorer areas.  Imagine a shopper about to pay their $100+ grocery bill when a touch screen offers them a chance to donate something (gallon of milk, can of corn, loaf of bread, box of oatmeal, pound of hamburger, etc.) needed by people in another part of the city.  The key to this concept is a very easy-to-use touchscreen offering shoppers a limited list of donations with prices, and perhaps an image of the neighborhood where the donation will go, along with a cumulative record of their donations that year. Perhaps there are rewards for donors when they reach a certain level (“Congratulations! You have donated $100 to your neighbors this year. You are now entitled to a free cupcake from our Kroger bakery.”) The entire system would include a delivery service to distribution centers in the target neighborhoods, perhaps churches or schools. The service would keep track of what food items are most popular in which neighborhoods. Because many supermarket already include touchscreens for the self-check-out stations, this Do-Hood process could begin with a software application.  Team members: Bala Akhil, Rajdeep Battula, Apoorv Awasthi, Apoorva Nagesh, Tejaswini Parlapalli   #### FOURTH PLACE ($200): Community Gardens  The goal: This project focuses on the idea that the city’s existing community gardens could benefit from an online platform that helps them collaborate to plan events, coordinate their planting strategies to avoid duplication, and encourage bartering or trading of produce.  A city-wide harvest festival for all community gardens could attract attention to the movement, promote local produce for local restaurants, trade recipes, host competitions for bragging rights, etc.  Team Girls Next Door members: Aditi Shukla, Puja Mahtani, Shikha Trivedi, Vandana Munjal   #### HONORABLE MENTIONS  Team Eagle: Radhika Bezawada, Veena Mahesh, Manali Bhetaria, Sagar Mhatre, Nisha Nair—Crown Hill neighborhood food distribution and cooking classes Nimisha Thakur —Umbrellas for loneliness and social isolation Drew Avery —Gamified civic engagement for apartment dwellers   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Kylee Peña Alumni Spotlight  July 11, 2019  Kylee Peña (MAS, 2009) has accomplished a great deal in the field of Media Arts and Sciences in the short time since her graduation. She is the Coordinator of the Creative Technologies team at Netflix in Los Angeles, California, and co-President of the non-profit organization Blue Collar Post Collective. Peña generously spent time telling us of her career path to Netflix, her important work supporting emerging talent in the post production field, and the path that brought her to SoIC.  “I was interested in computers as early as I can remember,” says Peña. “I used to ride my bike to a library to use the internet and check out books on HTML! We got our first home computer in 1998, and I immediately went to work digging into the technical side to fuel creative projects. A year or so later, my parents gave me a video camera. And I had been a Drama Club nerd since birth, too. All these things converged into a love of video production: acting out stories and trying to make them work creatively and technically – long before easy streaming export presets and platforms like YouTube existed!” This convergence ended up leading her to the Human-Centered Computing program at SoIC. “IUPUI appealed to me because of the location and the combination of video and computing. I knew I would need to do internships to be successful in the industry, and staying in my small town wasn’t an option because there weren’t any production companies. Going to a school in Indianapolis offered me a lot of options for interning, working my way through school (at the Indianapolis Zoo, an amazing workplace for a student), and living in different neighborhoods. It seemed to me like a strong technical background was going to be important for creating a strong career baseline, so the School of Informatics’ curriculum stood out to me.”  Her training, hard work and ambition eventually landed her at Netflix. Peña remembers: “I came to work for Netflix like I got every other opportunity in the industry: networking, preparation, and good timing. I’m very involved in the community and attend or participate in industry events whenever possible. The not-so-secret to success: these events aren’t just for adding LinkedIn connections, they’re for developing real relationships. People are people, not commodities, and they want to hire people they like who are also incredibly good at their jobs.” Her current position is Coordinator of the Creative Technologies team. “The Creative Technologies team advocates for best practices and high production standards, evolves the tools and craft of motion picture production, and ensures that Netflix Originals achieve the optimal viewing experience and greatest longevity possible. In short, if it’s a technology that is used by creatives – on set, in post, in the machine room, anywhere – we work with it, including researching, evaluating, educating, and developing best practices and standards relating to all this technology,” Peña explains. “I help to project manage the team and bring cohesion to all these projects all happening simultaneously.”  Peña is passionate about providing support to new talent emerging in her field, and one of the ways she provides this support is through her role as co-President of the Blue Collar Post Collective. “Blue Collar Post Collective is a grassroots non-profit organization that seeks to support emerging talent in post production. It’s the only non-profit that works for this underserved group, which consists of a far more diverse body of individuals than are generally seen in more traditionally visible positions. That’s because underrepresented people are less likely to be able to do a lot of unpaid work or less likely to benefit from casual mentorship from people who look like them. They work swing shift and overnights, so they can’t take advantage of workshops that happen during evenings through the week – if they can even afford them, since they’re paid less, too! So they struggle through early-to-mid career and tend to leave the industry in much greater numbers. BCPC breaks all these barriers and tries to open the door wider for everyone through regular meet-ups in several cities, lots of online activity especially on Facebook, and free educational events. We also have a charitable program called the Professional Development Accessibility Program, which sends lower income professionals to important industry events where they belong.” Peña has not only helped lead this organization for the past several years, she has overseen its tremendous growth as well, with membership numbers rising from 4,000 to over 12,000 members during her tenure as co-President. “I helped to bring the organization to Los Angeles from its roots in New York and grew it to London and Adelaide, Australia… Working with emerging talent is important to me because my “emerging” years were especially hard. I was underpaid, overworked, and often directionless. Being from the midwest and from a blue collar upbringing, I didn’t have connections in the industry or a clear path. And I had a tremendous amount of privilege to leverage.”  Peña’s work with BCPC illustrates her excitement about the students and recent graduates who make up the future workforce in Media Technology. “Earlier this year, I participated in a career day event with SMPTE (Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers) and got a chance to hang out with graduating seniors across Southern California,” Peña remembers. “I was amazed at the kinds of questions they were asking me about media and technology because they were looking at angles I had never considered. They demonstrated an interest and empathy in people and the environment that is not common in the industry. They acknowledged the social responsibility of storytellers and those who enable them – because stories can unite us and expose us to so many perspectives and change the world. For like a hundred years, the majority of people in control of above AND below-the-line jobs have all looked the same and thought the same. This hasn’t been changing quickly enough, but we’re beginning to see a potential tipping point. The world is better for it.” She also shared one final piece of advice for our students: “Remember: a college education is only one part of a successful career. You’ve got lots more to do, and you won’t accomplish it alone. Find your team and get to work.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Debaleena Chattopadhyay honored as IUPUI Chancellor’s Scholar  April 25, 2016  For her outstanding achievements and excellence in research, Debaleena Chattopadhyay was named the Indiana University Graduate School 2016 IUPUI Chancellor’s Scholar at the 2016 IUPUI Honors Convocation.  Mid-air gestural interaction, the Internet of Things experience, trusted clinical alerts for physicians, and emotions elicited by computer-modeled characters—these are among the research projects Chattopadhyay undertook since she entered the Ph.D. program at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI in 2011.  Her research is as prolific as it is diverse—Chattopadhyay published an inspiring number of peer-reviewed articles for conferences and journals during her time here.  How to make large screen displays easier to interact with through mid-air gestures is the focus of her dissertation work with Professor Davide Bolchini in the Human-Centered Computing department. In the Advanced Visualization Lab, they placed infrared sensors in front of displays, giving users the freedom to interact without having to hold a device or wear specific gear.  Chattopadhyay will defend her dissertation this summer before she joins the faculty at the University of Illinois at Chicago as a tenure-track assistant professor in the Computer Science department.  In another collaboration with Bolchini and the Regenstrief Institute at IUPUI, Chattopadhyay worked on incorporating trusted advice in drug-drug interaction alerts for helping physicians to avert possible adverse reactions with patients’ other medications before they prescribe something new.  Last summer, her research at Microsoft Research Cambridge in England explored how to lessen fragmented experiences within the Internet of Things. “Having connectivity is not a research problem anymore. The real problem is how to have a fluid experience,” she says.  “I come from computer science where everything is binary—it’s one or it’s zero,” Chattopadhyay says. She is fascinated by the intersection of that background and the cognitive psychology of human beings, “where everything is fuzzy.”  In her work with School of Informatics and Computing Professor Karl MacDorman, Chattopadhyay explored visual perceptions and emotional responses to computer-generated characters such as avatars—her specific focus in research about the uncanny valley—the phenomenon that causes aversion to computer-generated figures or humanoid robots that bear a near-identical resemblance to human beings.  Chattopadhyay empirically validated a mathematical model for predicting human emotions to variances in visual features, like eyes and noses. The model allowed her to ask fundamental questions surrounding why we react to what is “too human”—such as a fear of mortality.  “Intellectual stimulation is the reason why someone enters a Ph.D. program,” says Chattopadhyay. Ideas are actively nurtured at the School of Informatics and Computing and at IUPUI in general, she says. “It’s very rewarding to see people understanding and connecting to research on this campus.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## IUPUI students devise innovative concepts to help people who are homeless, hungry  October 21, 2019  (Story contributed by Rich Schneider, originally published October 16, 2019)  Twenty-one IUPUI students gathered Oct. 11 in the mayor’s conference room on the 25th floor of the City-County Building to present their solutions to a difficult social problem: How do you reconnect people to society who have become homeless or are unsure when they will eat next?  As Jeff Bennett, Indianapolis deputy mayor for community development, slipped into a seat next to the students, Steven Mannheimer, a media arts and science professor, and Lou Lenzi, a professor of practice in the School of Informatics and Computing, set the stage.  “The problem so many of these people have, whether it’s food insecurity or homelessness, is that they’ve lost their connection to the fabric of society that sustains the rest of us without our even thinking about it,” Mannheimer said.  Mannheimer and Lenzi were co-managers of a two-week design sprint workshop titled “Designing the Reconnected Community,” which culminated in the students’ presentations.  The following were among the students’ innovative solutions to replace those lost connections:  A conversation between Mannheimer, Lenzi and Bennett sparked the idea for the design sprint workshop. The 21 students who presented their concepts were selected from among a larger group of students who applied to participate in the design sprint.  The term “design sprint” stems from the use of design thinking — a solutions-based, creative process used to address challenges — and the speed at which the workshops proceed, in this case, just two weeks instead of months.  The students selected for the design sprint divided into six teams ranging from two to four people. They chose a particular reconnection to focus on, engaged in extensive research and brainstormed their solutions.  Following the presentations, a total of $3,000 was divided among the teams, provided by the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research:  Lenzi said the point of the exercise was to “sensitize students to the needs of the community, when it comes to the homeless and those who face food insecurity, and have them begin to think about ways to approach those needs.  “We didn’t expect them to design a silver bullet to solve a particular problem in two weeks,” he continued. “But their work may provide a trigger for the mayor’s office or a community organization to pursue these concepts further.”  And the students walked away with more than cash in their pockets. They took away a set of creative problem-solving skills to address other challenges as well.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Library of Congress internship informs MLIS student’s future as curator and creator of multicultural stories  August 24, 2022  School of Informatics and Computing graduate student Khrisma McMurray is already gaining real-world experience with her summer internship at the Library of Congress. McMurray is pursuing a Master’s in Library and Information Science (MLIS) with a specialization in Facilitated Learning and participated in the Junior Fellows Program in the Informal Learning Office.  [Master’s in Library and Information Science](https://luddy.iupui.edu/lis/master-library-science/)  McMurray learned about this internship through Dr. Tabitha Hardy at the IUPUI Graduate School Office and says the experience has helped her career wise because as a new student in the MLIS program, especially one who came straight from undergraduate, she didn’t have as much work experience as her classmates. “As I learned about librarianship and information science I desired to get a variety of experience within this field. Working at the Library of Congress has helped me learn more through education and exposure to the various ways I can use my MLIS degree to make an impact in my community and country,” she said.  The Informal Learning Office exists to connect kids, teens, and families to the collections and resources of the Library by developing programs, resources, and learning spaces that inspire them to use the Library for their own creative purposes. During McMurray’s internship, she contributed to the content of the new Southwest Corridor, a new 5,700 square foot experiential learning space in the Library of Congress’ Thomas Jefferson Building. The Southwest Corridor will be a user-driven, flexible, and participatory space for intergenerational family groups and school groups, with a focus on ages 9-13. While visitors of all ages will be given the chance to open-explore curated replicas of Library collections, visitors will also have an opportunity to dive deeper by exploring discovery boxes, which will be a core component of the experience. In her role, McMurray developed content for a prototype of two primary source “quest/discovery boxes” based on the Library’s vast collection.  McMurray started grad school in SPEA in the Masters of Public Affairs program but still had the desire to be a librarian and be more connected to the community she wanted to serve. She decided after one semester to switch to the program that she had been interested in all her life.  “My grandmother grew up in a time where libraries were segregated institutions. Even with the Civil Rights Act being passed, there was still discrimination in place that prohibited her from fully taking advantage of libraries for education or information services. This lack of knowledge and usage of the library carried down generations to me, a young black woman who has desired to enter the field of library science since childhood, but whose family carried generational trauma and lack of knowledge of how to support me in that dream,” McMurray said.  Following graduation, McMurray wants to curate collections for minority youth that provide mirrors to their own lives and windows into other cultures they are not allowed to learn in school. “I want to create community-based programming that creates a multigenerational impact for families. As a future librarian, I want to go further than stocking the shelves with a limited number of multicultural stories. I aspire to use my love of literature and desire for representativeness to enter into the publishing industry. I want to publish and promote multicultural stories to help generate the larger supply of multicultural literature needed for future generations to see their skin color reflected in the black and white pages of books across the country,” she said.  She has already published her first children’s book, Precious Love , which is about being in a blended family and dealing with absentee fathers. “As an author, I strive to redefine our definition of family through spotlighting family structures outside of the typical two parent household.”  McMurray offered this advice to others looking for relevant career experience: Don’t be afraid to go for internships that seem outside of your league. Most employers are looking for fresh eyes and perspectives.   ### About the Junior Fellows Program  The Library of Congress Junior Fellows Program is an annual summer internship program that enables undergraduate and graduate students to experience the integrated analog and digital collections and services of the world’s largest, all-inclusive library. Working under the direction of Library curators and specialists in various divisions, fellows explore digital initiatives and increase access to the institution’s unparalleled collections and resources.

    "body": "  ## Students Study Abroad in Paros, Greece – combining service learning, coursework and real-world experience  October 6, 2015  This past summer, eleven students and two faculty members from the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI traveled to the Greek Isles to use their knowledge of informatics to help preserve and celebrate a nation’s culture and history. This unique service-learning course, “Documenting Historical Cultural Artifacts and Traditions in Paros, Greece”, was offered during Summer Session I.  Paros is part of the Cyclades island group in the Aegean Sea. Inhabited since 3200 BC, Paros is one of the Cyclades’ most picturesque islands, known for its exquisite beaches, traditional villages, hilly countryside, vineyards and incredible food. Today, the island is one of Greece’s most popular destinations for international visitors.  The service-learning course engaged students in the creation of a video about a unique archeological site on the nearby island of Despotiko. Students finished the entire project in three weeks, developing and producing all the necessary digital media, including video, 3D animations, graphics and photography.  The main documentary, Despotiko: An Unknown Treasure, is showcased on the local Paros website, parosweb.com, and also on the School of Informatics and Computing website and can be viewed at this link: https://vimeo.com/134105970 .  [https://vimeo.com/134105970](https://vimeo.com/134105970)  Some shorter videos culled from interviews were also produced and can be viewed here:  The Essence of Parian Marble  https://vimeo.com/134438371  [https://vimeo.com/134438371](https://vimeo.com/134438371)  The Birth of Apollo  https://vimeo.com/134438372  [https://vimeo.com/134438372](https://vimeo.com/134438372)  The Discovery of an Unknown Treasure  https://vimeo.com/134438373  [https://vimeo.com/134438373](https://vimeo.com/134438373)  In the classroom, students met daily to discuss production techniques regarding how to document cultural artifacts and historical sites, as well as to provide updates on project management and works-in-progress. In addition to being immersed in the local daily life of Paros’ main town of Parikia, where the group was housed in a small villa, everyone enjoyed field trips to archeological sites, museums, and a snorkeling trip.  Project leaders Albert William, and Thomas Lewis, both lecturers in the Media Arts and Science program at the School of Informatics and Computing, were very pleased with the efforts of the students and the resulting videos. “The residents of Paros expressed a great appreciation for all of the efforts that went into the project and how it has been able to bring a greater understanding of a little known, but very significant, cultural treasure,” said William. The hope is that more IUPUI students will be visiting Paros in future years to document more cultural sites that are not well known. Currently, plans are in the making to return for Summer Session I in 2016.  Study Abroad in Paros, Greece is offered May 19 through June 10, 2016, and is open to all IUPUI students in good standing. Applications are being accepted through the Study Abroad Office until January 15, 2016. The Study Abroad Office can be reached online at www.abroad.iupui.edu , through email at abroad@iupui.edu , or by phone at (317) 274-2081.

The students, led by Department of Human-Centered Computing adjunct professor Kirkley, won all three contests in which they participated and took  first, second, and third overall awards, winning over $25K.  [Tech to Protect Challenge](https://www.techtoprotectchallenge.org/)  [Department of Human-Centered Computing](https://luddy.iupui.edu/hcc/)  The Tech to Protect Challenge consists of 10 separate contests for which teams must design and develop a possible solution. Each contest is designed to develop new, creative technologies to address issues faced by fire, law enforcement, and EMS emergency responders. The Challenge was held in multiple cities throughout the year and culminates in a national competition in Boulder, CO.  The multidisciplinary IUPUI team worked on and presented three products in Pittsburgh: ZENEXT, an AI-enabled hands-free technology for law enforcement; ALIKE, a cloud services application for fire departments and homeowner use; and SECURE MATRIX, a UX/UI 360 degree dashboard for network security. They also presented earlier versions of ZENEXT and ALIKE in Chicago at the Motorola Corporate HQ in September where they won two contests and earned first and third place overall, as well as $17K.  Lou Lenzi , professor of practice at the School of Informatics and Computing, has been involved with several student teams over the past couple of years. He says “From my perspective as mentor on the student’s ZENEXT submission, their results in this nationwide NIST-sponsored design challenge clearly demonstrates the high-degree of quality of both our students and our curriculum in the Department of Human-Centered Computing.”  [Lou Lenzi](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/lou-lenzi/)  The students heard about Tech to Protect when several of them participated in the AT&T FirstNet Hackathon in Indianapolis earlier in 2019. They recruited Dr. Kirkley, a UX designer and product manager who has worked on numerous startups. Once the team was in place, they began preparing for the competition.  Srivastava, Tseng, and Khan are graduate students studying human-computer interaction at the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI. Majumdar, a graduate of the master’s program in applied data science is an IT Technical Analyst at Cummins, Inc., and Ejanthkar is a computer science graduate student at Purdue School of Science at IUPUI.

The team travels next to UNLV in January and will participate in online qualifiers in hopes of being selected for the national competition in April.  UPDATE (May 1, 2020): The Zenext team this evening garnered two major awards at the NIST TechtoProtect Challenge finals for their project, Transforming Public Safety, Heads Up, Hands Free. They won their category as well as seed funding for a total of $70K to move ahead with a final demo in November 2020.   ### About ZENEXT  ZENEXT: Transforming Public Safety through AI-enabled Hands-Free Technology is a voice command virtual assistant. It makes law enforcement officers’ communication and handling of mission-critical emergencies easier, enabling them to perform their best in moments that matter the most.

    "body": "  ## Attendance at the Grace Hopper Celebration changes students’ lives  October 5, 2018  Each year since 2012, female students from the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI have traveled to the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing (GHC), fondly known as Grace, as part of an initiative to broaden participation and gender diversity in informatics. The initiative was co-founded by Bobby Schnabel, former IU School of Informatics and Computing dean, who asked, “What better way to encourage women (in IT) than to connect them to each other?”  [Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing](https://ghc.anitab.org/)  Rear Admiral Grace Murray Hopper was one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark 1 computer and invented the first computer language compiler, leading to the development of the COBOL programming language.  In 2017, attendance at GHC hit a record 18,000. This year’s celebration, held in Houston, hosted close to 20,000 attendees that included fourteen women and two staff members from IUPUI.  Vicki Daugherty , Program Manager and Diversity Coordinator, and Pat Rhodes, Career Services Specialist, both from the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, accompanied the group this year. Among the highlights: One current student was offered a job on the spot, and a former student was seen recruiting for her new employer, Accenture. Yet another SoIC alumna, who attended GHC as a student and is now an assistant professor at the University of Illinois, returned with her own students this year.  [Vicki Daugherty](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/vicki-daugherty/)   ### The continuing impact of Grace Hopper  When you hear staff and students alike speak of Grace in an awed, almost reverent tone, you know it must be something special. Notably, it is the largest gathering of women technologists in the world. Presented by the Anita Borg Institute for Women in Technology and the Association for Computing Machinery, and sponsored by Computing Research Association-Women, the three-day conference is designed to bring together women in computing to discuss research and career interests.  But beyond the sheer size and spectacle of “Amazing” Grace is the deep, meaningful connection that the event provides to women of all professional levels. Their personal stories reflect the lasting impact that Grace, and the eponymous Grace Hopper, has made in their lives and on their futures.  “This conference is simply empowering,” said Daugherty. “To see oneself among 20,000-plus technical women is inspiring, and the networking opportunities are abundant.”  Daugherty and Rhodes help prepare the students for their participation. “Attendance in 2015 was 15K—immense. We talked about Grace with past participants about how to make the most of the experience,” said Daugherty.  She encourages students to apply for conference scholarships and to submit posters. Scholarships are supported by industry sponsors, which gives extra access.  Rhodes advises on preparation for the GHC Career Fair, reviewing resumes, and tips and strategies on negotiating offers.  Another piece of advice: posting resumes to the online database can lead to invites to industry receptions and job interviews.  Daugherty points to two IUPUI informatics alumnae who made important connections at Grace.  Chelsea Bedel, whose sister Bridget is a current student at the school, interviewed with MasterCard at GHC, obtained a summer internship, and was offered a job before graduating in 2014. While working as an analyst at MasterCard, Bedel went back to Grace in 2015 and invited the IUPUI women to a MasterCard reception.  Another alumna, Sarah (Parker) Raheja, went to Grace as a junior. Representatives of the General Electric IT leadership program saw her resume online and hired her into their program. Parker now works for GE in Atlanta as a senior UX designer and blogs about why Grace is so important to women in IT.   ### Opportunities and more opportunities  In fall 2016, 10 IUPUI informatics women, along with Rhodes and former career advisor Stephanie Marshall, attended GHC. Professor Sara Anne Hook also attended and presented with graduate student Cori Faklaris at a student opportunity lab.  “I was blown away by the number of women in attendance as well as the awesome career fair. The conference offered our students, as well as myself, an opportunity to network and learn from so many individuals in the field,” said Rhodes. Marshall added, “It was awesome to able to support these girls one-on-one as they navigated the career fair, attended sessions, and mingled at company-sponsored events. Overall, it was an exciting professional development experience for not only our girls who attended, but myself, as well.”  Students Hanlin Li and Adriana Alvarado Garcia each presented research posters. “As a student looking for a Ph.D. program, I benefited from GHC because I got the opportunity to talk with Ph.D. students and scholars coming from different universities and know more about their programs,” Li said.  Alvarado Garcia added, “I had the opportunity to go to a couple of sessions of researchers that are working on topics that I am interested in and I had the opportunity to talk with them. I really appreciated the chance to talk face-to-face with them and ask them directly about their methods and research process.”  Years after her career in IT ended, Grace Murray Hopper’s legacy and influence lives on at GHC. And the IUPUI scholarships will continue to give our students the opportunity to meet others in their field, learn important lessons from women who’ve made it, and make ongoing contacts that may help launch their careers.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## IUPUI students say internship program delivers on promise for unique summer experience  October 29, 2019  (Contributed by Rich Schneider, originally published August 7, 2019)  Imagine a summer college internship program that promises the best summer of your life.  Such a program is available through Infosys, a multinational company that provides IT services and business consulting.  The program begins by paying for visa fees and roundtrip airplane tickets to bring students to the Infosys headquarters in Bangalore, India.  The all-expenses-paid internship then covers the cost of students’ food and housing in Bangalore. Housing accommodations are on the Infosys gated, corporate campus. One student said their living quarters look like a five-star hotel.  And the program pays the interns a salary.  There are chauffeur-driven cars and a health club membership, among other benefits. Students are assigned to work on projects they’ve dreamed of, including artificial intelligence, big data, cybersecurity and cloud computing.  The icing on the cake: The opportunity to experience the diversity of India. Because the cost of travel is low, interns travel on weekends to explore the country.  Sound too good to be true?  Not for five undergraduate and graduate students from the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI who were selected for the Infosys global internship program, InStep.  The IUPUI students are among 120 InStep interns from around the world who are engaged in eight- to 12-week InStep internships. Two of the IUPUI students talked with us from India by phone about their experiences since arriving in Bangalore.  Courtnee Cruz, a graduate health informatics student, summed up her experiences since she arrived June 3 with a single word: Incredible. “Every time someone back home asks about it, I can’t even describe it because it is so unique, so different from the U.S.,” she said.  Cruz always wanted to work abroad but had assumed if she did, it would be in Europe. Then she learned about the Infosys internship program. “I saw where it was and thought it was really cool,” she said. “The other main thing was that it is an all-expenses-paid internship, which is rare, and I’m also paid very well. It’s really nice.”  After being interviewed by Infosys about what she wanted to work on, Cruz was asked to design software to predict unexpected hospital visits from patients with chronic diseases. The software is being developed for a major U.S. health insurance firm.  Cruz heads to work about 9 a.m. on weekdays, remaining there until 7 or 8 p.m. Her Infosys colleagues routinely work 10 to 11 hours a day. “That’s very normal, but work is also very social for them,” she said. “There are lots of tea and exercise breaks during the day.”  Interns plan outings to city restaurants, pubs or a cricket match — if not every weekday evening, then every other day, she said. Cruz also travels around India every weekend. Trips to Goa on the southwestern coast and to Kochi, a major port city on the southwestern coast bordering the Laccadive Sea, where she spent the weekend aboard a houseboat, top her list of favorite trips.  Andres Calvillo, an undergraduate majoring in informatics with a specialization in human computer interaction, has also explored India on the weekends, including trips to the Taj Mahal and to the capital, New Delhi.  “As a college student, I never expected to be able to travel to a completely different part of the world,” Calvillo said. “I’m grateful.”  Calvillo said he wanted to participate in the internship program as soon as he learned about it: “An all-expenses-paid trip to Bangalore, India, sounded like a really great opportunity to travel and develop my professional skills.”  He was assigned a project to create a solution using computer vision to detect office space availability. His work has included conducting focus groups and creating user personas to better understand users of the service.  Calvillo and Cruz said the program is managed in such a way that safety is not a concern, a factor they believe led some IUPUI students to not apply for the internship.  “Safety is not a huge concern,” Calvillo said. “The internship program offers an opportunity to explore different parts of the world, to get to know what it’s like to travel and work in India. It’s a very unique opportunity.”  “I would encourage people to apply to the program,” Cruz said. “You’ll be in good hands. Everyone speaks English, everything is taken care of, and you will be with people from all over the world.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

The challenge was to find discernible patterns of meaningful information in the genomic data of 38 human subjects (7 terabytes of genome data) from the Korean Personal Genome Project.    The team developed an innovative systems biology pipeline for the analysis of next generation sequencing (NGS) data, focusing on the interrelationships between genes with rare variants. Through their innovative big data analytics methods, they identified the prevalence of genes in two major domains: neurodegenerative diseases and tumor related genes. This observation suggests that the Korean population might be more susceptible to these two major classes of complex diseases, when compared with other populations.  The computing power necessary for the project involved some 100 terabytes of storage and 100 gigabytes of RAM, generously provided by IU’s National Center for Genome Analysis Support under Director, Dr. William Barnett.  As one of the winning teams, the group has been invited to present their findings at the CAMDA conference in Berlin, July 19-20 th .   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Informatics alumnus claims his space as Implementation Manager at Wunderkind  July 21, 2022  When Melvin D. Campos Jr. applied to IUPUI he was going to be a Computer Science major. All that changed at orientation when on the advice of a friend, he checked out the School of Informatics and Computing (SoIC) and was intrigued. Four years later, he graduated with a B.S. in Informatics, specializing in Human-Computer Interaction and today works as an Implementation Manager at Wunderkind in their Indianapolis location.  [Wunderkind](https://www.wunderkind.co/)  Campos credits some of his early success to school staff like academic advisor, Elecia Hadley who helped him navigate college, career services director Pat Rhodes who linked him to internships, Learning Informatics for Tomorrow (LiFT) program director Molly Morin who selected him as a peer mentor and “gave me some of the best career advice ever,” and diversity coordinator Vicki Daugherty who helped with whatever he needed. “Some highlights of my time at SOIC were definitely being a peer mentor for LiFT, attending the Tapia conference in Orlando, and learning things that I use in my everyday job now!”  As of July 1, 2022, Campos was promoted from Implementation Associate to Implementation Manager at Wunderkind, which is headquartered in New York City and offers one-to-one, individualized multi-channel marketing solutions for e-commerce. He is the technical point of contact and the project manager of the onboarding process and serves as a liaison for a variety of internal teams (QA, Integration, Engineering, etc) to help communicate requirements to some top-level, high-profile clients. Campos manages the project from start to finish and makes sure all deliverables are given at a timely manner to keep the project in track, allowing clients to tap into the greater Wunderkind network so emails can be sent on their behalf.  Campos is also serving as a Co-Lead for an Employee Resource Group, Somoskind, for the LatinX Wunderkinds, where his job is to foster a safe space for all Wunderkinds who identify as LatinX, and where he was also the first Implementation Associate hired at Wunderkind and the first Latino hired on the Implementation Team.  “What I love most about my job is working with clients! At first, I was super scared to even talk to clients but building those relationships is definitely fun. I also enjoy keeping the project on track and problem solve when issues arise! As Co-Lead, my favorite part is connecting with other LatinX at my company and realizing I’m not in white corporate America alone. I have brothers, sisters and ‘theysters’ who experience the same things I do as a brown Latino in corporate America,” Campos says.  Of his long-term goals, Campos says he hasn’t “thought that far out yet but as of now, I’m just enjoying my time at Wunderkind!”  Campos offers this advice to others starting out their journey: “Having a college degree will always hold more weight than not having one. Your hard work doesn’t go unnoticed. Keep striving and working hard because it’s for a better cause. For all my brown and black kids, I’m going to give you the advice I was given in my junior year of college. You’re going to be the only Brown/Black person in these predominantly white spaces but just know, you’re kicking down these doors to let more of us in these spaces. It starts with you. Keep pushing….and if anyone ever tells you, you’re not able to do it, prove them wrong! You got this!!”     ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## 2018 grads already giving back by establishing a new SoIC scholarship  December 13, 2018  ( Story submitted by Cory Aiello )  Mikaylah Gross (BS Informatics ‘16 and MS Human Computer Interaction ’18) and Hannah Roper (BS Informatics ‘18) are recent IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI (SoIC) graduates already making a difference by giving back to their school.  They have stepped up together to establish the Make Your Mark Scholarship to benefit current SoIC students who are making a positive difference in the world using technology. For Gross and Roper, this scholarship is both the fulfillment of a long-time goal and a way to honor their time at SoIC.  When considering what attracted them to SoIC early in their college careers, both Gross and Roper used the same word: Community .  Remembering her early search for a major at IUPUI, Gross said, “I felt frustrated in my previous degree program, like I was wasting my money while not finding exactly what I was looking for. Then, I ran into Vicki Daugherty, who knew me from a previous award I won in high school. She mentioned that I should try out SoIC, which prompted me to sample a few class offerings. Right away, I knew that this school was a much better fit for me. There is a sense of community within SoIC, because everybody feels like family and is supportive of each other’s goals and aspirations. I loved that SoIC made my degree feel unique and customizable.”  Roper agreed, stating “I owe so much of who I am today to SoIC and specifically to Vicki Daugherty.  As I was deciding between IUB and IUPUI, I met with her to talk about the campus and SoIC overall. In that two-hour meeting, she showed me the community and family-like atmosphere that SoIC had cultivated. SoIC and the Informatics degree was the perfect fit for me because I could still be true to who I am while helping others find their passions in tech.”  Vicki Daugherty, SoIC diversity coordinator said “In my role, I have had the privilege to work with many great SoIC students over the years and I have seen Mikaylah and Hannah foster a sense of belonging in others while instilling confidence in them as well as the desire to pursue careers in technology.  These dedicated women have also set the bar for near-peer mentoring activities as part of the Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce (iDEW) program in Indianapolis area high schools.  I was overwhelmed about their establishment of the Make Your Mark Scholarship as young professionals just starting their careers.  But I am not surprised, as this generosity reflects who they are as people.”   ### Catalysts for positive change  SoIC provided many opportunities for Gross and Roper that went beyond what they considered the typical college experience. Hannah remembered, “Mikaylah and I met each other through STARS Computing Corps, and we became the type of friends who push each other to pursue their life-long dreams and go in search of what makes you happy, aka best friends.” Gross was able to check a number of items off what she calls her “mental bucket list” as she completed her career at SoIC, including traveling the world, leading women in tech organizations, and teaching several classes and workshops.  But there was one particular item on the list to which she kept returning.  “I kept saying to myself that I wanted to start a scholarship, but it wasn’t a wise decision financially for what I could afford at the time, so I chose to focus on finishing my education. The minute I graduated, I reflected back on the list in my mind and thought, ‘Oh, I still haven’t accomplished this’. I actually reached out to Hannah and said, ‘I have this idea. I really want to start a scholarship, and you’re going to have to tell me if that sounds crazy or not.’ Right away, she stated ‘no it’s not, because I’ll do it with you.’”  In determining the requirements for their scholarship, it was important to Gross and Roper to make as many SoIC students eligible as possible, while ensuring that the recipient demonstrated passion in the field of informatics and computing. “It’s open to any student who is intrinsically motivated to make a difference in the field of technology, whether it be in the industry, academia, or through service leadership.” Gross continued, “We’ve seen shining examples of these students at our school already, so we would like to recognize and support them with hopes that they will continue pursuing their passions and inspiring future generations of technology leaders.  “Any sophomore, junior or senior from or outside of Indiana may qualify. In addition, there is no minimum GPA requirement, because I believe that GPA doesn’t truly represent the talent, passion, and drive that someone might have towards technology; rather I think it’s the engagement, involvement, and impact that shows a more accurate reflection of a student’s efforts to learn and grow.  As long as the student is in good academic standing, they will have an opportunity for this scholarship.” They decided to call it the Make Your Mark Scholarship because, as Roper explained, “We are always striving to make our mark wherever we go and whoever we encounter because the world needs more change makers. No matter how small the action, anything can be that catalyst for positive change.”  Mikaylah and Hannah hope that their scholarship can help as many students as possible while inspiring others to give back in whatever way they can. “I’m hoping that in the near future, we can either make this a recurring scholarship to support students for up to three years, or provide more scholarships to expand to even more students,” Mikaylah said.  If you would like to learn how to contribute to the Make Your Mark Scholarship , or if you would like to contribute to SoIC in another way, please contact SoIC’s Director of Development Stacy Zearing at szearing@iupui.edu.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

That’s one of the questions Karl F. MacDorman explores through his research into human–robot interaction—how we perceive the humanness of social robots and computer agents, including the voices of virtual AI assistants such as Alexa, Cortana, Siri, and Google Assistant. He’s been quoted on artificial intelligence and social computing in publications including the Wall Street Journal, Geekwire , and Wired .  [Geekwire](http://www.geekwire.com/2016/why-is-ai-female-how-our-ideas-about-sex-and-service-influence-the-personalities-we-give-machines/)  [Wired](https://www.wired.com/2015/10/why-siri-cortana-voice-interfaces-sound-female-sexism/)  As part of his human–computer interaction research, MacDorman also has examined how we perceive computer-animated characters, and the ability of computers to recognize visual stimuli such as hand gestures. He’s published more than 100 papers in HCI, robotics, machine learning, and cognitive science.  Before joining IU, MacDorman was an associate professor at Osaka University, Japan (2003–2005).

Thomas Lewis is a senior lecturer at the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering in Indianapolis and the director of the media arts and science program. Lewis bridges his teaching with his active artistic practice in film and video. Lewis’ artistic practice demonstrates the power of narrative and documentary storytelling. In his teaching, Lewis has refined a pedagogical approach centered on learning-through-doing, and he brings students into his many projects, giving them real-world experience and preparing them for their future success as filmmakers and creatives.  As co-director of the Greece study abroad course, Documenting Historical Cultural Artifacts and Traditions in Paros, Greece , Lewis has brought six groups of students to the island. Through close collaboration with the residents, the students have created over 60 films that directly contribute to the historical and cultural preservation of Paros. In this facilitated experiential learning context, students have been able to develop their voices as filmmakers while actively engaging with Parian culture.  [60 films](https://vimeo.com/showcase/5376684)  From 2017- 2021, Lewis worked on Opioid Stories , a project that examined the impact of the opioid epidemic in Indiana through a series of narrative films, first-person interviews, and a documentary. These films tell the stories of those affected and those who work to confront the problem. Students worked in the planning, production, and post-production of these films. The Long Run , a documentary that follows the story of Wes Doty who overcame addiction to become a dedicated marathon runner, was an official selection at Heartland’s Indy Shorts Film Festival, the Indianapolis Film Festival in 2021, and was screened in festivals across the US.  [Opioid Stories](http://opioidstories.org/)  Prior to working on Opioid Stories , Lewis took two filmmaking trips to Kenya in which he developed several films that explored the stigma and lack of information around HIV. Working cross-disciplinarily with medical professionals and an anthropologist, Lewis collaborated with students at Moi University to create the series. These films have been shown at festivals across the US and Africa. The making of these films was presented at the 21 st International Aids Conference in Durban, South Africa.  [These films](http://hiv-films.org/)  Not only does Lewis explore the possibilities of filmmaking with his socially impactful documentary and narrative work, but he also pushes the boundaries of what is possible within the field of video art. Since 2012, he has explored how video-mapping technologies can provide an audience with an immersive experience in which they can ask questions about the nature of perception. Most recently, he contributed a video-mapping installation to Fix: Heartbreak and Hope in Our Opioid Crisis , on view at the Indiana State Museum.  Lewis received his M.F.A. in film from CalArts in 1993, where he studied with filmmakers James Benning, Thom Andersen, and Betzy Bromberg. He then worked professionally in video and film production in Los Angeles for sixteen years. From 2001 to 2009, he produced DVD bonus materials for major motion pictures, including the Harry Potter franchise.  Lewis brings the experiences of his rigorous and ongoing creative practice back into the classroom. He teaches by doing—demonstrating how to challenge oneself, be open to learning, and adapt to the changing landscape of emergent video technologies. As a practicing filmmaker, he shares with his students that being a filmmaker is a not simply a title, but a lens for constant engagement as a participant in the world.   ### Research Interests   ### Courses  NEWM N353 Intermediate Digital Video  [NEWM N353](https://luddy.iupui.edu/courses/newm-n353/)  NEWM N354 Directorial Analysis, Production, and RAW Workflow  [NEWM N354](https://luddy.iupui.edu/courses/newm-n354/)  NEWM-N 356 Lighting and Field Production  [NEWM-N 356](https://luddy.iupui.edu/courses/newm-n356/)  NEWM N357 Digital Effects  [NEWM N357](https://luddy.iupui.edu/courses/newm-n357/)  NEWM N456 Digital Cinema  [NEWM N456](https://luddy.iupui.edu/courses/newm-n456/)  NEWM-N 468 Video for Social Change  [NEWM-N 468](https://luddy.iupui.edu/courses/newm-n468/)   ### Outside Media   ### Short film ‘Michael’ is long on impact  IUPUI’s own C.

    "body": "  ## Graduate students innovate solutions for Endress+Hauser industrial customers  August 3, 2022  Recently, Endress+Hauser in Greenwood, Indiana invited human-computer interaction (HCI) students from the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI Professor of Practice Lou Lenzi’s H-567 Internet-of-Things Interface Design and Business Innovation class to engage with several of their customers to review their current water monitoring/sensoring processes and propose design changes to improve their operations. Endress+Hauser produces and sells their Netilion solution for global water treatment monitoring/sensoring, which has applications across a number of regional Indiana industries.  [H-567 Internet-of-Things Interface Design and Business Innovation](https://luddy.iupui.edu/courses/info-h567/)  “By partnering with a global leader in process automation and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), this 10-week project allowed our students to apply their knowledge of human-centered design methods to a real-world design challenge. This Digital Transformation (DX) project also serves as a centerpiece of their portfolio of projects as an HCI graduate student,” Lenzi said.  Each team was assigned mentors from their client company and support personnel from Endress+Hauser and spent time learning the product, business model, business environment, customers, and processes, and finding solutions using design thinking concepts and analysis. The student teams then presented their solutions to the client, including identification of pain points and recommendations to improve things such as monitoring/sensoring, employee communication, and product marketing.  Nicole Otte, Director of Workforce Development at Endress+Hauser said, “We have been anxiously awaiting the final presentations from IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI IOT and Business Innovation Course. These students have been working the past 10 weeks with our Endress+Hauser team to design and develop innovative end-user experiences around NWNI for some of our customers. These students knocked it out of the park and provided viable solutions. Special thanks to all involved for making this a fruitful learning experience for these students.”   ### Team 1: Effluent Monitoring. Manohar Antalkali, Vishal Phalke and Vanya Srivastava, team members; Ryan Williams mentor Endress+Hauser  Phalke said, “As this was our first industrial project, there were several challenges in the way. Professor Lou Lenzi, on the other hand, led us through every obstacle. Ryan Williams and the Endress+Hauser crew were always willing to answer any questions we had. The 10-week project not only honed our design skills, but also provided in-depth knowledge of different business tools and their application in the industry.”   ### Team 2: Sustainability Monitoring. Nahush Farkande, Vandana Munjal and Manali Bhetaria, team members; Matt Walsh mentor, Endress+Hauser    Farkande said, “We worked on this project over a course of 10 weeks where we were forced to employ our entire design acumen and experienced what it was like to work on a real-world industry project. After countless Red Bull-fueled brainstorming and research sessions, we managed to deliver a solution that catered to the sustainability tracking needs of wastewater treatment companies. What really enabled us to deliver on this project, however, was the constant guidance of our mentor Professor Lou Lenzi, Matt Walsh from Endress+Hauser, and our client.”   ### Team 3: WaterSkid Monitoring. Aditi Shukla, Mayank Saxena, Shariwa Malankar, team members; Jerry Spindler, mentor, Endress+Hauser    Saxena said, “The project helped us gain industry experience by working with client like Endress+Hauser which required problems to be solved. Through various brainstorming sessions and constant feedback from professor Lou, we learned to create a desirable, viable, and feasible solution not only with the right design and technology but business too. The challenge was more exciting to us as we learned and conducted the business viability without which a solution cannot be executed successfully. While working on this project was certainly challenging, we realized the learning impact it had on us and therefore recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn about design, technology, and business.”   ### Team 4: Asset Performance. Apoorva Nagesh and Pranali Shinde, team members; Adam Booth mentor, Endress+Hauser    Shinde said, “As part of our IoT coursework, we worked with the amazing team of Endress+Hauser Group here in Greenwood. In the span of 10 weeks, we learned a lot about user research, customer experience, and the business aspect of design. We had a great time working and building a product for the client. Special thanks to Professor Lou Lenzi for his constant support and guidance and to Adam Booth for helping us at every step of the project.”   ### Team 5: Application Optimization. Eshwar Veesam, Radhika Bezawada, Yukta Karkera, team members; Matt Walsh mentor, Endress+Hauser    “Professor Lou’s class gave us the unique opportunity to work with a global company and understand how they work with their clients and how we, as designers, could help them cater solutions to those clients. The guidance and mentorship we received from Professor Lou over this 10-week project gave us the platform to grow not only as designers but also as business developers and problem solvers,” said Karkera.   ### About the Human-Computer Interaction graduate program  Opportunities in human-computer interaction are increasing daily, in fields including voice recognition, information technology, and the Internet of Things.

    "body": "  ## IU Personalized Medicine Institute to develop targeted and individualized treatments  February 14, 2011  [Posted from IU Home Pages ]  Indiana University has announced a major commitment to research in one of health care’s most promising fields with the creation of the Indiana Institute for Personalized Medicine.  The institute’s members will be drawn from the IU schools of medicine, informatics and nursing, with $11.25 million in funding provided by the School of Medicine, the school’s Department of Medicine, IUPUI, the Indiana Physician Scientist Initiative and the Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer. The Indiana Physician Scientist Initiative is funded by a $60 million grant from the Lilly Endowment.  Building on modern research techniques that have made it possible to decipher the genetic code, detect slight genetic differences between patients and determine how those affect the way the body metabolizes drugs, physicians are beginning to be able to select more appropriate treatments for individual patients. Research to make such tools broadly available remains in the early but promising stages, institute leaders said.  “Much of the future of health care is in personalized medicine, meaning more precise targeting of the right medication to the right patient at the right time,” said Dr. David Flockhart, who has been named director of the institute.  “We believe it should lead to cost benefits — it clearly will be better for patients,” said Flockhart, the Harry and Edith Gladstein Professor of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics and director of the Division of Clinical Pharmacology.  “The Indiana Institute for Personalized Medicine is a not only a logical extension of our academic mission but is also part of our strategic plan to be a global leader in translational medicine,” said Dr. David S. Wilkes, executive associate dean for research affairs at the IU School of Medicine.  Some of the earliest examples of personalized medicine have come in the field of cancer treatment. Oncologists now can test a breast cancer patient’s tumor to determine not only whether it is the type that is stimulated to grow by the hormone estrogen, but whether it is a subtype that can be treated with hormone therapy or another type that requires chemotherapy. Cardiology, pediatrics and obstetrics also will be important areas of focus for the institute, said Flockhart.  “To identify more precisely which drugs are likely to be more effective — or less effective and more toxic — will have a substantial impact on optimizing health care delivery and rationally curbing costs. In no discipline is this more keenly needed than in cancer care where drugs can be extremely costly and toxic,” said Dr. Patrick J. Loehrer Sr., director of the IU Simon Cancer Center.  IU scientists have been working on related research for at least a decade, but creating an institute “allows you to really jump start research and raise the level participation of an institution in both the laboratory and in the clinic, in a broad range of research interests,” Flockhart said.  Janet Carpenter, professor in the School of Nursing and a member of the institute, sees personalized medicine playing a key role in improving the treatment of menopause.  “About 6,000 American women enter menopause every day, yet personalized medicine has not been well-integrated into their health care,” she said. “The institute will play a very important role in ensuring that women receive the most appropriate and effective menopausal symptom management therapies.”  Mathew Palakal, associate dean for graduate studies and research at the School of Informatics and Computing, noted that “research in personalized medicine spans a broad spectrum from systems biology to nanomedicine to gene therapy. Our research in such areas as systems biology, biological network analysis and proteomics, along with our graduate programs in health informatics and bioinformatics, will enable informatics and the School of Informatics and Computing to play a significant role in the success of the institute.”  “This science will enable physicians to prescribe the right medicines at the right dosages and intervals to maximize efficacy and prevent unwanted toxicity. It should be a very exciting next 10 years of research,” said Dr. D. Wade Clapp, chair of the Department of Pediatrics.  “Personalized medicine will make a significant and immediate impact in the care of patients with heart diseases,” said Dr. Peng-Sheng Chen, director of the Krannert Institute of Cardiology.  In addition to Flockhart, the institute’s leadership will include associate directors Dr. Lang Li, associate professor of medical and molecular genetics, and associate director of the IU Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics; Dr. Jamie L. Renbarger, assistant professor of pediatrics, of medicine, and of obstetrics and gynecology; and Dr. Bryan Schneider, assistant professor of medicine, and of medical and molecular genetics.  The institute’s mission is to conduct research, train new specialists in personalized medicine and promote the translation of scientific discoveries into new more precise therapeutics for patient care.  Training new experts will be supported by the new Brater Scholarship in Personalized Medicine, which will provide funds for research to young physicians in medical fellowship training programs at the school of medicine. The first three fellows to receive Brater scholarships will be selected this summer.  To help move scientific discoveries to patient bedsides, the institute will have a panel of IU scientists who will advise researchers on steps to take to move their research beyond the laboratory stages. Clapp will chair the advisory panel, which will initially have 21 members initially.  The institute also has an external advisory board with five members:  • Caryn Lerman, Mary W. Calkins Professor of psychiatry and interim director of the Abramson Cancer Center at the University of Pennsylvania  • Dan Roden, assistant vice chancellor for personalized medicine at Vanderbilt University  • Robert Epstein, president of advanced clinical science and research at Medco Health Solutions Inc.  • Shiew-Mei Huang, deputy director, Office of Clinical Pharmacology, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration  • Russ B. Altman, chairman of the Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University  In addition to Loehrer, Carpenter, Clapp, Flockhart, Renbarger and Schneider are members of the IU Simon Cancer Center. Clapp also is a member of the Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research.

    "body": "  ## Professor’s NEH grant to strengthen rural Utah cultural experience  December 18, 2016  Annette Lamb, senior lecturer in Library and Information Science at the Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, accepted a $50K grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) on behalf of the Entrada Institute in Torrey, Utah, where she is board president and project director.  The Humanities Access grant will spark conversations through context and connections in rural Utah and expand opportunities for the community to connect with cultural and traditional resources.  “Humanities can teach young people habits of critical thinking and historical perspective, along with addressing enduring questions that transcend time and place. Traditional lectures are effective in conveying humanities concepts, but can lack the context, content, and connections needed for an effective youth learning experience,” Lamb said.  Lamb worked with the Entrada Institute to design a community-based program that applies an innovative approach to involving economically disadvantaged youth and their families in meaningful activities that celebrate the human experience—connecting Utah-area partners such as the Wayne County School District, the Wayne County USU Extension and 4-H, Capitol Reef National Park, local humanities individuals and groups, and local officials.  The project ties in directly with Lamb’s teaching areas, which include youth programs, digitization, community partnerships, and humanities sources connected with rural America.  The Humanities Access program offers these grants to enhance and support existing cultural programs for youth, communities of color, and economically disadvantaged populations.  “Humanities Access grants support innovative projects that will help ensure that high-quality cultural programming is available to everyone,” said NEH Chair William D. Adams. “Americans of every age, race, and economic status should be able to access the incredible opportunities that the humanities provide. We are proud to announce this latest group of grantees who, through their projects and research, will bring valuable lessons of history and culture to Americans.”  The School of Informatics and Computing Department of Library and Information Science has expertise in youth and community programs, cultural heritage digitization projects, and the humanities.     ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## R.B. Annis Educational Foundation partners with local workforce development efforts  February 18, 2015  The R.B. Annis Educational Foundation recently joined a growing group of investors in a workforce development project being led by the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI.  Thanks to several local supporters, including a $25,000 gift from R.B. Annis Educational Foundation, school faculty and graduate students will work with high school teachers to bring information technology skills to local high school students to prepare them for academic and future career opportunities in the IT industry.  The Information Technology Diversity-Enhanced Workforce Initiative (iDEW) will engage 90 high school students from three area high schools–Pike, Arsenal Tech, and Providence Christo Rey via a year-round enrichment program that will facilitate their progress towards earning four-year college degrees. The initiative consists of a series of learning engagement modules (LEMS) focused on familiarizing students with core informatics and computing concepts, showcasing real-world application of those concepts, and introducing exciting career opportunities. All LEMs will have an overarching and interactive theme of “Computing for Social Cause” because this has been found attractive to underrepresented students.  A program goal is to increase diversity in the IT workforce where jobs are plentiful, but with a lack of qualified, diverse candidates.  Robert B. Annis was the founder of R.B.

    "body": "  ## Too scary to be real, research looks to quantify eeriness in virtual characters  September 24, 2009  Indiana University’s Karl MacDorman has been to the valley — the uncanny valley of virtual humans so lifelike they give us real humans the creeps. What he’s found is that things don’t look so bad after all.  That’s because MacDorman’s research into human photorealism in robots, androids and computer-generated characters is calling into question a longstanding premise put forth by the pioneering Japanese roboticist Masahiro Mori that people become unsettled by any slight nonhuman imperfection in very human-looking forms. MacDorman is an IU School of Informatics and Computing associate professor in the Human-Computer Interaction program and the director of the IUPUI Android Science Center.  Nearly 40 years ago Mori identified the uncanny valley as that place where zombies, corpses and dancing mannequins reside. Developing impeccably humanlike computer-generated characters that will not fall into the uncanny valley is the Holy Grail for animators in the multi-billion dollar animation and video game industries.  And what MacDorman has found is that it is no longer your parents’ art school.  “What is surprising is that some of the rules you learn in art school do not apply to computer graphics characters,” he said. “For example, artists will typically enlarge the eyes of someone they paint to make the person look more attractive. In fact, artists tend to make their own eyes larger in self-portraits. But our results indicate that eye enlargement can have a decidedly negative effect when photorealistic textures are applied to a human model.”  The same holds true when distorting other facial proportions such as eye separation and face height, as the changes have a more negative impact on very realistic human character models. So caricaturing can be effective for abstract faces, like the ones seen in Pixar’s movie The Incredibles, but fails for human-looking faces like those seen the same year in another film, The Polar Express, that also relied on computer generated imagery.  “The Disney animation of Cinderella’s stepmother can be horrid without being eerie, and Tom Hanks can be warm in Polar Express but still eerie,” MacDorman said. “So our group is devising new scales that can deal with these nuances.” MacDorman has developed the first “eeriness index” to help quantify how virtual characters influence human decision making.  “The index has been developed based on a pilot study, but we want to refine it further in a larger study on animated characters and robots,” he said.  Developing design principles for human-looking characters, MacDorman believes, would not only have a huge economic impact on computer graphic animation and video games, but could also play an integral role in developing long-term beneficial relationships between robots and humans.  “Interventions could range from the treatment of autism to rehabilitation coaching to companionship for the elderly,” he said. “One goal is to create robots and computer generated characters that are capable of interacting with people in humanlike ways to sustain long-term relationships that improve people’s physical, cognitive and social well-being.”  Research results to date reflect subjective measures used with human participants who viewed the characters, but MacDorman and his team plan to use results from objective sources like heart rate, galvanic skin response, electroencephalograms and functional magnetic imaging of the brain to gauge how far designers can go before characters creep out viewers.  His latest published research, “Too real for comfort? Uncanny responses to computer generated faces,” (appearing in Computers in Human Behavior, and co-written with Robert D. Green, Chin-Chang Ho and Clinton T. Koch, all of the IU School of Informatics and Computing), called into question Mori’s predictions that a computer generated face looks the eeriest when it looks nearly human.  “Even abstract faces can look eerie if they contain facets that seem unintended or arbitrary,” MacDorman said.  To view a visualization of two different, side-by-side computer graphic characters as they undergo slight changes in skin and eye realism, visit the Uncanny Valley.  MacDorman’s upcoming research with his colleague, Matthias Scheutz, turns in the direction of virtual versus physical representation influencing ethical decision making made via online and face-to-face interactions. Matthias Scheutz is an associate professor of Cognitive Science, Computer Science, and Informatics and the director of the Human-Robot Interaction Laboratory at Indiana University Bloomington.  “The purpose of one of these upcoming proposals is to determine whether the physical embodiment or virtual representation of a robot can influence human decision-making of ethical consequence,” MacDorman explained.  And a research paper now in review, “Gender Differences in the Impact of Presentational Factors in Human Character Animation on Ethical Decisions about Medical Dilemmas,” indicates that under certain similar conditions men and women make different decisions.  MacDorman, Chin-Chang Ho, Joseph Coram and Himalaya Patel found that using a computer-generated character instead of a human character, or using jerky movements instead of fluid movements, to present participants with an ethical dilemma produced no significant effect on female participants. Male participants, however, were much more likely to rule against the computer-generated character with jerky movements.  “From the standpoint of studying human interaction, it is important to get into and out of the uncanny valley. If you build a robot or computer-generated character that looks human, but you do not animate it well — if its motion looks jerky or the timing of its responses are off — it will look uncanny, no matter how realistic and attractive it looks when still,” MacDorman said. “But this is useful because it indicates when the cognitive model I am testing in an android, or the artificial intelligence used to control a character in a computer game, is not working. The fact that we are so sensitive to flaws in the behavior of human-looking characters means that we know when our models of human interaction are wrong, so we can correct them. This is the beauty of human photorealism. Because if a cartoon character or a less human-looking robot does something that isn’t human, we might not even notice it.”  MacDorman, who is also an adjunct professor with the Purdue School of Engineering and Technology, received a BA in computer science from University of California, Berkeley, in 1988, and a PhD from Cambridge University, United Kingdom, in machine learning and robotics in 1996. rior to coming to the School of Informatics and Computing he was an associate professor at Osaka University, Japan. He has published more than 80 papers in human-computer interaction, robotics, machine learning and cognitive science.

[Bohdan Khomtchouk](https://luddy.iupui.edu/contact/profile/bohdan-khomtchouk)  [Department of BioHealth Informatics](https://luddy.iupui.edu/departments/biohealth/index.html)  Khomtchouk’s mentorship already is having a substantial impact on graduates of the bioinformatics program. One of his research students from the University of Chicago, Yoon Seo Lee, is beginning her Ph.D. studies in biomedical engineering at Harvard University this fall.  Another student, Simranjit Kaur Virk (left), has worked as part of the Janga Lab with Luddy Indianapolis Associate Professor Sarath Chandra Janga . Virk is graduating this December after a successful summer of research with the Khomtchouk lab as part of the IU DataWiz Scholars Program .

That’s why we focus on it,” says Khomtchouk.  This summer, Khomtchouk was nationally recognized with a prestigious appointment to the editorial board of Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine , the American Heart Association’s flagship computational journal, and mentored several historically underrepresented minority students in the BioHealth Informatics program. Every spring, Khomtchouk teaches B556 Biological Database Management at Luddy Indianapolis and frequently invites his classroom students to join his lab after completion of the course.  [B556 Biological Database Management](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/courses/info-b556)  Last spring, student Nelson Luis Badia Garrido helped Khomtchouk write a 12,000-word scholarly teaching article on biobank design—currently under peer review at a high-impact journal—after having finished that course.  “Giving our IU students access to unique research and training opportunities, especially those leading to co-authorship and publication, is an important mission of my lab,” said Khomtchouk, “and essential for diversity, equity, and inclusion both at our university and beyond.”   ### Exciting opportunities for biomedical innovation  Khomtchouk’s students are collaborating with him in the interdisciplinary field of cardioinformatics. Through his lab’s research program they’re collecting, managing, and analyzing large amounts of data that can lead to new insights into what causes cardiac abnormalities. These include associated renal and metabolic co-morbidities such as kidney diseases or diabetes, and how to diagnose and treat these complex disorders in the precision medicine context.  Khomtchouk’s article in the June 2023 issue of the journal Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine, “Cardioinformatics Advancements in Healthcare and Biotechnology,” theorizes this type of research could one day transform public health through more personalized and improved cardiac therapies.  [“Cardioinformatics Advancements in Healthcare and Biotechnology,”](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCGEN.123.004119)  “By enabling clinicians and researchers to leverage the power of modern computing technology and big data to enhance patient care and medical knowledge,” says Khomtchouk, “cardioinformatics is essential to advancing medicine in what is currently the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.”   ### Everything is connected  Cardioinformatics focuses on the heart and vascular system and relates to personalized medicine and precision cardiology.  But it’s far more than that. “The field is an interdisciplinary constellation of other intersecting medical specialties in the broader precision medicine arena,” Khomtchouk says.  “For example, cardiovascular disease can be a result of, or a contributor to, metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes.”  Khomtchouk is a multi-principal investigator for “Molecular Genetics of Hereditary Endoplasmic Reticulum Diabetes,” a research project funded by an NIH Research Project Grant (R01) through 2026.   ### A biorepository for the future  It’s not only data that’s being collected.  “In addition, we’ve been building a new biobank of rare diabetes patients along with our R01 collaborators led by Dr. Fumihiko Urano at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis,” says Khomtchouk, “and digitizing that human health and well-being information in a biological database that we use to search for novel drug targets and understand biological mechanisms and outcomes.”  Establishing such a digital collection of biological samples at IU Indianapolis offers a valuable resource for research projects, such as those involving precision medicine, drug discovery, and DNA.  In addition, Khomtchouk notes, “Studies have often included the use of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and other advanced biostatistical and computational techniques to analyze complex biomedical datasets and develop predictive models that can inform clinical decision-making.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

I hope that, in addition to refining their impressive and growing design and development skills, they have come to think of design as a tool for thinking in addition to a tool for solving.”  [Travis Faas](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/travis-faas/)  First place went to the Sticky Lizards of Cathedral High school with their app titled “QuarantineMan,” Based on the game of hangman, this app is designed to be played by two users using one smart phone. Each user responds to a getting-to-know-you prompt such as “your favorite hobby during the pandemic” or “where do you go to school,” and then take turns guessing the answer.  The second place team, Dragon Software from Bloomington High School South, developed “nearSocial,” a social media app that allows users to only add friends who are located nearby and for just 30 minutes at a time. All comments on posts must be peer-reviewed before publishing and there are no push notifications; the goal is to create a moderated, non-addictive platform.  The third place app, created by Carmel High School’s Code Hounds connects users with communities of people with similar interests, hobbies, and passions. The “PassionSpark” app lists all groups and hobbies in user profiles.

Elmore, Ph.D.  Emeritus Associate Professor, Informatics   ### Contact  elmore@iupui.edu 317-274-4507 IT 500  [IT 500](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=535+W.+Michigan+St.+Indianapolis+IN+46202-3103)   ### Education   ### Biography  Dr. Elmore joined the faculty in 1976 to develop an academic program in communication technology. He established the curriculum and degrees, recruited the faculty and staff, and directed the program. As an extension of his work in communication, he collaborated closely with faculty in music, journalism, information science, art and other disciplines to develop the curriculum and interdisciplinary degree proposals for an applied major in new and emerging media. He became a Founding Member of the New Media faculty when the program was approved.  In 1989 Dr. Elmore moved into campus administration to lead the development of an information technology strategy for IUPUI. As part of the implementation, the central computing, media, and telecommunication support units were merged. He served as executive director of the new organization through the transition and then became associate dean of the faculties and associate vice chancellor at IUPUI. Dr. Elmore was appointed to his present position in 1997 when Indiana University created the Office of the Vice President of Information Technology to provide leadership for information technology and to extend support across all eight campuses of the institution.  As associate vice president, Dr. Elmore leads the UITS Teaching and Learning Information Technology (TLIT) Division. TLIT provides technology services to faculty, students, staff, and technology support professionals across eight campuses. Responsibilities include developing strategies and implementing plans for classroom technology, Residential IT Services, Student Technology Centers, Support Centers, and Oncourse (the online environment for teaching and learning at IU). TLIT also has responsibilities for technology support for faculty via campus based teaching and learning centers, an IT training and education program focused on the hardware and software used at the University, the telephone call centers that provide operator services to IUB, IUPUI, and the IU hospitals, and advanced technical support offered to technology professionals who provide IT services to schools and departments. Specialized services are offered in data management and digital media, which produce course materials in several media. Dr. Elmore’s division also provides leadership for many projects and initiatives that encourage the use of learning technology, including the IU workstation modernization and lifecycle replacement initiative, enterprise license software agreements, telephone service contracts, faculty incentive programs and assistance with learning outcome assessment. TLIT operates with a budget of $21 million and employs 236 full time professional and technical staff and approximately 400 part time staff. In his role as dean for information technology, Dr. Elmore is responsible for representing IUPUI IT interests in University Information Technology Services, for ensuring that services offered by other divisions meet the needs of students, faculty and staff at IUPUI, and for leading selected IT initiatives on the Indianapolis campus.

Registration is now open at www.midwesthealthgames.org.  The conference builds upon last fall’s inaugural event that attracted more than 100 researchers, clinicians, educators, IT professionals and interactive media experts nationwide.  This year’s conference looks to spark similar collaborations, interdisciplinary learning and potential business enterprises and investments that would further benefit the health games research environment and industry at IUPUI and beyond. National organizations like the Health Games Research program and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation have invested millions towards grants and funding for health games research and development.  Interactive health games constitute a trans-disciplinary field that uses popular gaming consoles, the web and mobile technologies to develop applications to encourage healthy behaviors, prevent disease, improve overall care and drive down medical costs. It is a field with significant research interest and activity in the School of Informatics and Computing, which views informatics as the cross-disciplinary bridge that makes this unique combination of computing and technology with medicine and healthcare possible.  William Ferguson, Ph.D., editor of the forthcoming journal Games for Health: Research, Development, and Clinical Applications will serve as keynote speaker. The conference will also feature invited speaker Alex Prokhorov, M.D., Ph.D., of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. Subjects to be covered at the October 28 conference will include games for smoking cessation, physical therapy, child behavioral therapy, speech impediments, asthma education and obesity prevention.  Early-bird registration is now open. Rates are $35 for professional registration and $15 for student registration until October 1.

All of these and more were featured the Luddy Indianapolis fall 2022 Capstone senior showcase and N420 projects. And the subject matter and media applications were as varied as the industry sponsors the students partnered with or interned for.  “Our community and corporate partners demand students that excel both in technical and creative capacities.  More importantly, they look to upcoming graduates to also understand and appreciate the impact and strategy their skills can have in product development, research, and content creation.”, said Zebulun Wood , co-director of the Media Arts and Science (MAS) degree program and N420 instructor. “Our projects partnerships and client collaborators needs’ mirror the ubiquity and demand for our students’ skillsets locally, nationally, and abroad.  We are always excited to partner and take on new challenges that leverage Luddy’s killer technology, facilities, and faculty expertise. Let’s create! ”  [Zebulun Wood](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/zeb-wood/)  In addition, graduate students’ projects were on display, ranging from developing a mobile app for Huntington National Bank to health informatics research for Hands in Autism.  Gary Schwebach , associate director of the Biomedical Informatics degree program and mentor for many of the Health Informatics graduate students, said, “The Capstone presentation gives our Biohealth Informatics students the opportunity to display what they have done while applying their academic studies in a working environment. This provides our partners with solid evidence of their skills that they can put to work improving the condition of their future employers. The students get the chance to shine and our partners get access to a pool of job ready candidates.”  [Gary Schwebach](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/gary-schwebach/)   ### Shall we play a game?  Would you play Nine-Tail Fox, Xeria the Last Avian, Xoria, or Alien Breakout? How about Night’s Shade, Do No Harm or Friendly Façade games?  Nine-Tail Fox, created by MAS student Yutsuki Liu is based on a Chinese folktale. Liu brought it to life in a game that invited players to capture the tails through a series of challenges. Other games involved creatures with a darker side.   ### Time for screen time  Capstone students developed and produced The Great Nugget Caper, We Are Veterans , A Moment for Love, Accessing Safe Abortion, and Quartz Quest videos.  [We Are Veterans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=oU_LCq6wPig&feature=youtu.be)  Just like on the big screen, these short documentary or animated films explored topics ranging from A to Z. Alexander Young’s 2D animation brought his original characters to life in Quartz Quest.   ### Unique and varied projects  Projects like Search and Rescue, Butterflies at the Zoo (presented by Lauren Fasig, pictured below), Illegal Wildlife Trade, Tunnels and Trolls, the State of Aging Report, and Gundam Model Kits illustrate our students’ imaginations, skills, and talents.  At the end of the evening, MAS faculty Mathew Powers emceed the Capstone Awards, celebrating all the students and the culmination of their hard work.

She worked at GEICO’s Washington, DC corporate headquarters on their Digital Experience Team as a UX/UI design/research intern. Her goal was to learn how a design team functions in industry, which she feels she achieved.  “My supervisors and mentors were really receptive and helpful in making sure I was able to get what I wanted out of the internship. I learned a lot about giving and receiving feedback effectively, and was able to learn some new tools and software. Getting some hands-on experience also gave me a better idea of what I want to look for in a full-time job,” she said.  Bougher says she prepared by working on her portfolio, preparing a list of questions, and getting assistance from others. “Pat (Rhodes) in SoIC Career Services was really helpful with editing my portfolio, resume, and cover letters. Getting feedback from other students and from people outside of the field helped as well.”  [SoIC Career Services](https://luddy.iupui.edu/careers/career-services-office/)  She advises others to connect their past experience with current experience and goals and not to rule out an opportunity too quickly based on location or industry. “I didn’t think I would be able to do an internship out of state, and I certainly didn’t initially think insurance would be my dream internship. However, it worked out; the internship ended up being a great fit.”  Bougher also encourages students to keep working on their portfolio, continue to edit, seek feedback, and make changes to that critical part of an application for a job or internship.  Steffi Gogoi has a long-term career goal of working as a UX designer to create product designs that will foster community around the globe. She interned at IDEXX Laboratories in Maine as an interaction designer on a mobile app project.  While there, Gogoi won a poster competition, which she presented to IDEXXers, including vice presidents of the company. IDEXX, like many of the companies mentioned, offered the interns activities such as learning lunches, company tours, networking opportunities, and team-building exercises.  Gogoi says, when it comes to seeking internships, “Start early, fail fast.” She recommends connecting with people who believe in your potential, ask questions, share your ideas, and believe in yourself. “You never know what you are capable of until you try!” She also suggests building a portfolio side by side with applications, rather than one after the other. Gogoi, too, worked with Rhodes on her resume and cover letter.  “I read many UX articles on Medium (website) and in UX magazine, and also looked for upcoming trends in UX design, prepared for interview questions, read company profiles, and rehearsed my introduction part before giving the interviews,” Gogoi said.  Swapnil Kosarabe is aiming to strategically solve complex design problems that can empower humans to achieve more, with his degree in HCI. He spent the summer as a UX design intern at Microsoft in Boston and says that he gained more than he ever expected, working together with 40 interns with different ideas and perspectives.  Kosarabe was able to visit the Seattle headquarters and participate in an intern signature event that helped him improve his networking. He says Microsoft arranged several interesting events that helped interns get to know each other better.  He says several factors helped him secure the internship, including feedback from faculty on design, inspiration from UX designers in user-centric organizations, following UX groups and articles that helped him learn the art of storytelling, and presenting his projects to alumni to improve his soft skills.  Kosarabe’s advice to those seeking internships like his is to “Be innovative and think outside of the box. Get inspired, but don’t imitate.” He also suggests sketching ideas, participating in whiteboard challenges, and attending conferences.  Amber Tansy interned at CBS in San Francisco, working as a UX designer in the gaming sector. She is still working for CBS part-time while she finishes her master’s degree. “CBS offered the perfect environment for me to get my feet wet in the industry, and within my field. It was the perfect position for me. Fortunately, I’m still in it now, only 2,000 miles away.”  Tansy says the best part of the experience was the people she worked with. “Everyone was a gamer, everyone was extremely laid back, friendly, personable, but hardworking. I instantly felt like I belonged when I arrived, and needless to say, they couldn’t get rid of me once the internship ended,” she joked.  She suggests not waiting too long to apply for internships; although she started in October the previous year, she says that might have been a little late. Instead start as soon as you can, as soon as positions open, she advises. And she emphasizes that applicants should not recycle their resume and cover letter for every application. “Make. Unique. Cover. Letters. Because recruiters and managers can tell the difference.” She also encourages attending university-held events like career fairs, conferences, etcetera, and finally, be confident.  Tansy reminds others to remember, “The people on the other end of the phone/video/table are not the only ones interviewing someone. You’re also interviewing THEM, so come with questions… If they answer something in a way that you dislike, you DO NOT have to work for them. A job goes two ways: an employee and employer relationship is a mutual one.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Electronic Health Records May Hold Key to Better Health Planning Within a County  October 25, 2013  IUPUI researchers received a $200,000 grant to study the feasibility of using electronic health records to measure health outcomes of Marion County residents by neighborhood or even by census block for public health planning.    The two-year study will also determine the validity of integrating those records with community health indicators such as parks, grocery stores selling fresh produce, and access to healthcare facilities, said the study’s principal investigator Brian Dixon, an assistant professor of Health Informatics in the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI. Dixon is also a research scientist at the Regenstrief Institute and the Roudebush VA Medical Center. The research team also includes other IUPUI researchers from the IU School of Medicine and Polis Center as well as epidemiologists from the Marion County Public Health Department.  The project is one of 11 that received research awards, totaling $2.7 million, facilitated by the National Network of Public Health Institutes, with guidance from the National Coordinating Center for Public Health Services and Systems Research housed at the University of Kentucky’s College of Public Health. Support for this study was provided by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.  “Current information on the health of people living in Marion County available to public health officials is based on samples representing county-wide statistics,” Dixon said. “But the increasing availability and use of electronic health records may permit public health officials to peer within the county at smaller and smaller groups of residents.” If that’s possible, public health officials could more readily determine which areas of the county are most in need of particular public health programs.  “When there is a limited budget for, say preventing diabetes, the county health department has to decide how to spend its resources,” said Dixon. “One option is to evenly divide the money across all communities within the county, some of which probably don’t have as much need as others. A second option is to identify specific areas within the county that might need intervention the most.”  “The growing use of electronic health records offers the potential to follow the second choice,” Dixon said. “Researchers will look at aggregate data for finite geographical regions within the county to measure the health of a particular neighborhood or set of neighborhoods and use that information to identify where particular public health programs or interventions are most needed.”  Researchers will analyze the electronic records of smaller and smaller groups of county residents, including by zip code (average population of 8,000), neighborhood (average population of 3,000 to 4,500) and census block (average population of 1,500), the smallest population grouping to be examined.  The first test will be to come up with health measurements at a sub-county level for information like how many people in a particular area receive flu shots. Then Dixon and other researchers will be able to take that data and link it to socio-economic factors, enabling them to tease out what determinants make one area healthier than another.  In the current era of health reform, public health transformation, and diminishing resources, practitioners and policy-makers need sound data on the most efficient and impactful approaches for improving community health, according to the National Network of Public Health Institutes. Research findings resulting from the electronic health records study and the other projects will provide relevant information to public health practitioners and policy-makers, contributing evidence that is urgently needed to improve quality, efficiency, and equity in public health practice with an ultimate goal of improving population health nationwide.

    "body": "  ## Jordan Nelsen and Rachel Palfi honored as top students at IUPUI  May 17, 2018  Two students from the IU School of Informatics and Computing, senior Jordan Nelsen, Media Arts and Science (MAS), and junior Rachel Palfi, Health Information Management (HIM), were recently recognized at the 2018 Top 100 Outstanding Students Recognition Dinner. Nelsen was also selected for the top 10 list.  The IUPUI top 100 and top 10 students are chosen by a panel of alumni, faculty and staff based on their record of scholastic achievement, campus co-curricular activities, and civic and community service. Nominees must be juniors or seniors who have completed at least 56 hours toward a degree, with a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.2.  Nelsen said of her top 10 and top 100 awards, “It would not have been possible without my family, friends, colleagues, and mentors here at IUPUI. I am eternally grateful for all that they’ve done for me.” Palfi added, “When I heard I was a top 100 student at IUPUI I was in disbelief and shock. I’m so honored and humbled to be named as one of the 2018 top 100 students.”  Nelsen, who also completed her B.F.A. from Herron School of Art and Design, is heavily involved in facial prosthetic reconstruction research. She learned of the opportunity through an MAS class in 3-D design. “I have always been extremely interested in both anatomy and art. Finding this niche that satisfies both of these interests while also being able to directly help people has been a dream come true,” Nelsen said.  For nearly the past two years, she has been collaborating with Dr. Travis Bellicchi, a resident at the IU School of Dentistry, to create facial prostheses for patients who have lost facial features due to cancer, accidents, or burns, or have lived without certain features because of congenital disorders. In that time, she has been a part of 16 patient cases, most recently digitally designing a prosthesis in less than 4 hours, which led to the team being able to fit the prosthesis on the patient and characterize it in an unprecedented delivery time of less than 24 hours.  Nelsen has also worked with esteemed neurosurgeon Dr. Aaron Cohen-Gadol as an artist completing 3-D medical visualizations for the Neurosurgical Atlas, the most trusted neurosurgery resource in the world. And she is using her skills to design surgical guides for dental implants, research better processes for creating more accurate and effective burn masks that minimize patient discomfort, and develop a pipeline for forensic facial reconstruction from unidentified human remains.  Aside from her classes at IUPUI, Nelsen has been involved with SIGGRAPH IUPUI Student Chapter, a media arts club, serving as marketing director, vice president, and president.  Palfi, who is a Cox Scholar, is involved in multiple organizations on campus—Order of Omega Greek Honor Society, Golden Key International Honor Society, Delta Zeta Sorority, and Jagathon—and participates in the IUPUI Day of Service, Martin Luther King Jr. Day of Service, Cesar Chavez Day of Service, and Jaguars in the Streets. She also volunteers her time at Second Helpings, Ronald McDonald House, Riley Hospital for Children, Keep Indianapolis Beautiful, Walk to End Alzheimer’s, Coxhall Gardens, and 500 Festival events, among others.  In addition to her co-curricular activities at IUPUI, Palfi holds two jobs on campus. “I love giving back to my community and helping others,” she said.  Both women acknowledge the valuable guidance of faculty who mentored them throughout their academic careers. “Zeb Wood has been one of the greatest mentors I could have ever asked for. He has taught me so much and has continued to motivate me to push myself to heights I never thought possible. The work that I have been able to accomplish would not be possible without him,” Nelsen said.  Wood, lecturer and co-director of the MAS program, said, “Jordan’s work embodies the true potential of all of our MAS students.  Our faculty, and students like Jordan, are polymaths; those who embrace multiple areas of study.  Jordan exemplifies the type of student we at Media Arts and Science and the School of Informatics and Computing yearn for​.”  Palfi identified professors Lisa DesNoyers and Carolyn Murry as having had a significant influence on her at the School of Informatics and Computing. “They are always there for me when I need them, and I know they both want me to succeed. Both of these women have helped me grow professionally, academically, and as a woman in the health information management field,” she said.  DesNoyers, director of the HIM program, said of Palfi, “Rachel has been a devoted student and a strong student leader, and has shown exceptional promise to the future of HIM.  I can see her as a future leader in this field.  We know that Rachel is going to be taking the world by storm.”  Nelsen’s plans post-graduation are to continue to serve the facial disfigurement community by creating facial prostheses and further the research she has already started, while simultaneously balancing her digital illustration and painting work.  Palfi is looking to stay in Indianapolis and work at a healthcare organization. Although she is not sure about the specific position she would like to have yet, she is very interested in working in data analysis, informatics, and healthcare technology.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Luddy Indianapolis alumni adjuncts: Those who can, teach at Luddy!  September 6, 2023  A number of Luddy Indianapolis graduates are still roaming the halls of the ICTC building, but this time as faculty. Mikaylah Gross Stumbo (Informatics/HCI) and Brendan Bow (Informatics/HCI) are among the adjunct instructors and lecturers who are now teaching in the classrooms, in-person or virtually, where they recently were students.   ### Understanding student expectations and perspectives  Brendan Bow  Brendan Bow earned his Bachelor of Science in Informatics in 2019 and his Master of Science in Human Computer Interaction in 2020. In addition to teaching for the Department of Library and Information Science, he is a Policy Analyst for the Center for Research on Inclusion and Social Policy, part of the IU Public Policy Institute (under O’Neill SPEA). Bow works with local nonprofits to determine if their programs are effective, as well on general policy research and policy briefs. He typically does data analysis and quantitative research on topics related to housing, homelessness, and criminal justice.  “I love the city of Indianapolis and love being able to make a difference in the community. I had a great time as a student at Luddy IUPUI and I wanted to help others along with also having a great time here. Additionally, my parents have both taught in colleges and universities and always instilled in me the importance of sharing your knowledge with others,” Bow said.  I think being an alum helps me to better understand the students’ expectations and where they’re coming from. Additionally, it helps me to better recommend resources on campus if a student needs them and to better make connections to other things that are going on in their other classes. For example, I can say things like “if you recall from your Intro to Informatics class…” or “you can use this to create neat visualizations in d3.js, which you can learn about in Dr. Reda’s class…”  Bow believes he brings a few unique perspectives to his students from being a former student. “One thing that I particularly enjoyed as a student (and I try to stress to my current students) is the idea of working across schools and departments to further one’s own education. For example, when I was a Luddy student, I worked very closely with the Herron School of Art and Design to learn how they work through the design process, and used it to inform my own design skills (for databases or elsewhere). Additionally, a great deal of my studies were in the more technical side of computing (server administration), so I try to use that to talk about why we do certain things in big data differently than small data. For example, things like the differences between the way a typical PC stores data versus the way a Hadoop (big data) database stores things,” he said.  Bow also said his work experience helps him build his curriculum by letting him contextualize the very fundamental assumptions about data. “My work is in public policy, a very data-driven field. A very significant portion of the course discusses data ethics and implications, including the idea that as data professionals we (the students and I) are responsible for making sure that our data can be understood clearly and plainly. As database designers, we are responsible for creating the contexts in which data is presented. I try to make the point that humans are fallible, and that data systems created by humans are also fallible. Trust, but verify,” Bow said.   ### Enhancing conceptual understanding with real-world examples  Mikaylah Stumbo  Mikaylah (Gross) Stumbo spends her days as a Principal Human Factors Engineer at Eli Lilly and Company in Indianapolis. She graduated with her B.S. in Informatics in 2016 and received her M.S. in Human-Computer Interaction in 2018.  Human Factors Engineering is the research and application of information about human behavior, abilities, limitations, and other characteristics to the design of a product. Specifically, within the healthcare sector, human factors engineers ensure that user interfaces are safe and effective for people to use.  Stumbo said, “My time at Lilly started within connected care development supporting the diabetes business unit. We researched digital solutions to monitor blood glucose readings and deliver insulin to patients with Type 1 diabetes, in addition to creating data visualization tools for their healthcare professionals.  “For the past three years, I’ve led the human factors research efforts on several injection device platforms used for the treatment of gastrointestinal, dermatological, and neurodegenerative conditions in children, adolescents, and adults. I contribute human factors expertise to device design, secondary packaging, and labeling materials of clinical trial and commercial products used by patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals. I also serve as a risk management technical liaison, helping other human factors engineers analyze, evaluate, control, and monitor risk that could lead to patient harm. Lastly, I complete human factors activities and deliverables that support regulatory submissions to agencies like the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA).”  Stumbo said she has always been drawn to teachers, who have served as mentors, advocates, and friends to her throughout her life. “Naturally, I wanted to serve in a similar role to younger students as I progressed through my schooling, teaching well over 1,000 K–12 students while attending Luddy Indy. When I was offered to start engaging with college students as a teaching assistant for Senior Lecturer Louie Zhu , it pushed not only my teaching skills, but also my technical abilities. The part I loved the most about teaching was watching students have the “light bulb” moment after working through a difficult assignment in class.  [Louie Zhu](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/louis-zhu/)  “Teaching collegiately turned into a bucket list item post-graduation, and I continued to engage in voluntary teaching and guest speaking opportunities, of which many were held at the alma mater. When Davide Bolchini (Professor and now Sr. Executive Dean at Luddy Indianapolis) reached out and asked if I would be interested in joining the faculty to teach, it was an offer I couldn’t refuse. What better way to stay engaged with the school than to teach alongside the teachers that taught me?,” Stumbo said.  [Davide Bolchini](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/davide-bolchini/)  She is currently teaching INFO-H 563 Psychology of Human Computer Interaction, which covers the psychological and behavioral science of human computer interaction, including cognitive architecture, memory, problem-solving, mental models, perception, action, and language. Emphasis is placed on developing an understanding of the interaction between human and machine systems and how these processes impact the design and testing of interactive technologies.  Teaching in the same school where she was a student offers a unique perspective. “For starters, I’ve taken the same exact courses that are required to complete the master’s program. It provides me a deeper level of empathy, as I know what’s expected of students, the range of knowledge they should have, and where the pain points may be.  It also allows me to pull in content from other classes students should be taking to help enhance the learnings of this course,” Stumbo said.  One area Stumbo invests extra time into is understanding each student individually—their passions, their learning styles, and any previous knowledge they have in this course, which helps instill that she sees the individuals in her course as humans first, then students. “There are many instances where life will get in the way, or course content may be too daunting, leading to more stress than necessary. I encourage students to have a collaborative relationship with me to share “wins”, struggles, or concerns. That way, we can pivot coursework or schedules around to meet the individual student’s need while also ensuring they are completing coursework to the level of satisfaction required of the master’s program.  Ironically, meeting students where they are and understanding their needs and wants is the foundation of human-centered design, a core tenant of the human-computer interaction program!  “Lastly, I take great pride in our school and the programs we offer, and I want each student to have as great of an educational experience as I did. I engage with current students by sharing career advice, talking about life outside of IUPUI or what it’s like to work in my industry, much in the same way that previous alumni did for me,” she added.  Stumbo also said that a large portion of what is taught in her class directly aligns to the responsibilities she has at her day job, which entails researching and understanding human cognitive capabilities and how that may impact product design. She said that providing relevant, real-world examples of human factors to the course through discussions or assignments enhances students conceptual understanding of foundational topics they can take into the rest of their college experience and ideally, their long-term career.     ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

Robert B. Annis, the foundation’s late founder, was an alumnus of Arsenal Technical High School. This gift will be used to fund general program expenses.  [Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce (iDEW)](https://luddy.iupui.edu/idew/)  The year-round iDEW program currently benefits four Indianapolis high schools—Providence Cristo Rey, Arsenal Technical, Pike, and Northwest. Two hundred forty students, in grades 9 through 12, are participating this year in modules that include robotics, coding, and Internet of Things. This is the third year iDEW has been operating in Indianapolis.  The IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI faculty, administration, and students work with the school principals, teachers, and academic counselors from these four selected schools to develop and implement a successful enrichment program that focuses on STEM. The learning modules are highly engaging and educational, with the primary focus of instilling interest in STEM areas, and a primary objective of advancing these students into a college education and a career in informatics.  There is a growing number of unfilled, high-paying jobs in the IT industry. The iDEW program inspires students and provides them with the skills needed to secure employment. The program also increases diversity in the IT workforce, as 80 percent of program participants are underrepresented minorities and women.  “We are highly appreciative of this gift from RB Annis Educational Foundation, and are grateful to their board of directors for recognizing the critical role iDEW serves in filling the IT workforce and for helping offer this opportunity to the youth of Indianapolis,” said Mathew Palakal , iDEW program director and executive associate dean of the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI. “Such opportunities would not be available to these students without the critical financial support and expertise from our sponsors and partners.”  [Mathew Palakal](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/mathew-palakal/)   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Ph.D. student receives Air Force grant to improve human-machine interfaces  November 7, 2017  Human-centered computing graduate student Eric Vorm recently received a $75,000 research grant from the U.S. Air Force. The award, titled “Designing for transparent automated visual classification systems,” will support Vorm in improving the human-machine team by designing interfaces that enable improved human operator awareness and facilitate explanation-based reasoning when assisted by automation, i.e., artificial intelligence or AI.  Lieutenant Vorm, a Ph.D. candidate at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, is an Aerospace Experimental Psychologist on active duty with the U.S. Navy. He has a background in aerospace and mechanical engineering and experimental psychology, and served with the Marine Corps in Iraq.  Davide Bolchini , chair of the Department of Human-Centered Computing, said, “We are very proud of this prestigious grant that Eric received. His research is very timely—and broadly applicable to everyday digital products that promise higher autonomy and intelligence in supporting users.” Vorm’s thesis advisor, Andrew Miller , assistant professor of Human-Computer Interaction, added, “This project, and Eric’s dissertation as a whole, exemplifies our school’s commitment to applied, interdisciplinary, human-centered research. I’m excited to continue to work with Eric to improve transparency in human-machine interaction.”  [Davide Bolchini](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/davide-bolchini/)  [Andrew Miller](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/andrew-miller/)  According to Vorm, today’s military intelligence analysts must monitor and search through vast amounts of complex visual data for hours on end in order to identify and classify potential threats to the US and our allies. Automated visual classification systems can assist in these tasks by processing vast amounts of visual data and alerting operators when the computer finds something of interest.  Sometimes, however, the data computers must work with is incomplete, and visual classification systems employing deep learning neural networks are still prone to misidentification. These limitations often result in errors and false alarms, which the operator must be able to detect in order to ensure system integrity and mission performance goals are met. In periods of high stress and limited time, however, studies have shown that humans often fail to detect these kinds of errors, and often defer to the system’s recommendations, even when those recommendations are incorrect.  “It all comes down to decision making,” Vorm said. “Humans are great at using a combination of logic and intuition to figure things out, but their decisions are only as good as the information they have to work with. We need to make sure that that information is provided in the right format at the right time to support the operator’s ability to reason and handle challenging events. That is what designing for ideal human-computer interaction is all about.”  Vorm’s research, which begins this fall and will be run at the Air Force’s Human Performance Wing at Wright-Patterson Air Force base, seeks to evaluate and develop interface designs and provide design guidelines for how to achieve appropriate automation transparency to support decision making in complex and time-sensitive conditions. According to Vorm, this research will be useful in improving a variety of civilian technologies as well, from healthcare applications like robot-assisted surgery and AI-assisted diagnoses, to AI-based financial trading, and self-driving cars.  “Our future work environments will be increasingly supported by artificial intelligence, which will continue to assume larger roles in our daily lives. In order for this human-machine team to work,” Vorm said, “we must make sure that both the human and computer communicate effectively with one another. This research is just a small step toward achieving that vision.”     ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

These technologies may become viable alternatives for other users as well.  “The goal of this project is to rethink our understanding of interacting with text from a screen-centric paradigm to screenless, aural environments.”  Davide Bolchini, chair, Department of Human-Centered Computing  “We live in a screen-centric world that captures most of our daily attention. This often conceals from us the possibility of realizing what our experience with information technology would look like without visual displays,” Bolchini says.  Building on over a decade of research in accessible computing—especially to understand how people who are blind may aurally navigate interactive systems like the web—Bolchini sees this project as the next step in an organic continuum of research exploring the design space of entirely auditory human-text interaction.  “We take for granted that visual displays are the only medium for experiencing information-rich, interactive applications,” he says.  “But this paradigm is very limiting.  “Typing, for example, is an activity that relies upon on-screen keyboards that still display characters visually. This presents a barrier for people who are blind—as well as for all users in situations where it is inconvenient or unsafe to hold a phone at all times to communicate.”  An exciting aspect of this work is studying the implications of transferring text-centric technology—such as the keyboard—from the visual-spatial dimension to one that is entirely temporal. It’s a delicate give-and-take proposition.  Bolchini’s research investigates how to free ourselves from screens and keypads, possibly using armbands or other wearable accessories. “A major unsolved challenge is how to manipulate text aurally and silently, in situations when voice input fails or breaks privacy boundaries,” he says. “This will allow us to unbind users from a visual display both for input and output, and experience auditory flows of information controllable by a suitable form of nimble, wearable input.”  “This research is expected to inform future technologies that can augment the ability of over 7 million blind people in the United States to perform text entry,” Bolchini says, “circumventing direct interaction with screen-based devices.”  Community partnership is an important part of human-centered computing research. Obtaining input from people who have trouble with screen-based prompts is essential to this project.  By leveraging prior studies he’s led on aural interfaces, Bolchini’s research will continue to engage people who are blind and visually impaired—from the Indiana School for the Blind, Bosma Enterprises, and Easterseals Crossroads—as well as IU students from underrepresented groups. Participants will co-create and evaluate new options to interact with text while bypassing the screen.  “My hope is that the project will contribute to shifting the way people think about accessible typing in eyes-free scenarios.”  Davide Bolchini  Bolchini’s latest research project will explore technology that moves with the user, and how to interact with devices via sound.  “The conceptual advances will be designed to work with current and future wearable input devices (hand/finger gestures supported by armband or smart rings),” he says, “and will inform the foundation for a new class of auditory keyboards untethered to a visual display.”  The project later will include evaluation studies with sighted and blind participants on system prototypes of auditory keyboards, to examine how people can aurally manipulate text.  These observations will prove invaluable in understanding how we may one day navigate a screenless environment to manipulate text, performing entirely aural typing, editing, and text browsing.   ### Acknowledgment  This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1909845.

    "body": "  ## School of Informatics and Computing Faculty to be Recognized at International Conference on Computer Games  July 18, 2013  Dr. Joseph Defazio, professor of Media Arts and Science, associate lecturer, Travis Fass, along with Rebecca Finch, doctoral student in the Human-Computer Interaction program, from the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, authored a paper which was recently accepted to the 18th annual International Conference on Computer Games, CGAMES.  The paper titled, Building Multi-User Virtual Worlds, explores virtual worlds and their usefulness and practicality in educating students. The focus of the paper is design and development of an academic course on the topic of multi-user virtual worlds. The paper serves as a blue print set of instructions for the creation of a multi-player virtual game where students interact with one another in either real-time or through a series of simulated events.  Using virtual environments as an educational tool is a relatively new concept and one that could provide significant insight into new ways of teaching. “We have yet to realize the full potential of multi-user virtual worlds and augmented reality experiences in cross-disciplinary educational opportunities, “said Prof. Defazio.  This year’s CGAMES conference will take place over the course of four days, July 29th to August 1st, in Louisville, Kentucky. The conference will feature keynote addresses from experts in areas pertaining to computer game research, workshops on the latest breakthroughs in computer technology, and academic paper presentations.

    "body": "  ## Librarian Helps Snag $7 Million Federal STEM Grant for Indiana High School  January 26, 2015  At Pike High School in Indianapolis, IN, school librarian Chad Heck is playing a significant role in a $7 million grant which is set to transform the grade 9–12 campus—and the way the school library is perceived by the district.  “The library program has gotten a lot more respect from the administration,” says Heck. “They didn’t understand our role as curriculum and tech leaders.”  But after Heck helped co-write the U.S. Department of Labor Youth CareerConnect (YCC) Grant, his role, and that of ninth-grade librarian Lena Darnay, has changed dramatically. For starters, the school learned they’d won the grant in March 2014 and was expected to have many pieces in play by last summer. Those elements included professional development classes for staff as they adopted a new digital curriculum.  Twelve teachers began working with Heck for two weeks this summer toward developing inquiry projects for students, many of whom are being taught research skills this year, from how to phrase a search query to how to access information in databases. Teachers are also learning how to integrate more tech tools into classroom lessons—for example, outfitting  students’ cell phones with polling software.  “We’re infusing information literacy throughout,” says Heck, a former classroom teacher who taught STEM-based classes himself, though not in the Metropolitan School District (MSD) of Pike Township, where Pike High is located. “There are inquiry projects, as well as face-to-face classes. I’m helping the teachers design those lessons and also co-teaching research skills.”  The YCC Grant, launched in 2013 and funded by the Department of Labor, will focus the school’s move toward becoming a STEM-focused campus. Students now have four STEM paths they can follow. Similar to a major, the paths include engineering, biomedical/health science, information technology, and advanced manufacturing and logistics. There are also internships available with regional companies, including Eli Lilly and Rolls Royce.  Students are expected to commit to two years of the program, and 500 enrolled this fall. The school anticipates enrolling another 250 for the 2015–2016 school year, and interest has already exceeded availability.  “It’s going to have to be much more competitive to sign up,” says Kathy Sharpe, program manager for Pike High’s YCC program. “We may have to allow first-come, first-serve or have an application process.”  School laptops are on order, part of the Pike’s plan to become a 1:1 campus. That equipment was funded by the grant, which also enabled the school to hire a technology integrator. That’s been a tremendous help to Heck, who has a full plate providing library services and helping with tutorials and other technology lessons for science teachers and students alike.  In his eighth year in the district, including four years as Pike High School’s librarian, Heck doesn’t understand the meaning of downtime. He’s also completing his last year of law school, attending classes at night. But the grant and the related new opportunities has renewed his passion for school libraries, information literacy, and his school.  “I don’t think I want to practice law,” says Heck. “I think I want to stick with the library thing.”  Chad is a 2012 graduate of the Library and Information Science program at IUPUI.

The program, known as ITEC, began in spring 2011 as a pilot project and has grown through the years. The students have different skills, interests and backgrounds; they collaborate under a faculty member’s guidance to learn about research commercialization and to develop entrepreneurial and business skills. It is part of the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Innovation-to-Enterprise Central.  Team leader Kevin Berkopes, executive director of the Mathematics Assistance Center and Statistics Assistance Center, believes ITEC is transformative for students, schools and the campus. This is his second ITEC team; his current group includes students from the Herron School of Art and Design, the IU School of Informatics and Computing, and the Purdue School of Science, working together to develop a database-driven, customizable mobile app. Berkopes also teams with faculty members Zeb Wood from informatics and Brad McKinney from Herron.

    "body": "  ## IUPUI researcher develops new technologies and methods for mapping RNA  January 28, 2020  Sarath Chandra Janga , associate professor of bioinformatics and data science in the Department of BioHealth Informatics at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, was awarded a $299,698 NSF Early-Concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) grant. EAGER funding is used to support exploratory work in its early stages on untested, but potentially transformative, research ideas or approaches.  [Sarath Chandra Janga](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/sarath-janga/)  Janga’s project, “EAGER: Algorithmic frameworks and resources for mapping RNA modifications from single molecule direct RNA-sequencing data,” will enable discovery of all the messenger RNA molecules expressed from the genes of an organism and the code that allow RNA and related proteins to operate in real time at a single-molecule resolution. Little is known about the molecular players that are involved in the numerous steps that govern expression patterns, including localization, splicing, stability, and folded structure of the RNA.  Ribonucleic acid, or RNA, is one of the three major biological macromolecules essential for all known forms of life. A central tenet of molecular biology states that the flow of genetic information in a cell is from DNA through RNA to proteins: “DNA makes RNA makes protein”.  Janga and his lab propose to detect, identify, and quantify RNA modifications using the Oxford Nanopore platform, and results will be analyzed for robustness in precision and accuracy. Experiments will utilize synthetic calibration as well as newly-developed algorithms.  Janga is also Co-PI on a Software Hardware Foundation (SHF) grant awarded in tandem by the National Science Foundation, titled “Automated Algorithm/Hardware Co-design for Accelerating Nanopore Base-calling,” with Principal Investigator Lei Jiang , assistant professor in the IUB department of Intelligent Systems Engineering.  [Lei Jiang](https://luddy.indiana.edu/contact/profile/?profile_id=453)  Significantly, nanopore genome sequencing is becoming the cornerstone to enabling personalized medicine, global food security, and wildlife conservation, says Janga. “Base-calling,” the process of assigning bases to signal peaks generated by the gene sequencer, is time consuming. Although current approaches reduce computing overhead, they increase systematic errors, which results in lower accuracy in base-calling. Jiang and Janga propose to develop a novel algorithm and hardware co-design methodology to make base-calling more power efficient, scalable, and accessible.  Janga says that improvements to nanopore base-calling at both at the DNA and RNA levels, supported by these two grants from the NSF, “could offer on-demand rapid genome and transcriptome sequencing solutions, thus making real-time, in-home diagnostic tool kits for several infectious and complex diseases a reality.” He believes that overcoming base-calling limitations of the current computational frameworks — coupled with developments in nanopore sequencing — would pave the path for day-to-day use of sequencing technology to realize the dream of in-home clinical care in the 21st century.   ### Acknowledgement  This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1940422 and Grant No. 1908992 .

The 2010 Master of Library Science graduate is an inspiration to those she serves as community branch manager of the East 38th Street Indianapolis Public Library—and to everyone who has seen her transform her life, the lives of her patrons, and the future of libraries.  There were roadblocks in Heyward’s path to graduate school at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI. A teen mother who grew up in Indianapolis, Heyward was determined to be the first in her family to go to college—for the sake of her daughter Shanequia Gill, and to honor her beloved late grandmother Alice Kennedy, who took Heyward to the library regularly during her childhood.  “Libraries help revitalize struggling and depressed communities,” says Heyward, whose dozens of pioneering, philanthropic library projects—such as a food program for children, GED classes, Breakfast with a Cop, and a day care story time that focuses on STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) subjects—put her in an elite class of professionals who have earned the Library Journal honor.  Hayward’s dynamic leadership exemplifies the type of professional the program aims to develop. “My professors, mentors, and support team at the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI gave me the confidence and competencies to be successful, innovative, and resourceful in our knowledge-based society,” says Heyward, who considers completing her master’s degree in library and information science one of her greatest achievements.  All who know and love “Sister Shanika” benefit from her greatest achievement—supporting Indianapolis children and adults who have limited resources and opportunities. “Librarians are change agents,” Heyward says, “improving the quality of life for the people we serve.”  Photo by Paul Best   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Health informatics intern facilitates data-driven policy for the State of Indiana  September 28, 2022  As Palak Rajauria completes her final semester of the master’s program in Health Informatics and preparing to graduate in December 2022, she is reflecting on her internship at the Indiana Management Performance Hub (MPH), where she is a Data Science Intern. MPH is a State of Indiana agency that provides analytics solutions tailored to address complex management and policy questions enabling improved outcomes for Hoosiers and empowers their partners to leverage data in innovative ways, facilitating data-driven decision making and data-informed policy making.  [Health Informatics](https://luddy.iupui.edu/biohealth/graduate/health-informatics/masters/)  [Indiana Management Performance Hub](https://www.in.gov/mph/)  Rajauria’s work as a data scientist includes testing and evaluating data solutions as it relates to upgrades to existing software. She mines and analyzes data from state databases to drive insights into problems and efficiencies in processes while maintaining the standards of organizational excellence and engages with business stakeholders on projects and initiatives to understand their analytical and operational challenges and translate these needs into data solutions. As an intern, Rajauria spends at least 50 percent of her time on predetermined projects that enhance college-level skills and abilities.  “This internship provided me the opportunity to participate in cohort activities on a weekly basis designed to enable professional growth and preparedness for the workforce upon graduation, exposure to many facets of state government, and networking and camaraderie development among the cohort,” she says.  Rajauria chose the health informatics program at the School of Informatics and Computing (SoIC) because it offers a wide-ranging set of courses along with the flexibility to cement a robust technical foundation. What’s more, she says, SoIC boasts a perfect academic atmosphere courtesy of its expert faculty and modern infrastructure. “With a multi-ethnic student community, SoIC provides a global outlook for developing my overall personality. The courses and the electives that I chose helped in successfully accomplishing my summer internship at the State of Indiana,” she says.  She applied to various internship positions on LinkedIn, Glassdoor and Indeed and got this internship on the workforindiana.gov website where they released several governor summer intern positions. She thinks she was lucky that she applied to this position on the second day of release, although, she heard back in around a month with a screening followed by the interview.  After graduating, Rajauria would like to work full-time as a Healthcare Data Scientist/ Data Analyst in a non-profit organization. As an intern, she realized the vital role that state employees plays in addressing pressing issues of the state and improving the lives of the population through their work.  Her advice to other students is that the process of applying for an internship will be strenuous and exhausting especially when waking up to rejections every morning. But the key is to always stay positive, believe in yourself and be consistent in applying to your dream internships.  “I’d like to thank my professors from S0IC especially Professor Gary Schwebach who has always motivated me throughout this process,” Rajauria says. “I’d also like to thank the State Personnel Department for presenting me the ‘Intern of the Week’ title for my work at MPH and providing all interns the opportunity to interact with other state agencies. This internship is special to me as I had the chance to meet the Governor, Eric Holcomb, and interact with him for a few minutes.”  [Gary Schwebach](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/gary-schwebach/)   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Award-winning student creating game for kids with diabetes  February 2, 2016  “It’s surreal. I can’t believe it,” says Jacqueline Hill. The IUPUI Diversity Research Scholar and junior in the Media Arts and Science program at the IU School of Informatics and Computing is this year’s recipient of the Joseph T. Taylor Academic Achievement Award, which was given to her at the 2016 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Celebration Dinner. “I was shocked, and really honored,” she says.  Helping children cope with their health issues is not something Jacqueline Hill ever expected she’d do. But a research mentorship opportunity through the Diversity Research Scholar Program paired her in her freshman year with School of Informatics and Computing Professor Joseph Defazio and his research team, who are looking at innovative ways to improve “serious” games in health education.  What makes the games serious? They aren’t games for gaming’s sake, but have a critical purpose—in this case, helping adolescents who have diabetes manage the disease more efficiently. The diabetes game, which has a Vikings theme, is the first children’s health education game that tells a story.  Players ride on Viking ships to collect specific types of food that help manage diet and blood sugar. As a bonus, they pick up lessons about the history of Vikings on the journey. This pioneering storytelling approach, which draws on initial work from School of Informatics and Computing Professor Josette Jones and her Ph.D. students, will be a model for developing health education games of its kind in the future.  A Pixar fan who loved playing Nintendo with her grandmother, Hill knew from a young age she wanted to create something that other kids could enjoy or play. And she is happy to be applying that childhood dream toward a higher purpose.  “A lot of people at research conferences don’t know about health education games,” says Hill. Last year, she visited a local high school, where students were also surprised to learn about her work. “It was eye-opening for them to learn that games aren’t just for gaming.”  An integral member of the research team, Hill worked with Defazio to co-author an article that has been submitted to an international research journal. “He’s a wonderful person to work with—so understanding and appreciative,” she says. Hill and Defazio presented the work at the annual IUPUI Research Day in April 2015—impressive achievements for an undergraduate researcher, whom Defazio calls “absolutely great.”  “When I encounter a student who has that enthusiasm, energy, respect, and thirst for knowledge, that is the ideal,” Defazio says. “What can I say? She is the exemplar.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

[Ayoung Yoon](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/ayoung-yoon/)  [Devan Donaldson](https://www.sice.indiana.edu/faculty-research/directory/profile.html?profile_id=370)  Yoon and Donaldson, co-principal investigators, received $49,773 for their project, “Library Capacity Assessment and Development for Big Data Curation.”  The goal of the project is to develop a conceptual framework for assessing libraries’ capacity for big data curation. Assessing capacity is a critical tool for planning, monitoring, and evaluating programs prior to defining outcomes or launching curation. From their findings, the team hopes to provide a foundation for developing a toolkit for academic and public libraries. Both types of libraries are increasingly facing challenges regarding big data and are expected to help preserve and provide access to these data.  Yoon has conducted research analyzing academic libraries’ data services and found a huge gap among them in terms of types and levels of services offered. “The aid of a framework and shared practices will be invaluable to these libraries,” Yoon said. She believes librarians need to take a more active role in making big data more useful, visible, and accessible. Building sustainable and scalable data curation programs in libraries will effectively support communities and scholarship that may be overwhelmed by big data.  In order to develop a framework, the team will begin by performing a systematic review of the literature on organizational capacity, data curation, and big data practices; a large-scale, online survey of libraries; and in-person focus groups. Donaldson’s prior experience with focus groups and surveys will help the team understand the perceptions and perspectives of various stakeholders. “Our research will provide academic and public libraries with a reference point when considering whether they are up to the challenge of curating big data,” said Donaldson.  Providing an assessment method is timely because many libraries have recently launched or plan to launch new data programs.  Andrea Copeland , chair of the Department of Library and Information Science, said, “Increasingly, communities look to their libraries for leadership in areas of technology, information, and legal and ethical issues coverage. The research proposed by Yoon and Donaldson will help libraries lead the way once again, this time in data management.”  [Andrea Copeland](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/andrea-copeland/)   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Cafaro receives NSF EAGER grant to study how causation and correlation are learned  August 30, 2018  Francesco Cafaro, assistant professor of informatics in the Department of Human-Centered Computing at the Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, was recently awarded a $299,879 NSF EAGER grant for his research, “Aiding Reasoning About Correlation and Causation.”  The EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) supports exploratory projects that are in early stages and that “involve different approaches, apply new expertise, or engage novel disciplinary or interdisciplinary perspectives,” according to the NSF website.  Cafaro’s project will be conducted at Discovery Place, a science museum in Charlotte, NC, and will investigate how cognition theories can be used in designing interactive installations that improve people’s understanding of causation and correlation while exploring displayed data sets. The goal is to develop bridges between cognition, human-computer interaction, and long-term learning of STEM concepts found in the museum’s exhibits. The findings will inform the design of novel, tangible, and natural user interfaces for informal learning.  Three of Cafaro’s research assistants, Swati Mishra, Milka Trajkova, and Disha Bora, contributed to preliminary activities conducted over the summer and fall of 2017, in preparation for the grant work. Trajkova will continue this fall.  Davide Bolchini, chair of the Department of Human-Centered Computing, said, “We are very excited to see this project funded by the NSF. Such exploratory work exemplifies the foundational research that uniquely combines complementary disciplines—from embodied cognition to design science—to drive ‘high-risk/high-pay off’ research activities with great discovery potential. The interactive installation developed by Professor Cafaro and his students in Charlotte is an ideal living lab to bring to life and evaluate the ideas explored in this EAGER project.”  Causation and correlation are often confused, leading people to assume causality when there is none, although correlation can offer hints at causality. A simple example is the strong correlation between ice cream sales and number of drownings—both increase during the summer, but one does not cause the other.  The project will be conducted in four phases. In phase one, visitors will interact—using full-body or tangible interaction styles—with a visualization of geo-referenced datasets on a projected screen. The two different interaction styles are thought to prime people to use alternate mental patterns to reason about causation and correlation.  In phase two, the research team will experiment with different data visualizations—line charts or heat maps, for example—and in the third phase, visitors will personalize the displayed dataset. In the final phase, visitors will be asked to evaluate data-based claims several weeks or months after their visit in order to evaluate transferability of learning across time and to other contexts, such as a science article.  “This multidisciplinary work fundamentally cuts across the areas of cyberlearning and human-computer interaction. If successful, it will allow designers to craft interactive installations in which the ‘interaction’ facilitates people’s comprehension of what they see on the screen,” Cafaro said.

In the past, these would have been trained as separate entities—much like a self-driving car and driver—rather than learning and training together at the same time.  “We want to enable the synergy in a way that it does no patient harm and reduces burden on radiologists.”  Saptarshi Purkayastha, Dept. of BioHealth Informatics  The group has recruited 36 radiologists, ranging from first-year resident to highly experienced, and will conduct the study at Emory. Purkayastha will perform the Electronic Health Record software tooling and Danish will evaluate the learning. Participants will view over 1600 images over two 6-month phases, and gains on tasks will be measured for groups with and without the assemblage training.  One of the top priorities at the NSF is to discover how human work will change with the introduction of AI. The results of this study may point to how people and AI can work better on any cognitive task when they are treated as one unit. “Most people believe that the future of radiology work will be augmented with artificial intelligence in some way, but we want to enable the synergy in a way that it does no patient harm and reduces burden on radiologists,” says Purkayastha.   ### Acknowledgements  This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1928481 .  Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation.​  [Grant No. 1928481](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1928481&HistoricalAwards=false)  This grant builds on the work performed as part of a STEM Education and Research Institute (SEIRI) Seed Grant from 2017-2019.

    "body": "  ## Library and Information Science Internships  LIS Internships allow students in the master’s and specialist degree programs to work in real world settings, guided by knowledgeable, experienced, and successful supervisors. Internships help in exploring career options and provide potential employers a valuable perspective on a student’s interests and experience.  S605 – Internship in Information Library Services is offered for variable credit. Each academic credit hour requires 60 hours of onsite work. Normally, the graduate student does not begin the internship until he or she has completed 18 LIS graduate credit hours. Specific skills or courses required for an internship are listed in the descriptions. MLS students may register for 2 or 3 credits; students in dual or specialist programs may complete up to 6 credits with advisor approval.  [Register for internship credit](https://iupuisoic-fireform.eas.iu.edu/online/form/index/s605)   ### Internship Guidelines   #### Purpose  An internship is an opportunity for a student to gain practice in a real world setting under the guidance of a knowledgeable, experienced, and successful supervisor. The internship can be established in any setting in which information is gathered, stored, managed, retrieved, and disseminated.  Normally, the internship is completed by the student for the purpose of earning academic credit only. In some cases, however, as long as the requirements for academic credit are established as a portion of the overall internship experience, students may receive payment for their work.   #### Statement to Potential Internship Sponsors  Profit and not-for-profit institutions are encouraged to seek placement of a graduate student from the Department of Library and Information Science at IUPUI in the position of intern. Students who have skills in various areas of information organization, acquisition, preservation, service, and presentation are available to work on specific projects in order to gain valuable experience in the application of such skills prior to entering a professional career.   #### Time Frames  1. Normally, the internship is for one semester, approximately 16 weeks. The fall semester usually begins the last week of August and runs through the second week in December. The spring semester usually begins the second week in January and runs through the first week in May. The summer term usually begins the second week in May and runs through the second week in August.  2. The internship is a part-time position and should not exceed 20 hours per week. Normally, the internships should be equal to 8 to 12 hours of on-task activity each week of the semester. Actual schedules, however, are determined by mutual agreement between the supervisor and intern.  3. Normally, a LIS student completes no more than one internship during his or her graduate study at IUPUI. The internship is optional and is not required in order to complete the requirements for the master’s degree from LIS. Students in a dual master’s degree program may complete up to six credits. Students in the Specialist degree program may complete up to six credits. Normally, an internship placement should be for three credits during a given semester.  4. Normally, an institution does not employ the same intern for more than one semester. This allows a greater number of students to gain the experience and does not commit the institution to long-range employment obligations. Institutions are encouraged to provide internships on an ongoing basis.  5. Interns should be interviewed by prospective employers at least one month prior to the start of the internship. Placements will be determined no less than one week prior to the beginning of the semester of the experience.   #### Compensation  A salary for the intern is not required (but encouraged)  1. The paid intern should be compensated for his or her work at least 25% above the minimum wage level. Interns are not expected to receive benefits.  2. Normally, the intern is paid on a bi-weekly basis.  3. Individuals who agree to supervise an intern will not receive any form of compensation for such service from Indiana University, IUPUI, the School of Informatics and Computing or the Department of Library and Information Science.   #### Intern Job Descriptions  1. Institutions interested in providing an internship on a regular basis should negotiate a written job description with LIS (through the office of the Director of Admissions or the Coordinator). This description should include specific tasks to be performed, expected entry level skills, normal scheduled hours, supervisor’s name and position, and location of the internship.  2. Job descriptions may be revised to meet various skills of individual interns and demands of the institution, but specific tasks must be agreed on before an intern is placed.  3. Interns are expected to meet reasonable dress code and time schedule requirements as determined by the institution.  4. Institutions may release an intern before the end of a semester’s experience, or an intern may terminate the position with an institution before the end of the semester. In either case, due process will include first establishing a conference among the intern, the supervisor, and the coordinator of internships for LIS. Resolution of problems should come from this meeting, but should the problems continue in the opinion of any of the parties involved, the internship can be terminated.  5. Typical areas of responsibility for interns include (under the guidance of an on-site supervisor):   #### Supervision  1. The employing institution is expected to provide a supervisor for the intern. Supervisors normally hold an advanced degree and have several years of successful experience in their professional positions.  2. The supervisor is expected to determine the role of the intern and the specific tasks to be accomplished. The supervisor is expected to furnish a written evaluation of the intern at the end of the semester. The supervisor should contact the SLIS coordinator of internships if problems arise with the intern’s placement.   #### Academic Guidelines: Elements Required for Credit  Any internship, salaried or non-salaried, may be completed for academic credit provided the student is engaged in a variety of high-level tasks. In no case should the student complete an internship under the supervision of an individual who is employed at the same institution as the student. For example, if a student is employed as a teacher in an Indiana school corporation, that student is to complete the internship experience in an environment outside that in which he or she is employed. It is considered a conflict of interest for the supervisor to be a co-employee with the intern.  The opportunity to complete an internship for credit is not required for the master’s degree. LIS does not guarantee placement, but each student is encouraged to seek an internship if this experience is potentially valuable in meeting the student’s career goals.  For certification / licensure as a school media specialist (school librarian) a special type of internship is required. Please contact Kym Kramer ( kakramer@iupui.edu ) for information.   #### Common Requirements for Academic Credit  Academic credit is granted for those internships that include the opportunity for the student to experience, as nearly as possible, the professional role of the supervisor. The student should take an active part in such activities as program planning, task analysis, program implementation, direct contact information users, attending meetings or training sessions, recommending options, and evaluating decisions. It is expected that the student will work independently or with minimal supervision during a substantial portion of the internship.  The student intern will document the experience in a written journal. As a part of the journal, the intern will select and annotate one relevant document for every 20 hours of on-site work. Documents may include research or trade/professional journal articles, policy manuals, and electronic sources. Supervisors may assign or guide interns in selection of documents.   #### Role of the Student  The student should raise the potential for an internship with his or her academic adviser early in the planning stages for the graduate program of courses leading to the master’s degree or certification. Although the internship comes at the final stages of the student’s academic program, course work which will best prepare the student for an internship should be determined and completed in the academic program.  A student may explore the potential for internship placement at a specific site and discuss the possibilities with a potential supervisor. There should be no commitments made however until the internship has been negotiated by the coordinator.  During the first few weeks of the semester prior to the internship the student should contact the coordinator to discuss options for the placement. Application should be completed before mid-term of the semester prior to the expected internship experience. In most cases, supervisors will require that the student make an appointment to interview for the internship. Just as the coordinator may deny placement, a supervisor has the right to decline serving as a mentor for a student and the student may decline an offered internship placement. The goal is to secure an environment that will provide a quality internship experience for all parties involved.   #### Role of the Student’s Adviser  It is important for the student’s adviser to give guidance and recommendation as to when and where the internship should take place. The adviser is expected to help judge the adequacy of the student’s academic and skill background for the internship. Normally, at least 18 credits should be completed prior to the internship. Those courses which are core or required for the masters degree should be completed at a grade point average of B or better. Courses which are directly relevant to the internship should also be completed. Thus, it is normal that the student enroll in the internship experience during his or her final semester.  The internship is intended to provide some practical application of skills, and also for students to come as close as possible to “entry level” experiences for positions similar to that held by the supervisor. The internship should involve a wide variety of tasks, problems, opportunities, observations, and challenges. It is never to be a clerical or a routine experience. A special project may be established by the supervisor which may consume a great deal of the student’s time, but this one project should not comprise the entire internship experience.  In most cases, the student will be expected to have completed at least 18 graduate hours toward either the MLS or the MIS prior to entering an internship. Students may be expected to have completed several specific courses relevant to the internship prior to beginning their duties.   #### Role of the Internship Coordinator  The coordinator makes final placement and confirmation. The coordinator may visit any intern on site and is responsible for gathering information (student journal and supervisor’s evaluation) for granting credit. The coordinator convenes meeting(s) of all interns at the end of the semester to report on their experiences.   #### Role of the On-site Supervisor  The supervisor assigns, monitors and evaluates tasks and projects. Following completion of the internship, the supervisor completes an evaluation and recommends whether the intern deserves credit for the course.   ### Timeline for Internships  This timeline links to explanations, forms, and other resources the intern and supervisor will need.   #### Early in your LIS Program  Discuss internship possibilities with your academic advisor, to plan the course work which will prepare you for the kind of placement you seek   #### Two Semesters Before Your Internship   #### The Semester Before Internship   #### Start of Internship Semester   #### Midway Through Internship Semester  Intern e-mails progress report to internship coordinator   #### Last Week of Internship Semester  Intern submits journal and literature reports   #### End of Internship Semester "

    "body": "  ## Ann Chenoweth Alumni Spotlight  August 21, 2018  Ann Chenoweth (Medical Records, ’80) has seen an uncommon amount of success in the field of Health Information Management , having held numerous leadership positions with the multinational 3M Company, including her current position overseeing its Health Information System’s industry relations. She is also Past President and Chair of the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA), the national organization that supports health information professionals with certifications, training, and education. But for Chenoweth, working in the health information field is in and of itself the fulfillment of a lifelong dream.  “I made the decision when I was 14 years old that I wanted to pursue a career in health information management,” Chenoweth remembers. “The mother of a classmate was the assistant director of health information management at a hometown hospital and she was extremely generous with her time – allowing me to shadow her after school. I was soon hooked. I found that the profession was a perfect combination of healthcare and business management and I’ve never regretted this decision.”  At IUPUI, Chenoweth found the perfect environment to nurture her passion. “The health information program at IUPUI had an excellent reputation with employers in the marketplace. Consequently, program graduates were actively pursued by employers and I was fortunate to have three job offers before graduating.”  Chenoweth believes the program at IUPUI was excellent preparation for a career in the health information field. “For HIM professionals, the professional practice experience (PPE) is an important part of student education and is a catalyst toward career development. It certainly was for me. By working in hospitals with such professionals, I learned a great deal about the various health information functions in both a large, complex, and often chaotic tertiary teaching environment as well as in a small rural facility. I was able to develop my leadership and communication skills and these opportunities certainly contributed to my readiness as a new HIM graduate entering the field. Within a few weeks of my PPE, I moved to Chicago to start my new job as a manager in the health information management department at Cook County Hospital.”  Chenoweth was hired at 3M in 2001, where she ran a recently acquired $25 million business. She revamped and increased its operating income from $4 million to $10 million in one fiscal year. She also led the redesign of the flagship health information coding solution utilized by 80% of the hospitals in the United States that increased revenue by $17 million over three years, which led to her current position as Senior Director of Industry Relations for 3M Health Information Services. “I was selected by the president of 3M HIS to lead this new initiative to expand 3M’s brand and enhance 3M thought leadership throughout the healthcare industry,” says Chenoweth. “I am also responsible for identifying and executing market research for the 3M strategic plan and other corporate initiatives.”  Chenoweth sees health information management professionals as having an even more vital role in the future of the healthcare field. “Big data is exploding. Exponential leaps are being made in advanced analytics—resulting in a rapid transformation on how physicians and hospitals treat patients and track diseases. Every day, new sensors and wearables are being created, enabling patients to share clinical information real-time with their providers. Enthusiasm for telemedicine continues to grow. It is an incredible time to work in this field because health information is at the heart of this transformation. But health information management professionals understand information governance and data management.  We understand coding, analytics, privacy, and quality. We understand reimbursement. We understand how to optimize clinical documentation in the electronic health record.  And it is only with this knowledge that our industry can reward value, lower cost, and make the healthcare experience better for the patients our organizations serve.”  When asked what advice she could give our current HIM students, Chenoweth said the following: “The healthcare industry will continue to change rapidly and to succeed in the health information management profession, we must be open minded, flexible, and willing to go beyond the responsibilities of our current job descriptions, so never say “that’s not my job and never shrink from an opportunity-but instead go over and above, which is the path I chose. Going beyond our traditional boundaries creates opportunities for all of us.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

Librarians should reflect the communities they serve. However, with the well-documented lack of diversity within the library profession, this isn’t always possible. The new Wilma Gibbs Moore Graduate Endowed Scholarship will provide support to students from underrepresented backgrounds to attend the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering to pursue a degree in library and information science.  By establishing the scholarship to memorialize her work, the Department of Library and Information Science is helping to continue the legacy of Moore, who graduated from Crispus Attucks High School and received her B.S. in sociology and her master’s in library science (M.L.S.) from Indiana University.    We all have a story, and we’re all historically significant.   ## Making history reflect a diverse reality  “Mrs. Moore dedicated her life to building a more inclusive history and we would like to keep her legacy alive by building a more inclusive profession in her honor,” says Andrea Copeland, chair of the Department of Library and Information Science, who collaborated with Moore on archiving projects.  Moore, who died April 18, 2018, worked for 30 years as senior archivist of African-American History at the Indiana History Center. “Your history is who you are,” Moore told The Indianapolis Recorder in 2013, “and when you get to a point where you somehow discount it or not think it’s important, you really diminish yourself.”  [The Indianapolis Recorder](http://www.indianapolisrecorder.com/news/article_476d1100-81c5-11e2-a88b-0019bb2963f4.html)   ## Moore Scholarship Recipients   ## Become part of the solution  By donating to the scholarship established in her honor, you become part of Wilma Moore’s legacy, documenting the history and preserving the heritage of Indiana’s diverse populations.

    "body": "  ## Students digitally document cultural treasures in Paros, Greece  September 16, 2016  This summer, eight students and two faculty members—Albert William and Thomas Lewis—from the IU School of Informatics and Computing (SOIC) at IUPUI traveled to the Greek Isles for a unique study abroad experience.  To preserve and celebrate Greece’s culture and history, SOIC students in the Media Arts and Science (MAS) program produced digital media projects such as documentary videos, 3-D animations, illustrative graphics, and photography.  The study abroad program focuses on the service-learning course Documenting Historical Cultural Artifacts and Traditions in Paros, Greece—offered in Summer Session I.  Paros is part of the Cyclades island group in the Aegean Sea, one hundred miles south of Athens. Inhabited since 3200 B.C., Paros is one of the Cyclades’ most picturesque islands, known for exquisite beaches, traditional villages, hilly countryside, vineyards, and incredible food. Today, the island is one of Greece’s most popular destinations for international visitors.  Students created videos about two unique archeological sites in the main town of Parikia: The Kastro of Parikia and The Ancient Cemetery: Parian Burial Traditions .  Students also digitally re-created a significant archeological site on the nearby island of Despotiko, working with the head archeologist and site architect. They created and textured a 3-D model to give life to the ongoing archeological dig. The model will be visible using virtual reality tools and has been rendered as a 3-D movie.  In the classroom, students met daily to discuss project updates and production techniques for documenting cultural artifacts and historical sites. Immersion in the local daily life of Parikia, where the group was housed in a small villa, was interspersed with field trips to archeological sites and museums—and a sea-kayaking trip.  “One day we were strangers, classmates—now we can call each other friends,” said SOIC student Tiffani Cornett. “We’ve spent a lot of time together. And we’ve come together as groups to create great projects,” she said.  The class will return to Paros for Summer Session I in 2017. To learn more and to view more student work, check out the Study Abroad in Greece program. Applications are being accepted through the Study Abroad Office until January 20, 2017.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Sights set on Hollywood: IUPUI student thrives in Semester in L.A. program  November 13, 2019  In summer 2019, four media arts and science students from the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI took part in the Semester in LA program, aka Hoosiers in Hollywood, led by the Media School at IU Bloomington. Pictured above, left to right, Chase Mathews interned at Foundation Films and DNA, Morgan Parsons at Pashionistas Project, Jacob McCarty at Cantina Creative and Gunpowder and Sky, and Sean Mullis at IKON Media. Each of them also shared their experience on our Instagram highlight @soicindy.  (Originally published in JagNews, Nov 13, 2019, written by Mary Olk)    (Video provided by Chase Mitchell)  Hollywood used to feel intangible for Chase Mitchell.  And now he doesn’t have to wonder what it would be like to live and work there. He knows.  He took the exciting, scary leap and applied for the Semester in L.A. program to complete his final semester at IUPUI.  “Anyone considering a career in the media field should apply for this program,” said Mitchell, who is studying media arts and science in the School of Informatics and Computing. “It’s been a huge, unparalleled and invaluable investment in myself and my future that I couldn’t have gotten anywhere else.”  Mitchell didn’t know anyone in Los Angeles and didn’t know what would happen when he arrived, but he’s become comfortable with being uncomfortable, which has literally paid off for him. California is a hub for all the skills in his toolbox — animation, graphic design and video production — and he’s putting those skills to work each day.  He’s involved with two different internships this semester. One is at Foundation Films as a graphic designer, and the second is marketing and content creation for an agency called DNA. At the film studio, he reads scripts that are in development and translates them into a variety of posters that are then further developed into the final art for each film production. At DNA, he’s become a creative resource for the company and its clients, creating graphics, animations and videos for a variety of campaigns.  “I’ve developed content for a former NFL player and a nanotechnology company, among other clients, which has given me great experience and content for my portfolio,” Mitchell said. “There are endless opportunities here and the means to do things I don’t think I could do in the Midwest.”  Chase Mitchell is completing two internships while he takes hands-on media classes through the Semester in L.A. program.  Mitchell’s internships keep him busy, but he’s also in classes as part of the program. He works 40 hours a week and takes classes in the evening. The classes are more hands-on and about getting him connected to the industry. He has worked with classmates to create and develop marketing campaigns for nonprofit organizations, heard from guest speakers throughout the media and film industries, and learned about the evolution of media technology.  “We recently took a tour through Warner Bros. Studios, where I got to see various sets from popular shows and films and original costumes and props,” Mitchell said. “Being around the development of movies from ideation to production is one of the coolest opportunities I could imagine being a part of.”  Insider knowledge, working on projects he’s only dreamed of doing, and growing personally and professionally are all perks of participating in this program. Mitchell’s biggest takeaway has been just how much he’s learned about marketing. “It’s been a huge, unparalleled and invaluable investment in myself and my future that I couldn’t have gotten anywhere else.”  “As a professional creative, I’m not only creating content for my various jobs but am also marketing myself and my skills,” he said. “I’ve learned there are formulas to market successfully, and I’ve been able to improve content at work as well as work on creating a personal brand for myself.”  Mitchell graduates from IUPUI this December with his bachelor’s degree, and he hopes that one of his internships will lead to a full-time position. He’s enjoyed living in L.A. — going to shows, skating, scoping out different galleries and enjoying the outdoors.  “Life in Hollywood goes on the same here as it does anywhere else,” he said. “The difference is that the weather is beautiful every day, and you might randomly see a celebrity while you’re out and about.”  If he has any advice for other media students considering an opportunity like this one, he said, it’s to not limit yourself, take risks, be confident and grow.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Professor Miller selected for elite ACM computing academy  June 9, 2017  Andrew Miller, assistant professor in the Human-Computer Interaction program at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, was recently selected for membership in the first Association for Computing Machinery-Future of Computing Academy (ACM-FCA).  The inaugural group in the ACM-FCA has 46 members—selected by a jury from over 300 applicants from around the world—originally from 19 different countries. Miller is the only member from IUPUI and Indiana University, and one of three from the state of Indiana.  “I’m thrilled to be joining the FCA as an inaugural member,” said Miller. “We have the opportunity to help interdisciplinary teams solve hard problems with computing at the core, and to help identify new pillars of computing research as they emerge. I’m excited to get to work on these issues, and proud to represent IUPUI and the IU School of Informatics and Computing!”  Read Miller’s ACM-FCA biography.  The ACM-FCA supports and fosters the next generation of computing professionals and enables researchers, practitioners, educators, and entrepreneurs to influence and address challenges facing the field and society in general.  “We are very proud of Andrew’s inclusion in this prestigious and selective academy of talented young researchers,” said Davide Bolchini, chair of the Department of Human-Centered Computing. “His energy and vision for shaping the discourse around cross-disciplinary, human-centered computing research in such a high-profile initiative has great potential to benefit current and future scholars.”  Miller says that because computing pervades so many areas of our lives, from the way we communicate with each other to the way we express ourselves through art, it’s difficult to know where the boundaries are. And it isn’t slowing down.  “Every day we seem to hear about a new area being transformed by computing technology, from transportation to toasters—the Internet of Things—to my own research area of health care,” said Miller. “With such rapid change, simply resetting the boundaries every couple of years doesn’t seem like enough. We need new approaches and ideas, and we need professional societies that are ready for the unanticipated.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Health Informatics Professor Receives $100,000 Grant as an Early-Career Scholar  March 26, 2014  A School of Informatics and Computing faculty member will receive a $100,000 grant and two years of targeted scientific mentoring after being selected as an early-career scholar by a national center that seeks to improve population health.    Brian Dixon, an assistant professor in health informatics, will receive the award from the National Coordinating Center for Public Health Services and Systems Research. The center is housed at the University of Kentucky College of Public Health and funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Dixon is also a research scientist at the Regenstrief Institute and an investigator in residence for the Center for Health Information and Communication, part of the Department of Veterans Affairs’ Health Services Research and Development Service.  In a statement, the National Coordinating Center for Public Health Services and Systems Research said the funding and mentorship are designed to speed the discovery of strategies for improving the nation’s public health system. Dixon and the three others who were named early-scholars are expected to become the next generation of national leaders in the field of public health services and systems research.  The scholars’ studies investigate innovative public health programs and practices that have the potential to improve health status on a population-wide basis but currently have insufficient evidence about their effectiveness and value, the center said.  The project Dixon will focus on is titled “Improving Vaccine-Preventable Disease Reporting and Surveillance Through Health Information Exchange.”  Dixon’s research will implement and evaluate an automated process designed to improve reporting rates for vaccine-preventable diseases in Indiana, and to support more efficient provider reporting to public health agencies. The process takes advantage of Indiana’s statewide health information exchange that enables data-sharing between clinical and public health organizations, and it replaces existing, inefficient reporting procedures involving manual completion of health department forms.  Data from the health information exchange will be used to partially complete many of the required fields submitted to public health departments leaving blank only a small number of fields for clinical providers to complete. The process will also help identify cases of vaccine-preventable diseases that providers might otherwise forget to report because of high patient volumes or missing information.  Regenstrief Institute investigator Dr. Shaun Grannis, associate professor of family medicine at the Indiana University School of Medicine, and P. Joseph Gibson, director of epidemiology at the Marion County Public Health Department, will serve as Dixon’s mentors. Grannis collaborates closely with state, national and international public health stakeholders to advance technical infrastructure and data-sharing capabilities for population health. Gibson oversees disease surveillance for Marion County and advises state and federal authorities on using information technologies to improve public health practice.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

A hold will be placed on the student’s record, and the student will be required to meet with an academic advisor prior to registration.  Dismissal  A student whose semester or cumulative GPA remains below 2.0 upon completion of the probationary semester will be dismissed from the program.  Readmission  Students who are dismissed for the first time must sit out for at least one semester and petition by the established deadlines to be eligible for readmission. Students dismissed more than once may not be readmitted. Readmitted students may only begin in the fall or spring semester.  [petition by the established deadlines](https://iu.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2gCrqWnWYYuKpOB)  Grade Replacement Policy for Undergraduate Students  The grade replacement is not available for graduate students or to students seeking a second undergraduate degree. It may be used for at most 15 credit hours, no more than twice for a given course, with each attempted replacement counting toward the 15 credit hour limit. Any grade may be replaced with the last grade earned for the course, as long as the most recent grade is equal to or higher than the grade being replaced. The replaced grade will then be excluded from the cumulative GPA. However, the course listing and the replaced grade will remain on the student’s academic record with an “X” notation.  The policy became effective from the fall 1996 semester, and any courses being used to replace an earlier grade must have been taken in the fall of 1996 or later. Grades previously granted FX will be honored and will count toward the 15 credit hour limit. Once granted for a given course, a student may not subsequently request reversal of the grade replacement. Please see your academic advisor to discuss grade replacement.    Minimum Grade Requirement  All undergraduate students must earn a grade of C- or higher in all courses, including major, minor, and electives.

Adjunct Professor of Practice   ### Contact  llenzi@iupui.edu   ### Education   ### Biography  After retiring as a senior executive in the world of industrial design, Lou Lenzi has forged another career as a human-computer interaction instructor. He offers the new generation of innovators a valuable real-world perspective, and opportunities to engage with industry innovators.  In 2016 Lenzi was named one of the Top 50 Industrial Designers over the last 50 years by the Industrial Designers Society of America.  He is the architect of our school’s Industry Lecture Series, which began in 2017. This series has brought professionals from logistics, agriculture, government, and other sectors to the school to share insights on the Internet of Things and to partner with students on projects through the school’s Department of Human-Centered Computing .  [Department of Human-Centered Computing](https://luddy.iupui.edu/hcc/)  In his classes, Lenzi has helped students to see how physical products can utilize human-computer interaction theory and online technology. In 2018 he represented Indiana University at the opening of the Indiana IoT Lab in Fishers. In this space for innovation, staff, faculty members and students can utilize everything from 3-D printers and touch-screen walls to table saws as they create product designs.  [Indiana IoT Lab](https://news.iu.edu/stories/2018/03/iupui/inside/29-iupui-educator-iot-ideas.html)  At academic, trade and professional society venues, Lenzi has given numerous lectures and presentations on design, innovation, and its impact on business. Prior to joining our faculty, he amassed 36 years of experience creating, developing, and sustaining high-performing product and service design organizations within complex, multinational corporations, notably IBM, Thomson/RCA, and GE.  Lenzi increased the impact and effectiveness of design within these organizations, developing design strategies and innovation initiatives to meet the overall goals of the business. Along with growing design teams organically, he led the integration of design functions following multiple business acquisitions while at Thomson/RCA.  As an organizational leader, Lenzi built multi-disciplinary design teams in order to create a seamless customer experience, from the physical object to digital interfaces and end-user services. He worked successfully across a broad range of industries, from consumer products, to digital media and home entertainment services, and medical diagnostic imaging equipment and health care information systems.

[Fawzi Ben Messaoud](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/fawzi-benmessaoud/)  Ben Messaoud is a lecturer in Informatics and AI for the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI. His FazBoard project has been selected for inclusion in the 2022 EDUCAUSE Horizon Report, Teaching and Learning Edition (see page 21 ).  [School of Informatics and Computing](https://luddy.iupui.edu/)  [2022 EDUCAUSE Horizon Report, Teaching and Learning Edition](https://library.educause.edu/-/media/files/library/2022/4/2022hrteachinglearning.pdf?la=en&hash=6F6B51DFF485A06DF6BDA8F88A0894EF9938D50B)  A nonprofit association dedicated to advancing higher education via information technology, EDUCASE issues its highly regarded annual Horizon Report to highlight trends and key technologies shaping the future of higher education around the world.  [Horizon Report](https://library.educause.edu/resources/2022/4/2022-educause-horizon-report-teaching-and-learning-edition)  The annual Horizon report “is based on the perspectives and expertise of a global panel of leaders from across the higher education landscape,” EDUCAUSE says on its website.   ### A learning tool that learns  In partnership with the virtual visual canvas collaboration platform Alleo, SoIC lecturer Ben Messaoud and his team developed a teaching and learning tool they dubbed the FazBoard.  As Ben Messaoud describes it, “FazBoard is a human-AI hybrid system using an infinite digital canvas with embedded AI-Assistant to simulate the teacher’s, individual, and collaborative learning spaces.  “It integrates teaching/learning materials and provides 24/7 instant responses and access to a virtual Teacher Assistant automating the collection of students’ inquiries and learning analytics.”  Results from the project will be used to help adjust the curriculum, Ben Messaoud says. This may include its difficulty or clarity, the method and style of delivery—even its substance.  After surveying students who used the program, Ben Messaoud says, “More than 82% of the 17 students in the survey agree that FazBoard with the AI assistant can improve the student/teacher communication.”   ### Developed with student input  Ben Messaoud worked with research assistant May Charles Samuel, and students Jay Conway, Marat Kornyev, and Hope Willis to create FazBoard. The goal: to address students’ engagement, connectedness, and equity in learning outcomes.  All students are capable of learning, Ben Messaoud says. “But they learn in different ways.”  Ben Messaoud and the team utilized Alleo virtual collaboration software to develop a platform that would achieve several objectives:  Ben Messaoud has enjoyed discovering how students are using FazBoard.  “I was surprised at how significantly the platform made the learning experience collaborative and personalized,” he says. “As a result, it is more engaging, fun, and productive for my students.”     ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Human-centered computing students find continued success in IoT  August 6, 2018  Two students in Professor of Practice Lou Lenzi’s INFO H567 class at the Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI were part of a three-person team that recently won the True AR Challenge. Members of Team HCI, Sandeep Jagtap and Rahul Jain, along with Pruthviraj Narayanaswamy, took first place for their AR (augmented reality)-based solution fitted to fire trucks.  True AR Challenge is an AR app design challenge for developers and designers, sponsored by WayRay, a pioneer of holographic AR displays. In February, WayRay challenged AR enthusiasts to come up with a concept for a new AR app for cars over a three-month period.  Team HCI developed a holographic windshield navigation app, called Fire Ray, to help fire emergency vehicle drivers respond to accidents quickly, efficiently, and safely. Rahul Jain explained that all emergency vehicles need to have best in class technology to save citizens from an emergency situation. “H567 taught us frameworks to solve business and design problems in a very user-centered way. Applying those methods helped us in telling a better story with data,” Jain said.  Way Ray will fly Team HCI this fall to California to work on a prototype.   ### Real world lessons  Lenzi’s class, Topics in Human-Centered Computing (Lenzi’s students study Internet of Things (IoT) Interface Design for Business Innovation), is offered twice a year—fall and spring semester—and focuses on solutions to real-world problems through industry-sponsored projects. The Internet of Things is a network of connected physical objects or “smart devices” that collect and exchange data. Students develop and refine IoT interfaces and their business models, while acquiring skills through their team-based projects.  Each semester, industry sponsors meet with the class to kick off the project and then return to evaluate the results. Last school year, sponsors Amazon.com, General Electric, Crown Equipment, IBM, Beck’s Hybrids, and the City of Rushville led study modules focusing on specific industry verticals. The representatives then issued a design challenge to the students that addressed a potential future disruption to their respective industries.  The industry representatives are also invited to deliver a talk at the School of Informatics and Computing as part of its Industry Lecture Series, which is free and open to the public. The fall 2018 schedule will include presentations by Sirius XM Radio, Shure Corp., and Delta Faucet.   ### A direct pipeline from IoT project to internship  As a result of her experience with a H567 course project on smart cities, involving the city of Rushville, IN, one student is now interning with the city of Boston. Rachana Solanki is  spending the summer working in the mayor’s Office of Neighborhood Services. She is working on their Language and Communication Access (LCA) program, as a user experience designer, helping to make Boston more accessible for all residents.  “I am delighted and proud of this outcome,” said Lenzi. “Rachana successfully translated the lessons learned in the classroom into an opportunity to apply those skills as a UX designer employed by one of the most prominent and forward-thinking cities in the U.S.”  Solanki credits the job offer to her experience working on the “Smart City of Rushville” project in H567. “The hiring manager in Boston was really interested in the project, the process, and the results, as much of the interview was spent on this topic,” Solanki said.   ### Hacking public safety  Earlier in the year, students from Lenzi’s class distinguished themselves at the AT&T IoT Civic Hackathon, held this year at the newly opened Indiana IoT Lab in Fishers, IN. The Hackathon hosted over 200 developers from 30 teams. The theme this year was public safety and solutions to help first responders.  The First Volunteer team—Anagha Varrier, Jagtap, and Jain—earned first place for Best FirstNet App, as well as a second place finish for Best Mobile App. FirstNet is the First Responder Network Authority whose mission is to develop, build and operate the nationwide broadband network that equips first responders to save and protect lives in the U.S.  Often in the case of a massive natural disaster, civilians are the first on the scene to provide help. First Volunteer offers quick assistance to first responders, like fire and police department personnel, through registered civilian volunteers.   ### Taking IoT to the world  Lenzi originally conceived his IoT course because he believes students that possess HCI-based skills coupled with basic business design principles can drive innovation across any number of industry verticals and governmental operations.  Lenzi noted the results from the first two semesters are very encouraging. “I’m truly impressed with how our students are so committed to their education, taking the initiative to go outside the classroom and work on projects to improve our communities,” Lenzi said.   #### About Lou Lenzi    Lou Lenzi retired as a senior executive with experience at IBM, Thomson/RCA, and GE, and joined the IU School of Informatics and Computing as a human-computer interaction instructor. In 2016, Lenzi was named one of the top 50 Industrial Designers over the last 50 years by the Industrial Designers Society of America, and in 2018, he represented Indiana University at the opening of the Indiana IoT Lab in Fishers.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Health Information Administration program marks 60th anniversary at IUPUI  April 14, 2010  The Health Information Administration (HIA) program at the IU School of Informatics and Computing proudly marks its 60th anniversary on the IUPUI campus this spring. The program prepares students to assume increasingly critical roles in our health care industry, specializing in the design and maintenance of health information systems to collect, analyze, interpret and protect patient data. Its more than 600 alumni have gone on to establish careers within a variety of health care settings, serving as directors, managers, consultants and information security officers. The HIA program and its students have enjoyed a near 100% employment rate upon graduation for the past seven years, no doubt benefiting from Indiana’s strong life science industry and Indianapolis’ strong network of hospitals and physicians.  The future of the program and its graduates continues to look promising. 2010-11 statistics published by the U.S. Department of Labor expect employment in the health information field to grow by at least 20%, well above national career growth averages. This is in no doubt fueled in part by national health care reform and the 2009 American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA). Both measures are expected to spur the adoption of health information technologies, such as the electronic health record (EHR), in preparation for a wave of new and aging patients entering hospitals and exam rooms nationwide.  The Health Information Administration program was first founded by Gertrude Gunn, RRL, as the Medical Record Administration Program in 1950 – the first program of its kind in the United States to be established within a state university. It was formerly part of the IU School of Allied Health before becoming a vital component of the IU School of Informatics and Computing in 2003. The curriculum includes coursework in business, information systems and technology, ethics, anatomy, physiology and personnel management, as well as mentored clinical experiences in health care settings.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

Raspberry Pi from Scratch from Plymouth High School won first place, Terre Haute South High School took second, and Nextech Catapults placed third.  This year’s challenge was to create a mobile application—from start to finish in less than 8 hours—that would help voters navigate the election process more easily and successfully.  Travis Faas, media arts and science faculty member and co-organizer for the event, asked the teams to design an application that dealt with the voting procedure here in the United States—finding polls and polling times, figuring out who to vote for, staying informed—or changing the process to be more open for the voting populace.  Christopher Ha, undergraduate recruiter and event co-organizer said, “I would like to thank all the participants and adult mentors for attending this competition. It was wonderful to see all the hard work students put into their final product. This year, each team had to present their developed mobile application to a panel of judges. There were so many different ideas and perspectives, and it was great for everyone to see that. This competition really allows students to explore an opportunity in technology. As a school, we are proud to be able to provide undergraduate programs that are tailored to these students’ interests and abilities.”  This is the fifth year for the challenge, which has grown in interest and popularity.

    "body": "  ## Media Arts and Science Faculty, Students Collaborate with School of Medicine to Create AMPATH Health Education Videos  February 18, 2014  Media Arts and Science lecturer, Thomas Lewis, a group of students, and the Indiana University School of Medicine recently teamed up to create a series of healthcare videos for AMPATH, (American Model Providing Access to Healthcare), a consortium of North American academic health institutions that provide healthcare in partnership with Kenya’s Moi University.    The videos were created to be instrumental in therapy and counseling sessions for those suffering from AIDS and HIV in western Kenya. With Dr. Rachel Vreeman, of IU’s Department of Pediatrics, Lewis developed a series of culturally appropriate videos that are being used within Dr. Vreeman’s ongoing pediatric clinical trial in Kenya. Caregivers and patients are using these videos in individual and group counseling sessions in several AMPATH clinics as patients learn of their HIV status (disclosure). The clinical trial, called HADITHI (Swahili for story), aims to evaluate the efficacy of an intensive package of patient-centered, clinic-based resources designed to support families going through the HIV disclosure process.  “The videos use narrative filmmaking therapeutically,” said Lewis.  “Patients and caregivers will watch the videos, and we hope they address many of their concerns about HIV disclosure.  I hope the videos help patients and caregivers navigate through a lot of the issues they might be facing.”  The videos were made financially possible through an International Development Fund Grant.  After Lewis secured the grant and travelled to Kenya to shoot the videos with local talent and crew, Media Arts and Science students, Mike Lulgjuraj, Eric Thaddeus Andrews, Jessica Carr, were then hired to help with post-production.   Because all of the videos were created in the native Swahili language, international students, Sheila Ngetich, and Alex Migiro, were also brought on board during post-production to serve as translators.  After the videos were completed, Lewis worked closely with Lulgjuraj to develop an app for the videos. This allows the videos to be used on hundreds of Nexus tablets recently donated to AMPATH by Google.  “Being able to use my skills and experience in production and post-production, incorporating a real hands-on learning experience for students, along with the collaboration with the School of Medicine was truly a great opportunity,” said Lewis.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## How digital 3-D sculpting is changing the face of prosthetics  February 16, 2016  Updated June 30, 2016  Media Arts and Science faculty member Zebulun Wood and his student researcher, 2016 graduate Cade B.T. Jacobs, created a prosthetic mandible utilizing digital scanning and 3-D sculpture and printing technology—revolutionizing a field that has long relied on more cumbersome materials and techniques.    Their work, and the unique collaboration between the IU School of Informatics and Computing and the IU School of Dentistry at IUPUI, is putting a new face on maxillo-facial prosthetic prototypes and the patients who use them. The partnership capitalizes on IUPUI’s vast expertise to create processes that assist in digital surgical design.  Dr. Travis Bellicchi from the School of Dentistry approached Wood when his patient Shirley Anderson required a new prosthetic—the size of which made traditional methods both time consuming and challenging.  The work positions IUPUI as a pioneer in pursuing digital 3-D sculpting and printing to create skin-based facial prosthetics made of silicone.  Wood and Jacobs, pictured with the model of Anderson’s digitally created likeness, utilized technology and the expertise of staff from the Advanced Visualization Lab (AVL) to create the new mandible.  “Without Travis’s vision and excitement, these opportunities wouldn’t exist,” says Wood, a digital arts and media lecturer who had never considered using digital 3-D technologies in this way. “It’s nice to be on a campus with a health care focus like IUPUI—to be in an atmosphere where helping others is integral to our research.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## The Offer Process  The key to receiving an offer is understanding the stages of the interview and offer process and preparing for each stage appropriately. The following is an example of a typical interview and offer process and what you can expect from each stage.   ### First-Round Interview  The first interview is often the shortest in length and lacks in-depth questions. Employers are looking for a positive first impression and for a measure of “fit” with their organization. The employer’s questions are often behavioral in nature, and you should come prepared with several questions to ask the employer.   ### Second-Round Interview  This interview is often more in-depth. You may travel on-site to the company and meet with multiple people during the interview. Tours, meals, and networking events may also be included along with a more traditional interview. Employers with virtual interviews may also schedule multiple people. Some employers will also incorporate a technical or case component into this stage of the interview process. Before the interview is over, ask for next steps, and be prepared to wait two weeks or more for an answer.   ### Receive an Offer  Employers will often call with an offer rather than email. Be ready for the phone call and make sure to return a missed call immediately. If you receive an offer and you accept immediately over the phone, you are accepting the initial terms of the offer and may not negotiate. You may NOT negotiate after you have accepted an offer. If you would like to negotiate, do so before you provide a final answer to the employer. See the negotiation process webpage for more guidance. If you would like some time to evaluate the offer, which is perfectly acceptable, be sure to express your appreciation and ask for a date by which you need to provide them with your final answer. Be sure to ask for a copy of a formal written offer so you can evaluate all the components of the offer, including salary, benefits, 401k, vacation policy, etc.  Feel free to schedule an appointment with a career advisor if you would like to talk through your offer. As a general rule, employers are expected to give students a reasonable amount of time to make a decision. Exploding offers (offers that require students to accept an offer within a very short time frame, such as 48 hours) are unacceptable, and you should notify our office if an employer makes an exploding offer or exerts undue pressure on you to make a quick decision.   ### Accept or Decline Offer  Be sure to accept or decline the offer in the requested time frame. Once you have accepted an offer verbally or in writing for a full-time position or internship, it is ethically wrong to continue to interview, send letters of application, and conduct other job search activities for opportunities with similar or competing start dates as the accepted offer.   ### Reneging on Job Offers  Reneging is a serious offense. Accepting a job or internship offer after you have already accepted an offer with a different employer or internship is defined as “reneging” and is considered dishonest, unprofessional, and unethical. By accepting a job offer verbally or in writing, you are making a formal commitment to the employer. Reneging on an offer is unacceptable and not only damages your personal credibility and professional reputation, but also reflects badly on the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering. In addition, the employer may decide to discontinue recruiting at the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering, thus jeopardizing opportunities for future students. "

This strong focus on the human use of computing helps people to interact with technology in the best and most efficient way possible.  At the Luddy Indianapolis, we believe informatics is the human part of the IT equation, making computer software and hardware relatable, accessible, and enjoyable to use.   ## The architect of our experience with technology  With the right hardware (construction materials) and software (knowledge), engineers can create a building that is structurally sound. But the architect transforms it into a livable space, placing doors, windows, and utilities with functionality and ease of use in mind. It’s also possible to prepare food with the proper equipment and a recipe, but it takes a chef to transform ingredients into an unforgettable meal.  Likewise, informatics is about understanding how people will “live” in the digital space, with an elegance of design that makes sense to users of a particular technology. The informatician examines the data to discover solutions and determines which hardware and software will deliver the best user experience possible.   ## Informatics is everywhere  Nearly every area of our lives—community, arts, health, business, science—is influenced and enhanced by informatics.

Holden, an assistant professor of health informatics in the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI.  To prevent hospitalization and death, many patients with chronic heart failure receive an implantable electronic device that delivers cardiac resynchronization therapy along with other interventions. The device also collects data on cardiac function and device activity.  Power to the Patient will use that data to improve patient self-care by delivering to patients their own personalized health information right away.  Currently, data from the electronic devices are transmitted to a collection point on a secure server and then made available to clinical staff for review. Patients eventually either receive a form letter saying all is well or are asked to visit the clinic for follow-up, according to Holden.  “For patients, the implantable device is currently a black box holding powerful data they never see and cannot act upon,” Holden said. “This is akin to installing a car’s fuel gauge inside the mechanic’s shop, not in the driver’s dashboard. You would have to call the mechanic’s shop to find out if your car was low on fuel or hope they would call you. It puts the critical actor out of the loop, powerless to act or adapt in a timely fashion.”  Keeping these patients out of the loop is especially problematic because their health depends on informed self-care, Holden said.  The Power to the Patient system will process data from the implantable devices alongside patient-reported information entered via a simple user interface, he said. It will then transmit reports and recommendations directly to the patient through a variety of user interface channels, such as an online patient portal or a wrist-worn smartwatch.  The researchers have two objectives, Holden said. One is to understand how people make decisions when they have a device that’s producing data. The other is to develop Power to the Patient prototype devices that will be tested in a laboratory setting with patients.  The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality awarded Holden $293,786 to conduct the 18-month project.  Dr. Michael J. Mirro, a cardiac electrophysiologist with Parkview Health in Fort Wayne, has led a clinical and informatics team messaging patients’ implantable device data. He also serves as a member of the Indiana University Board of Trustees.  “Partnering with Dr. Holden and the IU informatics team has allowed our clinical team at Parkview Health to move the needle on sharing patients’ own lifesaving data with them,” Mirro said. “This will, certainly, result in improved patient outcomes, saving lives and reducing the cost of care.”  Other co-investigators are Davide Bolchini, School of Informatics and Computing, IUPUI, and Tammy Toscos, Parkview Research Center, Parkview Health.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Two School of Informatics and Computing researchers receive prestigious NSF CAREER grants  April 10, 2020  Both Khairi Reda , assistant professor of data science and human-computer interaction (HCI), and Jingwen Yan , assistant professor of bioinformatics, recently were awarded 5-year CAREER grants by the National Science Foundation (NSF).  [Khairi Reda](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/khairi-reda/)  [Jingwen Yan](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/jingwen-yan/)  According to the NSF, The Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program is a Foundation-wide activity that offers the National Science Foundation’s most prestigious awards in support of early-career faculty who have the potential to serve as academic role models in research and education and to lead advances in the mission of their department or organization.  IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI Senior Executive Associate Dean Mathew J. Palakal , said, “We are enormously proud of Khairi and Jingwen, who received the first two NSF CAREER Awards in the history of our school at IUPUI. These are highly esteemed grants, awarded only to those proposals that can demonstrate high-quality original research combined with promising educational opportunities for students.”  [Mathew J. Palakal](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/mathew-palakal/)   #### Khairi Reda  The goal of Reda’s $538,140 grant project, titled, “ Towards Trustworthy Analytics ,“ is to reduce the risk of “false discovery” from data.  [Towards Trustworthy Analytics](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1942429&HistoricalAwards=false)  “Data visualization is increasingly important for discovery and decision-making in a range of domains, from science and engineering to commerce. However, visualizations can also expose random data fluctuations, which could be mistaken for real patterns. If analysts are not careful in interpreting these apparent patterns, they could inadvertently make false discoveries or take incorrect decisions, ” Reda said.  Reda’s team will develop tools to aid analysts in assessing the reliability of data patterns, while guarding against visualizations that seem convincing but that are likely to be misleading. The project is expected to help broaden the adoption of visual analysis tools, increase the confidence in conclusions, and potentially reduce the incidence of false discovery.  As part of this research, the team will develop interactive educational materials for training students in reliable data-driven inference, which will be disseminated to data science instructors for inclusion into existing curricula. The project will also provide opportunities for graduate research training and incorporate K-12 outreach activities that introduce young learners to data science.  Davide Bolchini , chair of the Department of Human-Centered Computing, said, “Khairi’s NSF CAREER project is very exciting and gives him a solid foundation for career-long scientific and educational contributions at the forefront of HCI and Human-Centered Data Science. With the proliferation of tools and dashboards for data-intensive interactive visualizations of broad interest to the world population, it is now of paramount importance to determine when and how our micro-interactions with visualizations increase the probability of errors in interpreting data.  His project seeks to fundamentally advance our understanding of the analyst’s intent in interactive data analysis and form the research basis to develop a new generation of interactive tools that better match error-free visualizations to that intent. We are all very proud of his significant achievement.”  [Davide Bolchini](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/davide-bolchini/)   #### Jingwen Yan  Yan’s $549,909 grant project, titled “ Computational strategies for incompleteness and heterogeneity in multi-omic data ,” will provide novel perspectives in handling the incompleteness and heterogeneity problems in multi-omics data and hereafter allow biomedical researchers to gain more insights from rapidly growing yet imperfect biomedical data. Multi-omics refers to the integrative analysis of multiple types of -omics data, for example, genotype, gene expression, and protein expression.  [Computational strategies for incompleteness and heterogeneity in multi-omic data](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/simpleSearchResult?queryText=1942394&ActiveAwards=true)  “Increasing multi-omic data provides opportunities for discovery of disease biomarkers from multiple molecular scales and therefore can further our understanding of underlying disease mechanisms. Despite this great potential, existing multi-omic data collections are mostly incomplete and of heterogeneous types, such as continuous and categorical numbers. Integrating these data for joint analysis typically requires exclusion of many subjects with missing values; as a consequence, a large chunk of data remains unused, “ Yan said.  Yan’s team aims to develop new classes of computational methods to enable the joint mining of incomplete and heterogeneous multi-omic data by leveraging various biological networks for discovery of functionally connected biomarkers. This will be accomplished through development of a multi-task joint network module detection and feature selection model and a novel multi-task sparse association model. This research effort will lead to discovery of more reliable biomarkers for further validation and better understanding of their relationships with disease traits than currently possible.  The research will also support several outreach activities including developing a project-based curriculum and hosting an annual summer workshop on multi-omics for high school students, as well as providing advanced research opportunities to undergraduates from biomedical informatics and related disciplines.  Huanmei Wu , chair of the Department of BioHealth Informatics, said, “Dr. Yan’s CAREER grant aligns well with her long-term research goal and will fulfill her research vision in translational bioinformatics. The funded project will apply innovative network science and emerging -omics technology to translational life science research by making the connections from genes to protein to metabolites, then to individual health. Her project will help us to better understand the influential factors of health, disease, and biological systems, from individuals to population outcomes. I can foresee the research outcome improving human health care in our daily lives.”  [Huanmei Wu](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/huanmei-wu/)   #### Acknowledgement  This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1942429 and Grant No. 1942394.

    "body": "  ## School of Informatics and Computing and My Health Care Manager collaboration receives $1.25 million to help seniors better navigate the healthcare system  October 6, 2010  With the dramatic growth of the senior population, aging Americans and their families need easy access to the most up-to-date information to enable them in making informed decisions regarding their well being. The National Institutes of Health has acknowledged this need by awarding a $1.25 million Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant to a collaboration between the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI and My Health Care Manager, Inc., a national leader in managing the issues and options of aging. The grant will be used to enhance My Health Care Manager’s proprietary suite of software and decision support system entitled Senior Care Navigation System or SCANS®.  SCANS® enables health care managers to tap into industry-wide best practices, recommended actions and real world tools in order to help seniors and their families make critical decisions. Through its text mining laboratory led by Mathew Palakal, Ph.D., the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI will add increased functionality to SCANS® by developing an automated knowledge acquisition system. This system will mine large, text-based literature databases to allow senior care agencies and providers to access the latest research on geriatric health issues – information that could significantly impact healthcare decisions made by seniors and their families.  “There is a rapidly growing need in this country for improvements in older adult care planning. We are losing billions of hours and dollars in lost productivity as families struggle to provide much needed assistance for loved ones based upon fragmented, incomplete and outdated information,” said Jane Niederberger, president, My Health Care Manager. “The outcome and application of this research from the NIH grants will provide timelier, concrete, actionable advice and support for caregivers to enhance the well-being of seniors. SCANS® is changing the face of senior care and how to deliver it faster, with higher quality and consistency.”  “Our SCANS®/Care Advisor technology directly addresses the challenges of the older adult and their families as they attempt to navigate the health care system by helping geriatric care managers provide the best practice caregiving advice,” said Eric Tinsley, chief technology officer and vice president of research and development. “The system dramatically improves the efficiency; completeness, consistency, and quality of care planning in addition to providing practical tools to implement the recommendations contained in the plan.”  The NIH’s SBIR grant comes after the Indiana Economic Development Corporation provided a $1.9 million grant from the Indiana’s 21st Century Research and Technology Fund to initially develop SCANS® in 2008. My Health Care Manager was recently recognized with a TechPoint Mira Award for SCANS®/Care Advisor. The information technology system was created by an extensive team of experts in geriatric medicine, health informatics, engineering and computer science, and is the foundation of My Health Care Manager’s holistic, personalized and comprehensive approach to geriatric management services for seniors and families.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## One hundred twelve Indiana teachers attend virtual Computing by Design (CxD) Fellows workshop  August 26, 2020  The Indiana Department of Education (IDOE)-funded CxD program kicked off on June 1, 2020 with an online orientation, welcoming teachers from across the state who had signed up to learn how to deliver computer science education for their students.  In 2019, the State of Indiana announced that elementary, middle, and high schools throughout Indiana would be required to offer at least one computing course to each and every Hoosier student by fall 2021. To address this critical need, the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI presented their successful Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce (iDEW) curriculum to the IDOE, which funded the summer training program. And then the pandemic struck.  [Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce](https://luddy.iupui.edu/idew/)  Undeterred, the iDEW instructors pivoted and adapted the workshop for online delivery, limited to public and public charter schools.  The School of Informatics and Computing (SoIC) partnered with techserv.io to promote the workshop and quickly attracted well over 100 applicants for the workshop, which was held June 1–July 2.  “The CxD Teacher Training program went extremely well, beyond our expectations, thanks to the creativity and dedication of SoIC faculty and staff who were involved with the program to effectively deliver this training virtually,” said Mathew J. Palakal , senior executive associate dean of the School of Informatics and Computing and iDEW program director. “We expect that these high school teachers will adopt the CxD curriculum in their computing classes to instill interest in computing careers among students. We are extremely grateful to IDOE for providing us with the generous award.”  [Mathew J. Palakal](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/mathew-palakal/)   ### Learning experiences benefit both teachers and students  The CxD curriculum is modeled on the project-based iDEW program currently in use at eight Indianapolis area high schools, and is driven by the CxD principles of Research, Design, Prototype, and Implement.  Holly Hook, who teaches a variety of business and computer science classes to grades 9–12 at North Montgomery High School, registered for both personal and professional reasons. “Personally, I love learning and expanding my teaching toolbox to better serve my students,” Hook said. “Also, pre-COVID, I was really excited to be attending a workshop on a college campus!”  “Professionally, this workshop seemed like it would be a good fit to start introducing project-based learning in my computer science (CS) classes. Ultimately, I want to create a capstone CS class for students and the CxD curriculum seems like a perfect solution,” Hook said.  Hook explained that “the most valuable aspect of this workshop has been the ability to complete tasks at my own pace, sharing information and getting feedback with cohort members utilizing Slack, and having the chance to complete different CxD projects myself!” It will also provide students a learning environment that mimics the industry setting, she added.  Mike Spock, who teaches math and computer science at Columbus North High School, was interested in the CxD workshop because of the project-based learning that it promoted. He was also looking forward to getting a chance to connect with other computer science teachers and share ideas.  “The CxD projects have a wonderful structure that I am excited to use with my students, in particular, in the AP Computer Science Principles class. These are great resources to teach my students programming and abstraction as well as teamwork and project management. The resources connected to these projects will help all students have success in computer science,” Spock said.

    "body": "  ## Health Informatics student is runner up in IUPUI 3-Minute Pitch competition  January 13, 2023  Barakha Jain’s vision of bridging the gap between technology and healthcare motivated her to pursue a master’s degree in health informatics at the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering at IUPUI. Jain (pictured above, right, with Tabitha Hardy, AVC Graduate Education, left) recently put that vision into practical use with her 3-Minute Pitch (3MP) competition topic, “Development and Evaluation of a Special Care Teledentistry OSCE, Involving Visually Impaired Patients”, which resulted in her winning runner up.  [master’s degree in health informatics](https://luddy.iupui.edu/biohealth/graduate/health-informatics/masters/)  She chose Luddy IUPUI for its accreditation and reputation, and says the IUPUI graduate program is very broad and competitive, enabling students to explore their hidden talents.  For her pitch, Jain drew on her work as a Community Engagement Assistant under Professor Stuart Schrader at the IU School of Dentistry . The School has been partnered with Standardized Patients living with visual impairment—the BOSMA Community—for nearly a decade, performing Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) as a simulation study. OSCE assesses second-year dental students abilities to address the patient treatment needs by evaluating their communicative practices and skills.  [IU School of Dentistry](https://dentistry.iu.edu/)  The pandemic necessitated a pivot from Face-to-Face (FTF) to remote assessment modalities such as teleconferencing. Consequently, Schrader’s group initiated a study to understand any differences between how dental students perform FTF or remote/online OSCEs, in particular with those patients who are visually impaired. The results showed that achievement was lower during teledentistry as compared to in-person due to unclear explanation and stereotyping. Therefore, further training of the dental students is required.  “This gave me an opportunity to be a part of the research that will prepare the dentist of tomorrow to not just use teledentistry but also to build a human-to-human connection through teledentistry,” Jain said.  The 3-minute pitch competition at IUPUI, held during the Preparing Future Faculty and Professionals (PFFP) Annual Pathways Conference, is for master’s level students. Jain said it was an enriching experience. “To be honest, it was very challenging to concisely capture the huge amount of research into a three-minute pitch. However, with timely guidance and assistance from mentors of the Preparing Future Faculty and Professionals (PFFP) team, it was seamlessly conquered. Also, it was rewarding to learn and grow from other participants and their diverse experiences. It also gave me a chance to meet and greet various disciplines of informatics,” Jain said.  [3-minute pitch competition](https://graduate.iupui.edu/support/pffp/3mt.html)  Watch video of 2022 3MP Pitch Competition  [Watch video of 2022 3MP Pitch Competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TbmHRCX4Lw)  “If an individual like me, who has always been paranoid with large gatherings, was able to pitch my thoughts on stage in just three minutes and win it, I firmly believe if I can win it, you can too.” Jain also encourages others to find the purpose of the work they do and the rest will follow.  Following graduation, Jain will be embarking on a career as a product analyst for the Healthcare IT company, Clinical Architecture, where she hopes to strengthen her research and technical skills and “innovate more robust technologies that will push (her) closer to her goal.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

Photo by Tina Rice, School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI)   ### IUPUI’s Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce program has launched summer program providing educational opportunities during pandemic  Although many summer activities are canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a newly launched initiative from IUPUI’s award-winning IT workforce development program is providing 625 local high school students in underrepresented minorities the opportunity to participate in STEM-related workshops and trainings through a virtual format.  Established in 2015 by the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, the Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce , or iDEW, program has launched the AT&T iDEW Summer Distance Program.  [Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce](https://luddy.iupui.edu/idew/)  This year’s activities, which run through Aug. 1, include Scrum training /project management certification, Code Black Indy -Salesforce project build-out training, Black Data Processing Associates -iDEW mentorship and a customized “speaking college,” as well as a virtual workshop in game and creature design taught by school faculty. In addition, students will be guided by trained IUPUI student mentors, who will encourage and support them along the way.  [Scrum training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development))  [Code Black Indy](https://codeblackindy.org/)  [Black Data Processing Associates](http://www.bdpa-indy.org/)  iDEW provides free computing by design (CxD) support and instruction to students from eight area high schools — Pike, Providence Cristo Rey, Arsenal Technical, Herron, George Washington, Riverside, McKenzie Center for Innovation and Technology, and Southport — and has reached more than 1,680 students through its curriculum. The program, which recently completed its fifth year, has graduated 492 students, and over 90 percent are now attending college, 80 percent in STEM-related majors.  Beyond completing learning modules in robotics, Internet of Things, trivia apps, chatbots/artificial intelligence, and video game design and data visualization, iDEW students are offered internship opportunities, visit IT industries, receive SAT prep assistance, and attend summer workshops and national IT conferences. In addition to building coding skills, students develop confidence and learn teamwork and communication.  The AT&T iDEW Summer Distance Program is made possible by a $50,000 grant from the AT&T Foundation and will fund students’ participation in these summer technology workshops and trainings.  [AT&T Foundation](https://about.att.com/csr/home.html)  “We are proud to support programs like IUPUI’s iDEW that are helping people from diverse and underrepresented backgrounds build the skills they need for successful careers in STEM fields,” said Bill Soards, president of AT&T Indiana. “The high school students participating in the program will become the future workers who help our world stay connected when we aren’t able to be together in person.”  The summer program is also supported by a $10,000 grant from the Donaldson Foundation , the philanthropic arm of Donaldson Filtration Solutions, which has manufacturing or distribution sites in Anderson, Frankfort and Rensselaer.  [Donaldson Foundation](https://www.donaldson.com/en-us/about-us/who-we-are/donaldson-foundation/)  “We are excited and honored to contribute to the success of the iDEW program,” said Chini Zeman, a Donaldson Foundation board member. “Donaldson has a strong footprint in the greater Indianapolis community, and this program allows us to help support our community while aligning perfectly with our core charter of supporting educational opportunities for those who otherwise might not have them.”  “We have grown the iDEW program in size and scope over the last five years,” added Mathew J. Palakal , senior executive associate dean of the School of Informatics and Computing and program director for iDEW. “These grants give us needed resources to fund this unique opportunity to benefit underserved youth in the Indianapolis community during the summer months as well.”  [Mathew J.

[Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering in Indianapolis](https://luddy.iupui.edu/)  Moore was a leader in preserving and promoting African American history and culture in Indianapolis. Both recipients – Tamara Rogers (above, left) and Sylvia Faith Burlock (right) – want to use their degrees to take on leadership roles in libraries, and to continue Moore’s legacy of African-American librarianship and diversify the profession.  “I’m humbled by these great women who want to turn their talents to librarianship,” says Andrea Copeland , Ph.D., associate professor of library and information science, of scholarship recipients Burlock and Rogers.  [Andrea Copeland](https://luddy.iupui.edu/contact/profile/andrea-copeland)  “I know Wilma would have wanted to meet them, have lunch at the Indiana Historical Society, work on community projects, and share with them her wisdom – as she in turned learned from them,” adds Copeland, chair and program director of the Library and Information Science Department at Luddy Indianapolis.  [Library and Information Science Department](https://luddy.iupui.edu/departments/lis/index.html)   # Sylvia Faith Burlock  During her career as a high school English teacher, Sylvia Burlock has become an advocate for readership.  “I would give ‘book talks’ and introduce students in my classes to new novels and encourage reading as a hobby,” she says. “I also facilitated discussions after a student read a book to teach how to apply lessons to everyday life.”   ### Teaching led to next step  Later, she implemented a program called discipline literacy in her classroom.  “I purchased newspapers in English, and collected free newspapers in Spanish from my library,” Burlock says, “to have students read nonfiction articles and write responses to current events.  “Through these experiences as a teacher and an advocate for readership, I came to see myself as a future leader in library/information within my organization and community.”  Burlock earned her master’s degree in teaching at IU Indianapolis, and now is earning her M.L.I.S. degree from Luddy Indianapolis. “I know that this program will equip me to become a school library media specialist in the future,” she says.  She credits her local library’s Summer Reading Program for igniting her passion for the written word as a young girl.  “When I was a junior in high school, I created the campus’ first literary magazine and published fiction,” she says. “This exposure led me to want to pursue a career in literature and eventually to become a library media specialist. My conversation with one of the professors in this program gave me the confidence to enroll.”   ### ‘Like it was meant to be’  “Being awarded the Wilma Moore Scholarship is both humbling and exhilarating,” Burlock says.  “It means continuing a legacy of African American librarianship.  “I met Ms. Moore years ago, through my sister, who was then finishing her graduate program in Public History at IUPUI. I could not have imagined that years later I would receive an award in her name. It feels like it was meant to be.”   ### A second honor  Burlock also has been selected to receive an Indiana Library Federation scholarship. She will be presented with the Sue Marsh Weller Memorial Scholarship at the annual ILF conference in November 2023. The scholarship honors a student who plans to use their degree to work with children or youths.  [Indiana Library Federation](https://www.ilfonline.org/scholarships)   # Tamara Rogers  Rogers earned her Juris Doctor degree from DePaul University College of Law.  She also holds a master’s in social work and a bachelor’s degree from Southern Illinois University-Carbondale.  “I have been a lawyer by trade for the past 19 years,” says Rogers. “I was the managing attorney at Rogers Law Firm in Indianapolis practicing estate planning and elder law.  “I also served as a juvenile magistrate judge for five years in Marion Circuit Court in Indianapolis, where I heard paternity cases, including, enforcing or modifying child support, custody, parenting times, and other related family law matters. I spent many years practicing in general litigation.”  But Rogers’ career took a new direction in 2023. That summer, she started her M.L.I.S. studies through Luddy Indianapolis. She’s interested in academic librarianship.  “I returned to school to pursue my M.L.I.S. degree to further assist law students, legal professionals, and the public with their legal research skills and inquiries,” Rogers says. “I also wanted to support user access to law library resources.”  In October 2023, Rogers started her position as a research and instructional services librarian at the IU Robert H. McKinney School of Law. “Within this role, I will teach first-year law students legal research skills, and support patrons with reference and law library inquiries,” she says.  “I am excited to embark on this expanded librarian journey.  “My academic interests include diverse, equal, and inclusive user and patron access to law libraries. I also have an interest in the behavior and best practices of archivists.”   ### A deep connection to libraries  Her connection to libraries goes back to childhood, Rogers notes.  “The public library was my haven growing up on the south side of Chicago,” she says. “Libraries continued as a cornerstone of my development during my developmental and professional years.  “Wilma Gibbs Moore’s legacy resonated with me. She championed preserving Black American history and focused on diversifying the library profession. I also advocate for developing quality diverse and inclusive law librarians and support those archiving such contributions.”     ### About Wilma Gibbs Moore  The Wilma Gibbs Moore Graduate Endowed Scholarship memorializes Moore, whose contributions to the historical record of African Americans in Indiana are well documented.  Wilma Gibbs Moore graduated from Crispus Attucks High School and received her B.S. in sociology and her master’s in library science degree from Indiana University. She worked at Indiana University Libraries, Indianapolis Public Library, and the Indiana Historical Society.  Moore served as editor of Black History News & Notes and was contributing editor of Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History. She received the Award of Merit from the American Association for State and Local History and the Eli Lilly Lifetime Achievement Award for her contributions in the field of history.  Moore died in 2018. She had worked for 30 years as senior archivist of African American History at the Indiana History Center. “Your history is who you are,” Moore told The Indianapolis Recorder in 2013, “and when you get to a point where you somehow discount it or not think it’s important, you really diminish yourself.”  [The Indianapolis Recorder](https://indianapolisrecorder.com/476d1100-81c5-11e2-a88b-0019bb2963f4/)  She participated in a number of local organizations serving the Indianapolis community, among them the Indiana African American Genealogy Group, Indiana Freedom Trails, the Association for the Study of African American Life and History, the Indiana Landmarks’ African American Landmarks Committee, the Neal-Marshall Black Culture Center at Indiana University, and Crispus Attucks High School and Museum.

    "body": "  ## Informatics researcher’s digital image selected for cover of leading science journal  January 29, 2009  A computer-generated image of neurons inside a microscopic worm – digitally drawn by Albert William, research associate, Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI – is on the cover of the most recent issue of Molecular Interventions . The journal, published by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics (ASPET), is among the most respected in the field of medical research.  [Molecular Interventions](http://molinterv.aspetjournals.org/)  The image shows a drawing of dopamine neurons in the small nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Dopamine neurons are the types of cells that die in Parkinson’s disease (PD), and the worm contains similar types of cells found in the human brain that allow scientist to utilize this animal for Parkinson’s disease research.  Editors selected William’s image to visually represent a journal article penned by Dr. Richard Nass, at Indiana University School of Medicine, and Drs. Kalpana Merchant and Timothy Ryan at Eli Lilly and Company, entitled: Caenorhabditis elegans in Parkinson’s Disease Drug Discovery: Addressing an Unmet Medical Need (December 2008 Volume 8, Issue 6).  Dr. Nass, who developed the first C. elegans PD model, generated genetically modified worms that produce a fluorescing protein inside these neurons that allow these cells to be visible in a living animal under a fluorescent dissecting scope. Dr. Nass’ lab utilizes these worms to identify the molecular mechanisms involved in PD-associated cell death, as well as novel therapeutic targets and drugs that may inhibit the neurodegeneration.  “The toxins we use to model Parkinson’s disease work very similarly in the worm as in humans,” explained Nass. “Because the worm is transparent, and because it shares about the same number and types of genes as in humans (approximately 20,000), we should be able to more quickly identify compounds that protect dopamine neurons from dying in the worm, and if they protect in the worm, they or a similar type of compounds may inhibit the cells from dying in the human’s brain.”  How William’s image landed on the ASPET journal cover is the story of a burgeoning collaboration between Informatics and the IU School of Medicine. William was tapped by Nass to create two digital animations of the C. elegans worm – one targeted at physicians and researchers, a second, less complex version aimed at educating the general public, particularly children via Web sites.  “This is a great collaboration between art and science,” said William. “Using digital animations that are scientifically accurate can be a great learning tool, and Dr. Nass’ vision is giving us the opportunity to demonstrate that effectiveness.”  The millimeter-long C. elegans worms are found worldwide living in soil, where they eat vegetable plant mass and bacteria. Three recent Nobel prizes have been awarded in connection with research using C. elegans worms. Still, the organism remains largely undervalued within the medical research community and the public at-large, and Nass predicts the digital visualizations will help introduce this important research technique to a wider audience.  “This has great potential to pay off at several levels,” said Nass. “Albert’s biology and media arts background make him uniquely qualified for this purpose. We also hope to generate additional funding for other, similar types of projects.”  William used Autodesk Maya and Adobe Photoshop software to develop the image and accompanying animation.  Additional information about Albert William’s medical animations is available here. Information about Richard Nass’ C. elegans research is available here.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Bioinformatics research aims to fight diabetes in the Latino community  September 13, 2010  Indiana University and Alivio Medical Center have partnered in a research study that may help identify Latinos genetically at-risk for diabetes. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Latinos –and Latina women in particular — are among several demographic groups at greatest risk for type 2 diabetes.  The study, titled Diabetic Genomic Health , is projected to last one year and will include both clinical and bioinformatics research. The IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI and theIndiana Center for Systems Biology and Personalized Medicine will analyze data from clinical samples collected from Latino patients at Alivio Medical Center, as well as mine existing, large-scale genomic data sets to isolate genetic association patterns for diabetes development.  “With Alivio Medical Center’s support, we intend to use these association patterns in the development of a genetic test that further assesses the hidden links between genetics and diabetes among Latinos,” said Jake Chen, Ph.D. Chen is associate professor of bioinformatics at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, as well as director of the Indiana Center for Systems Biology and Personalized Medicine.  Indianapolis-based Alivio Medical Center is keenly aware of the need for enhanced diabetes prevention, awareness and education services specific to the Latino community. As a provider of high quality, compassionate, culturally-competent and cost-effective healthcare, it sees an average of 18,000 patients annually. Of those patients, approximately 85% are Latinos – a community that often faces cultural and financial barriers that hinder early diabetes detection and treatment.  The center sees the research agreement with Indiana University as an important step forward in diabetes prevention efforts among Latinos.  “Our partnership with Indiana University will have great impact for the Latino community,” said Alfedo M. López-Yunez, M.D., director of Alivio Medical Center. “This research will increase our understanding of the genetic basis of type 2 diabetes, allowing us to not only identify individuals predisposed to diabetes earlier, but also intervene to prevent this prevalent disease’s devastating consequences.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

Many large collections of images, such as surveillance camera data, lack word-based labeling and categorization. Pattern recognition and machine learning is crucial to categorizing and retrieving these images efficiently. Chang’s work has examined not only how to refine such image-based searches, but how to make machine learning more efficient with every search.  A lecturer in our school’s Department of Human-Centered Computing, he’s the author of a published book on using DSP software to develop integrated environment CCS. Chang also has authored and co-authored more than a dozen peer-reviewed journals and conference publications.  [published book](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=zh-CN&u=http://www.bookschina.com/1391397.htm&prev=search)  In 2011, he joined the Energy Dynamics Lab in Utah State University Research Foundation as a research officer. He participated in research projects dealing with moving object tracking, as well as inductive electricity power transfer for electrical vehicles.

    "body": "  ## IU informatics dean honored at White House for advancing tech opportunities for women  December 14, 2011  EDITOR’S NOTE: Watch the Champions of Change event on YouTube. Blogs by each Champion of Change, including Dean Schnabel, can be found here beginning Friday.  WASHINGTON, D.C. — Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing Dean Bobby Schnabel will be one of 12 people honored at the White House on Friday, Dec. 9, for leading efforts to recruit and retain girls and women in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields.  Schnabel and the other honorees will be recognized at the White House as Champions of Change, a program created as a part of President Barack Obama’s Winning the Future initiative. The group includes teachers, industry leaders, students and nonprofit leaders who have each taken great strides to reduce the barriers that drive many girls and women to turn away from high-paying, highly rewarding careers as the nation’s top innovators, according to John Holdren, assistant to the president for science and technology and director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.  “These ‘Champions of Change’ are community heroes, helping to build the ranks of women in the nation’s STEM workforce and ensuring that America’s science and engineering enterprise is fueled by the diverse talents of all of its citizens,” Holdren said. “The bold work of these champions epitomizes the president’s vision of an ‘all hands on deck’ effort by government, academia, nonprofits and industry to maintain America’s leadership in STEM fields for decades to come.”  Schnabel leads a school of approximately 100 faculty members and 2000 students at the Bloomington and Indianapolis campuses, including undergraduate and graduate programs in computer science and informatics.  “Bobby Schnabel has been an outstanding leader and mentor in advocating for education programs at the local, state, regional, national and international level designed to make improvements for girls and women in identifying the rich opportunities that exist in the STEM fields,” said IU President Michael A. McRobbie. “Diverse groups must come together to solve complex problems, and Bobby personifies the spirit of leadership needed to foster and inspire others toward both personal success and the desire to achieve these greater goals that benefit all of society. Indiana University is honored to be associated with a leader like Bobby Schnabel who embodies this spirit.”  Schnabel is co-founder and executive team member of the National Center for Women & Information Technology, a national nonprofit organization aimed at increasing the participation of women and girls in information technology education and careers. He also serves as chair of the Association for Computing Machinery Education Policy Committee and chair of the advisory committee for the Computing Alliance for Hispanic-Serving Institutions, and he was a co-founder of the Alliance for the Advancement of African-American Researchers in Computing. He served as founding director of the Alliance for Technology, Learning and Society Institute at the University of Colorado at Boulder, the headquarters of NCWIT, from 1997 to 2007.  Honorees will spend the beginning of the day at the White House in working groups. They will then attend a Champions of Change event in the South Court Auditorium that will offer networking opportunities, followed by a formal ceremony where guests will offer remarks about their experiences in retaining women in STEM fields. Administration officials will then offer remarks, followed by an on-stage panel discussion with all of the honorees.  “My opportunity to visit the White House with a group of like-minded individuals is simply as a representative of the many talented, dedicated people that I have been fortunate to work with, both at IU and across the nation,” Schnabel said. “I am continually impressed by the commitment of so many people to ensuring that women and other underrepresented groups are provided the opportunity for full participation in identifying and obtaining rewarding careers in computing in particular, and more generally in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. I thank all of these people for their efforts, and Indiana University for its wonderful support of these initiatives.”  In October, IU Bloomington’s School of Informatics and Computing and Computing announced a doubling of the number of women enrolled in computing-related majors over the previous 18 months. That achievement came six months ahead of a self-imposed two-year deadline put in place for doubling women in technology majors.  The enrollment commitment came after the school joined a group of universities and corporations in November 2009 as founding members of NCWIT Pacesetters group. At that time, Pacesetters were asked to lock in a two-year, self-determined goal to increase net new women in computing, and the School of Informatics and Computing and Computing’s goal was an unprecedented doubling of the number of undergraduate women in programs on the Bloomington campus from 75 to 150 students.  Profiles of all 12 Champions of Change will be available here Friday.  For more information, please contact Steve Chaplin, University Communications, at 812-856-1896 or stjchap@iu.edu.

    "body": "  ## Dr. Brad Doebbeling Awarded PCORI Grant to Improve Access to Care  November 22, 2013  Dr. Brad Doebbeling, chair of the BioHealth Informatics Department at the School of Informatics and Computing, and Professor of Informatics, Medicine and Biomedical Engineering, was the recent recipient of a $2million grant through Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI).    PCORI grants are designed to include patients in the discussion of how to improve and expedite medical care.  Dr. Doebbeling and his team are the first ever recipients in Indiana.  In the coming months, he and his team will work with community health centers around Indiana on how to provide better health care in a more timely fashion.  “We were funded to form a collaborative of community health centers from around the state of Indiana to gain a better understanding of how we can improve access to health care in Indiana,” said Dr. Doebbeling. “There are many underserved people in Indiana that should be seen, but resources are a challenge, the providers-the space-the time, to see them and get them the care that they need.”  Dr. Doebbeling and his team are partnering with different community health centers around Indiana to study how patients get into the clinic systems and to engage patients, providers and staff in discussions about opportunities for change and important barriers.  They are looking to uncover best practices and innovations that the community centers have found that work for them on a physician, staff member, or patient level to improve access to care.  “We’re right at the tipping point in healthcare informatics and health system redesign, where we can effectively organize and use the information and data to make better decisions, enabling us to provide more efficient, higher quality health care,” said Dr. Doebbeling. “I’m excited, now is the time to solve those kind of problems. Our country is embarking on a grand experiment to work within existing insurance plans and delivery systems to expand care to the uninsured.  There is tremendous data and info available that we need to utilize to provide better, safer and more efficient and effective health care.” This is exciting to us because it’s a real partnership between patients, providers, staff, health systems, and researchers all working together to solve access to care problems.”  PCORI aims to provide information with the best available evidence to help patients and their health care providers make more informed decisions. The PCORI research is intended to give patients a better understanding of the prevention, treatment and care options available, and the science that supports those options.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## LIS-S 554 Library Systems  3 credits  [schedule](https://sisjee.iu.edu/sisigps-prd/web/igps/course/search/)   ### Description  The ILS (Integrated Library System) is still the most important component in an automated library. In S554, you explore the mechanics of the traditional ILS and become familiar with its modules through a series of hands-on exercises in global system configurations, circulation, cataloging, OPAC, serials, and acquisitions. You learn how to categorize your library’s collection and its users in order to create circulation rules that you will use to conduct library business. Much time is spent on populating your virtual library with a variety of records. You also examine library technological standards and related issues involved in implementing, migrating, reporting, and protecting library systems. As a result of current trends in technology and how services are delivered, the traditional ILS is rapidly evolving as well as competing with certain web-based technologies in order to meet patrons’ needs in a more collaborative and interactive manner.   ### Program Learning Goals Supported  Instructors map their courses to specific LIS Program Goals . Mapped program goals drive the design of each course and what students can expect to generally learn.  [LIS Program Goals](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/masters/mlis/program-goals.html)   ### Learning Outcomes  Instructors develop learning outcomes for their courses. Students can expect to be able to achieve the learning outcomes for a given course after successfully completing the course.   ### Course Overview  Instruction is in Canvas. Lessons are organized into Modules whose length may vary.  Module 1: Introduction to the integrated library system This Module introduces the typical Integrated Library System Module ILS: and its products, both proprietary and open source for academic, public, school, or special libraries. Some perspective is given on the historical ILS marketplace and its evolution during the past 40 years.  Module 2: Setting up global system preferences for an ILS To prepare an ILS and make it work as you want for your situation, you have access to system preferences Module e.g., MARC flavor, date format, templates, etc.:. Many default preferences are set, but you are also able to personalize how a particular system works.  Module 3: Configuring item types You begin on how to set up and configure an ILS. This period concentrates on ILS item types for a library. Item types differ per library, and per the type of library Module public, academic, school, special, etc.:. Item types comprise both physical and virtual holdings of a library.  Module 4: Configuring patron types You develop the concept of ILS patron types for a library. You define patron categories and patron attribute types Module identifiers and statistical categories: for patron records, depending on the users of a particular library type.  Module 5: Determining circulation and fines rules You define circulation and fines rules for combinations of libraries, patron categories, and item types. You also examine item circulation alerts: Define rules for check-in and checkout notifications for combinations of libraries, patron categories, and item types.  Module 6: Cataloging In your library ILS development, you examine the cataloging module, how to get MARC records, and how to manipulate these records and their display. You start to build our collection in the library for future circulation practice.  Module 7: Cataloging and cataloging standards; MARC, Z39.50; Authorities You continue to work on the cataloging module, using a Z39.50 client to access MARC records. You also examine the issues of Interlibrary Loan for libraries and how you can use other library resources with your own ILS.  Module 8: Acquisitions You explore a typical ILS by examining the Acquisitions module and how it is related to Cataloging and other components. You will use budgets and funds in the ordering process.  Module 9: Serials: You explore further a typical ILS by examining the Serials module for materials that are received on a predictable pattern. You \"catalog\" serials but in a different manner than non-repeating resources.  Module 10: Circulation You examine the Circulation module of an ILS and how to deal with patron registration issues. You create a patron base and use it to circulate items from our collection.  Module 11: Serving the patron; Patron accounts and enhanced content For our ILS, you explore the features that will allow us to integrate trending technology with our existing system. You cover the impact of social networking in a typical ILS and how to manage it.  Module 12: Relational databases and reports: SQL reports and guided reports The ILS database is demystified. You study the concept of the relational database and how it can be addressed by SQL. You also examine GUI report generating. You construct useful reports with both canned and ad hoc reporting features.  Module 13: Statistics wizards For a typical ILS, you explore the ILS statistics wizard feature to see how our database can provide an overview of library activity. Statistics are essential to any library, but you also discover how statistics can mislead.  Module 14: ILS migration Extracting data once it is in your system is a major consideration. You look at how data was entered into the system and prepare the database so that the extraction is not corrupt. Migrating your data into a new system involves correct mapping. You will resolve this issue for your ILS.   ### Policies and Procedures  Please be aware of the following linked policies and procedures.

    "body": "  ## In memoriam: Professor Katherine Schilling  March 18, 2016  It is with deep sadness that we share the news of the passing of our colleague and friend, Professor Katherine Schilling.  “This is a great loss for all of us,” said Executive Associate Dean Mathew Palakal. “On behalf of the School of Informatics and Computing, we extend our deepest condolences to Kathy’s family.”  A memorial service will be held at 1 p.m. Saturday, April 2, at The United Presbyterian Church of New Kensington, Pennsylvania. Read the obituary from The Valley News Dispatch .  A professor in the Department of BioHealth Informatics at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, Schilling also held an adjunct appointment at the IU School of Nursing. Her expertise and background were in health informatics, health information, and health sciences librarianship. During her 12 years at IUPUI, Schilling was professionally active across a wide range of organizations that include the Indiana University Simon Cancer Center, the Walther Cancer Foundation, and the Regenstrief Institute.  Before coming to IUPUI in 2004, she served as as an academic health sciences librarian at the University of Pittsburgh and at Boston University Medical Center, where she specialized in information literacy and information management. During this time, she developed information-focused curricula and programming with several schools at both institutions.  Throughout her career, Schilling was active in the Medical Library Association and the American Medical Informatics Association, and she was a senior member of the Academy of Health Information Professionals (AHIP)—the professional development credentialing program of the Medical Library Association (MLA). She served as associate editor of the Journal of the Medical Library Association (JMLA) and was a consultant on the MLA’s Health Information Literacy Program for the promotion of patient-self management through hospital librarianship and clinical partnerships.  Schilling was a very active member of our School, serving on various committees—most recently as the secretary of the Faculty Council. As those who knew her will attest, she was witty and insightful conversationalist and colleague. In recent months, serious health challenges limited her energy and involvement at the School.  “With a heavy heart and deep sorrow, we say good-bye to a great friend, colleague, teacher, and mentor,” said Professor Josette Jones, director of Health Informatics in the Department of BioHealth Informatics. “We will miss her dearly.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

Faiola visited Russia to explore research opportunities and later met Huang in China to talk to students about what the School of Informatics and Computing has to offer.  Faiola, who lived and taught in Russia during the 1990s, began the trip with visits to Moscow and St. Petersburg, Russia, and Tallinn, Estonia. While there, he gave several presentations on his current research to Russian faculty and graduate students at Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and Tallinn University. This was followed by Q&A time to discuss both his research and invitations to prospective students to apply for graduate studies in the School of Informatics and Computing.  Faiola and Huang then met in Hong Kong, where the primary focus of their trip was on recruitment. They traveled to Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU) in Guangzhou, China to discuss the 2+2 undergraduate program with faculty and prospective students in the School of Design and Communication and the School of Information Management. In the 2+2 program, SYSU students study for two years in China, then complete their junior and senior years with the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI.

    "body": "  ## School of Informatics and Computing Graduate Students Complete Care Unit Analysis for Mental Illness  June 17, 2013  The School of Informatics at IUPUI and White Pine Systems, LLC (dba SPINN), a leading provider of patient engagement solutions, announced that a team of Health Informatics graduate students has completed the Mental Health Care Unit (MHCU) analysis, proposing requirements for technology-enabled patient engagement that will improve operating efficiency and outcomes.    The MHCU analysis explores the challenges of treating people with addiction and mental illness and considers how online and mobile patient relationship management tools can improve outcomes and lower cost in community-based mental and addiction health programs.  Treatment of bipolar disorder, major depression, panic disorder, OCD and schizophrenia have been shown to improve health at rates that compare favorably to treatment of asthma & diabetes, cardiovascular disease and heart disease, yet fewer than one third of people with mental illness receive treatment. In some states, fewer than 10 percent of the people who need addiction treatment receive it, mostly as a result of limited access to care and stigma.  Recognizing the potential for online and mobile technology to help meet this need by expanding access to care and reducing stigma, Centerstone of Indiana and Recovery Consultants of Atlanta (RCA) asked White Pine and the School of Informatics to conduct the MHCU analysis.  “This is our third Care Unit project with White Pine and the School of Informatics at IUPUI,” said Linda Grove-Paul, Vice President for Addiction and Innovation Services at Centerstone of Indiana. “In the fall of 2011, we heard about White Pine’s success helping clinicians and patients in physical health. So we asked them to conduct a Care Unit Analysis for substance abuse. That system is now live and showing tremendous value in improved operating efficiency and health outcomes.  The next area that needed to be addressed was mental illness, “We heard about Centerstone’s success with the Substance Abuse Care Unit and called White Pine to see if they could help us with our population in Atlanta,” said Cassandra Collins, RCA’s Executive Director. “As a major urban center with a large homeless population, we simply can’t help all of those who need and want our services. Also, many of our people experience mental illness, so we know that the Substance Abuse Care Unit alone will not be enough for our community. This MHCU analysis is helping us figure out just how to address that.”  Mental illness poses unique challenges and opportunities, specifically around literacy levels and attention capacity. Through the MHCU analysis, a configuration of tools was developed that used info graphics—pictures instead of words—and doles the discussion out in bite-sized chunks that are easier to digest. “This is truly innovative work that has real promise of contributing to the Triple Aim.” said White Pine’s founder and CEO Doug Dormer.  For the past 5 years, the School of Informatics has worked with White Pine following their Care Unit Method. “Each semester, we have two teams of graduate students participate in these projects. So far, the teams have conducted analyses for Care Units including diabetes, hypertension, pregnancy, breast cancer, substance abuse, palliative health and Parkinson’s disease,” said Dr. Josette Jones, Associate Professor of Health Informatics at IUPUI. “Our students tell us this is one of the best projects in their graduate studies.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## MAS game design and development student receives Best in Show award  June 18, 2019  Alexander Douglas (above center), a senior and recent graduate of the Media Arts and Science undergraduate program , took home Best in Show for his game, Labrunner, at the 2019 Vector Conference held at Eastern Kentucky University in late April. Vector is a game conference held in collaboration with EKU Gaming Institute and RunJumpDev that celebrates local developers and features networking with peers and industry experts in game design and development. Douglas received a $250 check for his award.  [Media Arts and Science undergraduate program](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/undergraduate/media-arts/)  [2019 Vector Conference](http://vectorconf.com/)  Douglas’ development team included Torrie Dearduff, an IUPUI alumna, and Noel Keith, also an MAS student. Dearduff textured most of the background and was the character modeler on the project, while Keith was in charge of various sound effects and all of the music in the game.  He minored in Informatics at the IU School of Informatics and Computing after choosing to focus on 3D modeling and game design within the MAS major. “I felt that if I was going to go into an artistic field I might as well go into the field I was most passionate about and interested in. That’s why I chose to focus on 3D modeling and game design. I had gotten a bit of game design practice throughout high school and had always envied the ability to create 3D models digitally,” Douglas said.  Douglas had multiple roles for the project as lead project manager, lead Unreal Engine (Epic Games) manager, background asset modeler, character animator, and audio composer. He did everything in Unreal, including coding, level-design, audio mixing, and animation mixing. Douglas says he learned an immense amount of skills from this as an independent study and learned even more in game design as a Capstone project. Most of the background models for Labrunner were modeled by him during his independent study version of the game and were textured by Dearduff. He was also in charge of all the animations for the characters. Douglas rigged the skeleton to the character models of every character in the game and did animations for all of the non-human creatures; all the human character animations were taken from Mixamo.  In the first iteration of Labrunner, which he had done for an independent project, Douglas says he unfortunately put too much focus on the tech side of things and less on the design. This led to a highly functional but uninteresting experience through 15 procedurally generated drab levels. So, for his Capstone project he decided to revive his independent project and this time focus on the issues he had found with the first project’s design and throw nearly all his efforts into the design of the game.  The first biggest issue he had to face, design-wise, was how to eliminate the confusion of a procedurally generated level. Next was to fix the grating platforming sections the game had. And the third biggest issue was the pacing of the game. Douglas says he revolved everything around these three aspects and turned Labrunner into what it is today.  He credits Travis Faas , lecturer in the Media Arts and Science program for allowing the Labrunner project to exist. “He gave the green light for me to start with this as an independent project several semesters ago, despite the fact I had only taken a few game design courses. To add to that, despite the lackluster feedback of the original design of the game, he allowed me to improve upon this project for my Capstone,” Douglas said. Faas also guided Douglas on aspects to focus on and how to manage his time, and gave insight on expectations after graduation. Douglas also appreciates Albert William , lecturer in the MAS program, for his knowledge in 3D modeling, texturing, and animating.  [Travis Faas](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/travis-faas/)  [Albert William](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/albert-william/)  Douglas is hoping to market himself to as many companies as possible in Indiana, saying that because media arts jobs are not advertised as much here as in LA or Seattle, he will need to get his name out there. His advice to others is to “Be aware of the skills you yourself have as a gamer and design, not to test those skills, but to teach those skills to others. Designing to test those skills will come when players fully understand your game.”   ### About Labrunner  Labrunner is about a janitor who is working in a secret underground government facility that has been taken over by a mad scientist. The janitor (the player) is being held captive and is forced to run through a series of challenges for the mad scientist’s amusement. The game plays as a first-person-shooter, with an emphasis on platforming, shooting, and a light emphasis on puzzle solving. Watch a video clip of Labrunner .

    "body": "  ## School of Informatics and Computing’ Mannheimer patents acoustic interface  August 19, 2010  Steve Mannheimer, M.F.A., a professor of media arts and science at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, was recently awarded a patent for an acoustic interface process and system.  The interface allows users to navigate large amounts of information using audio cues, thereby reducing dependency on visual or alphanumeric prompts traditionally used to organize data. Users arrange information in customizable, tiered categories that are assigned audio cues for ease of navigation down to the specific file sought, which could include audio, video, text or any number of other file types.  All data and corresponding audio cues are collected in a storage device that can be accessed using a handheld device and integrated with a home entertainment, car stereo or other sound systems.  The acoustic interface is designed to appeal to individuals for whom aural memories and recollection are stronger or more preferred than visual or linguistic cues. It could also have utility for the blind and visually-impaired.  Mannheimer began work on the interface nine years ago while working in the new media services division for Thomson Multimedia, Inc., where he collaborated on patentable technologies and applications. Thomson Licensing has been assigned patent rights. Co-inventors listed on the patent include Barry Weber, Kerry Calvert and Jonathan Griffin.

The information, technology, digital and media literacy skills that are the basis of our information science “curriculum” are taught most effectively when they are imbedded within classroom standards-based curriculum rather than taught as isolated lessons. The activities for this course are meant to both help you become familiar with the content, but also to give you various opportunities to participate in brain-compatible instruction techniques. The course is taught from a predominantly constructivist perspective meaning you are expected to “construct” learning with your instructor and classmates rather than be an idle participant. In addition to the instructor role, school librarians must be fiscal agents, publicists, free speech and ethical use advocates, collection developers, professional development coaches, student and teacher empowerment agents, and visionaries. Group discussions will be designed to stimulate your thinking, not provide all the answers. Most importantly, this course emphasizes the teacher librarian as a professional responsible for curricular leadership with the school community. It is no longer acceptable for a school librarian to “fly under the radar.” Rather, this role requires cutting-edge thinking, vision for what is possible but unknown or untried, and the tenacity to take educated risks.   ### Program Learning Goals Supported  Instructors map their courses to specific LIS Program Goals . Mapped program goals drive the design of each course and what students can expect to generally learn.

Travis Faas, Media Arts and Science faculty member who coordinated the competition, explained the challenge this year was for participants to investigate issues related to “transit”, and then design and implement a prototype solution for those issues. Some of the problems they may have tackled included access to transit, car emissions, or planning commutes.  The top winner of the competition, representing Terre Haute South High School, designed and built a ride-sharing application that let people match not only on commute, but also on personal preferences of the drivers, such as music tastes and shared interests.    The Mobile App UX Competition is sponsored by the Department of Human-Centered Computing. Members of the top three teams received cash prizes and are eligible for scholarships to attend the School of Informatics and Computing.  Winning teams were from Terre Haute South HS, first place; Warren Central HS, second place; and Columbus North HS, third place.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## MAS graduate student creates seamless online experiences for Walmart shoppers  January 6, 2020  When Xiaochen Yu arrived at the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, she was led by a determination to prioritize her instinct to hone her artistic skills to the next level. After gaining a background in human-computer interaction as an undergrad and working for some time as a visual and website designer, Yu came to the realization that something was missing.  Parallel with her growth as a problem solver through design thinking, Yu says she had always been seeking resources, hoping to “spread out the very sensation that arts bring to me.” After viewing the holistic list of the courses offered in the program as well as chatting with Media Arts and Science (MAS) alumni, she immediately knew that her instinct had been on point and that enrollment in the MAS master’s program was an opportunity to expand her skills through the lens of what state-of-the-art technology could unfold.  “Regardless of how much I committed to the mission of job searching, the inner voice would always remind me of a seed I planted into my head—I make arts.”  Besides the areas she was originally interested in, ranging from digital illustration to animated graphics to video production, the discourse in MAS has exposed her to a broader playground in the digital media industry in conjunction with the demanding tech field. “MAS has well prepared me as a well rounded product designer who understands the multiple facets of crafting a delightful and immersive user experience beyond digital interfaces,” Yu says.  Joseph Defazio, director of the MAS graduate program, says Yu is and was an outstanding student. “I cannot speak highly enough about her. She was a stellar student in every way and I would encourage others to emulate her zeal, passion, knowledge, and perseverance.”  In the summer of 2019, Yu interned at Walmart Design as a UX designer, working with a cross-functional team to re-envision creation of a seamless user experience for the Search and Browse space on Walmart apps. “This professional experience raised my creative confidence as a junior designer, in which I collaborated with domain experts in design, research, and analysis to iteratively finalize design decisions,” Yu said. She also gained a great amount of quality time for professional growth, including networking, team building, and workshops for knowledge sharing, which offered her a taste of the professional work field and a welcome to the career she was looking for.  Yu says she recommends MAS to anyone having a passion for pursuing a career at the intersection of multimedia production and emerging technology. In the career-focused MAS graduate program, she says she has “had a lot of opportunities to collaborate with local companies and communities on projects to gain industrial experience. With the flexibility of curriculum planning, it’s a fantastic program to utilize the value of an interdisciplinary education to pave the way for a broader domain in technology.”  On top of everything, Yu says, the amazing faculty and staff provides students with incredible mentorship and resources to help shape their education and career. She says the project-based courses she took, despite being challenging, introduced her to the redefined craftsmanship in emerging fields. For example, in an Advanced Visualization class she was encouraged to prototype her creative ideas in Unity, a tool for testing AR and VR. “It couldn’t be more motivating to realize that it’s the era, that we, the creators, are gifted with the best toolbox—the sky’s the limit,” Yu says.   ### About the MAS program  The thirty-credit-hour MAS graduate program emphasizes both quantitative and qualitative design, development, and applications, and can be completed in as little as one-and-a-half years. Participants will expand their media arts skill set to include UX, UI, UXD, strategy, project management, teamwork, and critical thinking, in preparation for career advancement.

Albert William and Thomas Lewis, both lecturers in media arts and science at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, accompanied ten students on this seventh trip to Greece, and the fourth visit to the island of Paros.  William blogged about the lessons that Paros has taught him and the group. “It is always a learning experience—from all of the small interactions with the warm, friendly people, to the many places I discover every year. I also see our students increase their awareness and their wisdom based on what they’ve learned here on the island in the same way,” he wrote.   ### Documentaries  Students and faculty explored Paros Park, the Environmental and Cultural Park of Paros, on this trip. Paros Park spans an 800-acre peninsula with great geological and historical importance, and welcomes visitors year-round.  View Paros Park—An Ecological Sanctuary  The group also documented farming practices on the small Mediterranean island. Agriculture is approached a bit differently there and has an impact on islanders and tourists alike.  View Feeding Paros—A Recipe for Farming   ### Matterport® Scans  The students used a Matterport camera, a first for the Paros study abroad visit, and captured a variety of 3-D spaces, including an archeological museum, a church baptistery, and a pottery workshop.  Archeological Museum  Baptistery of The Church of 100 Doors  Church of Taxiarchis  Ancient Pottery Workshop  Yria Ceramics     ### Interviews  The island visitors also recorded interviews with residents of Paros—and found some unexpected stories. Alcey Childers spoke with local tour guide Avgi Kalogianni, Matt Marret learned about the craft of traditional Greek shoemaking, Renee Cook discussed contemporary ceramics with artisan Stelios Ghikas, and Jack Salazar met—wait for it—former Olympic snow skier Sophia Mystrioti.

    "body": "  ## IUPUI announces winners of Ideas Solving Social and Economic Challenges student ‘pitch’ competition  March 7, 2013  INDIANAPOLIS — The IUPUI Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research recently announced the winners of the second annual Ideas Solving Social and Economic Challenges student “pitch” competition.    The competition encourages IUPUI students to come up with innovative ideas to solve real-world problems through new approaches, products, services or ventures.  Two of the three 2013 ISSEC winners are from School of Informatics and Computing. Their degree programs and innovative solutions are:  First place, $2,500: Brittney Parker , School of Informatics and Computing, Media Arts & Science Penny Saver-Shopping Budget App : A smartphone application that allows people to track their total at the grocery store while scanning items in to their carts.  3rd Place, $500: Dominic Rigsby (also Audience Award winner, $1,000 ), School of Informatics and Computing, Human-Computer Interaction Map-ivate : A community-driven mobile application that allows a user’s phone to adapt to surroundings and social environments using GPS and Fields with little to no interaction from the user.  The competition’s structure allows students three minutes to present to judges their concept or solution, without the benefit of slides or other props. According to Karen White, Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research, research, development and commercialization facilitator and competition moderator, this “elevator pitch” format teaches students to tell their story, in a concise and persuasive manner, at a moment’s notice.  “This experience was an amazing opportunity and feeling,” Parker said. “I pitched my idea to many family and friends but of course they will be encouraging and say it’s amazing. But to actually be able to tell a bunch of people that had never heard my idea and get the feedback I did was amazing. After I pitched my idea I actually had someone find me on LinkedIn to talk about it. I actually have better goals to get this idea off the ground and running.”  A panel of expert judges from the IUPUI campus selected winning pitches to receive the awards.  “I was surprised by and delighted with the scope of ideas presented, inspired by the passion of the presenters and impressed with the preparation opportunity of ISSEC,” said Ann Wilson, a judge for the competition. “The process of the competition, start to finish, provides every participant with tools they will need to effectively present their ideas to potential funders and investors.”  Derrick Braziel, a local entrepreneur who also served as a judge, said, “I expected for many of the ideas to be under-developed, and unrealistic, but many of the ideas were not only shovel ready but had the capacity to change the world. I hope that one day I can say that I had a part in the success in many of these projects.”  The pitches from 12 finalists included a wide range of potential products, new ventures or nonprofit projects.  “This contest provided an excellent opportunity for our students to demonstrate their agility in problem-solving by helping us understand informatics and particularly the impact of computing on our lives every day,” said Tony Faiola, School of Informatics and Computing executive associate dean.

Thomas Lewis, Media Arts and Science Lecturer, Chronicles Battle between Man and Nature in Video Installation Exhibit at Indianapolis Gallery  January 23, 2013  The School of Informatics and Computing’ C. Thomas Lewis, a lecturer in Media Arts and Science, photographer and filmmaker, will be exhibiting his video installation, From Now On , during the month of February at Gallery 924 in Indianapolis.    From Now On is a thought-provoking video-mapping experience studying the struggle of man versus nature and exploring the tensions between nature and industrialization. According to Gallery 924, “Lewis’ depictions of the forces at play in climate change are placed in visually compelling, dynamic relationships that delight the senses as they raise questions regarding the future. From Now On offers hope in the form of a dead tree that appears to come alive with moving imagery and becomes a metaphorical image of human knowledge and beliefs.”  Lewis’ work is uniquely customized to the exhibition space. Unlike static works of art that are more simply installed within a gallery, From Now On evolves and adapts to the specifications and possibilities inherent within the space. It includes a deceased, twelve-foot maple tree that Lewis disassembled, transformed and reconstructed into a visual display surface organically situated within the gallery. The exhibit also includes a three-dimensional moveable wall surface that, through multiple video projections, creates various illusions and images when viewed from all sides.  Gallery 924 is an Indianapolis art gallery and home of the Arts Council of Indianapolis located at 924 North Pennsylvania Street. It provides a mix of exhibits highlighting central Indiana contemporary artists. For more information on the gallery, please visit www.indyarts.org/gallery924.  C. Thomas Lewis studied at Kent State, the Philadelphia College of Art, and the California Institute of the Arts. He has worked professionally in video and film production in Los Angeles. Since 2001, Lewis has produced DVD bonus material for the Harry Potter films produced by Warner Bros. In 2005, he completed Through Corridors and Factories , a 20-minute video about post-colonialism in Hawaii that screened in festivals around the world. Other works include Got Land , a video about time, space and development in the American west, and his first narrative film, Of Fire and Water . In addition to filmmaking, Thomas is the photo-documentarian for Arcanum Research, an organization dedicated to the research of inexplicable phenomena.

    "body": "  ## Health Informatics student’s simulation piloted by Franciscan Health  April 26, 2019  Ashley Leising’s Electronic Medical Record (EMR) project, for which she built patient records for training nurses, is currently being tested by Franciscan Health for use in their sim lab. Leising, a graduate student in Health Informatics at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, has also been invited to deliver a presentation about her simulation project at the Epic XGM (Expert Group Meeting) Conference in May.  [Health Informatics](https://luddy.iupui.edu/biohealth/graduate/health-informatics/masters/)  Leising, who has a degree in psychology and originally studied to be a nurse, is employed by Franciscan Alliance in Beech Grove as an Information Services Educator while working on her master’s degree. She gained an understanding of EMR design, build, and structure, as well as security and confidentiality, in her health informatics courses.  The simulation or “sim” lab, where nurse training is conducted, is a common practice in teaching hospitals such as Franciscan. Participants have the opportunity for hands-on experience of medical procedures before interacting with live patients. Conversely, EMR training is typically given in a didactic or classroom environment. Based on her experience, Leising recognized that nurses did not have adequate preparation for documenting care during an actual patient procedure.  Using her informatics skills, Leising worked with the sim lab supervisor and staff to develop and integrate training modules for patient code, stroke, and adverse reactions to chemo. She then evaluated nurses’ simulation performance with and without the aid of the EMR, and compared results pre- and post-training. The EMR training reduced the time for the nurse to interact with the EMR and provide better patient care, making them more efficient, Leising said.  As a result of her work, Leising was invited to present her project to the Franciscan annual nursing practice showcase, to the IS division management, and to the Chief Information Officer at Franciscan. She also submitted her project proposal to Epic, the EMR provider, which resulted in her being one of 74 submissions chosen to be presented among 40 organizations nationwide.  Leising’s project results have sparked an initiative within Franciscan Health to standardize and expand EMR and simulation integration over the next one to two years throughout  Franciscan’s 13 hospitals. Knowledge sharing through platforms such as XGM, could lead to additional adoption as a solution for many health care organizations.  Josette Jones , Ph.D., Health Informatics program director and Leising’s advisor, remarked on how Health Information Technology (HIT) has changed nursing practice for the better. In addition to safeguarding the core nursing meta-paradigm constructs of “patient, health, and nursing ” , HIT requires nurses to first focus on the structure and algorithm of data, information, and knowledge used by nurses and, second, capitalize on technology to support and expand care beyond the formal healthcare settings. “Nurses lack the formal training in information systems, databases, and information technology security to answer the demands HIT poses.  Health informatics professionals are well versed in those skills and competencies through their education; the collaboration and supportive functions provided by health informaticians to nurses when using HIT is a perfect fit,” Jones said.

    "body": "  ## SoIC professor’s $499,941 IMLS grant focuses on rural libraries for STEM outreach  November 16, 2022  Not all children have access to STEM learning opportunities. But most have access to a public library. A professor at the IU School of Informatics and Computing (SoIC) in Indianapolis is helping to connect the two.  [School of Informatics and Computing](https://luddy.iupui.edu)  Soo Hyeon Kim , Ph.D., an assistant professor of library and information science at SoIC, is studying how to work with public libraries to offer elementary-grade engineering education. Her research project, “ Family Makers : Online Engineering Program for Underserved Children and Caregivers at Rural Libraries” received a $499,941 grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) this year.  [Soo Hyeon Kim](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/soo-kim/)  [Family Makers](https://www.imls.gov/sites/default/files/project-proposals/LG-252377-OLS-22-full-proposal.pdf)  [Institute of Museum and Library Services](https://www.imls.gov/)  Kim is the principal investigator; co-PIs are:  [Andrea Copeland](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/andrea-copeland/)  [Department of Library and Information Science](https://luddy.iupui.edu/lis/)  The University of Cincinnati is a key collaborator in this project. Choi will lead the design of the online engagement and facilitation, collaboratively conduct research activities, and develop the materials for dissemination.  This IMLS grant will strengthen rural libraries’ capacities for outreach educational programming and culturally relevant engineering programs for underserved children (5-10 years). “We expect the project will enhance children and caregivers’ engineering interest and participation and also support rural library staff to develop online facilitation skills and understanding of engineering design thinking,” Kim says.   ### Strengthening rural libraries is key  Kim researches ways to help socially marginalized groups learn about science, technology, engineering and math.  “Children’s career aspirations towards—and away from—engineering start as early as 10,” the research team noted in its IMLS proposal, which is why they decided to focus on engineering. “It is critical to provide opportunities to understand what engineering is from an early age.”  “Rural districts are often excluded from federal initiatives and lack resources to implement engineering curricula,” Kim says.  “However, we argue that rural libraries, the only public institution that provides free learning resources, can address this challenge by positioning them as hubs to broaden engineering participation.”   ### Centers for informal learning  During the three-year project researchers will work with eight rural libraries, each from a different state (including one in Indiana). Through research-practice partnership, the library partners will co-design and co-facilitate the online engineering programs.  “Dr. Kim’s research is of particular importance to the field as there is an increasing expectation that libraries of all types will acquire new expertise and resources support to informal learning,” notes SoIC’s Andrea Copeland, who serves as program director for the school’s Department of Library and Information Science.  “Further, librarians are being called upon to facilitate learning in libraries through instructional design and community collaborations. Her work is well-positioned to advance our understanding of the potential for public libraries to meet communities’ informal learning needs.”   ### Engineering that’s relevant to rural children  The project team will co-design curricula for six online programs, then test and revise the material by implementing the program at the participating libraries.  Kim and the research team will develop and disseminate ready-to-use, open-source digital content for the online engineering program.  “Underserved children, especially those living in rural communities may find engineering unrelatable or unachievable,” Kim notes. “Culturally relevant and contextually appropriate engineering learning curriculum is needed for children in rural communities.  “From this research, we hope to leverage rural engineers’ narratives and lived experiences as resources for engineering learning.”  Kim adds, “We expect that when children connect with rural engineers who are like themselves, they are more likely to find relevance and engage in engineering activities in the future. We will also center on children’s everyday making practices and use them as legitimate learning resources for engineering.”   ### STEM learning as a family activity  Caregivers will be important learning partners in this program.  “Family Makers engineering program is a family activity,” Kim says.  “We expect that caregivers’ participation in online programs can increase their confidence to support children’s future engineering interest.”  To help families participate in the online engineering programs, the research team will provide hotspots, tablets, craft supplies, and technology guides.  Kim notes that 80.5 percent of public libraries are rural and small-town libraries and about1.5 million rural children live in poverty.  “Providing a new outreach educational programming that overcomes barriers to serve underserved rural children will directly make a national impact,” she says. “I am excited to explore ways to position rural libraries as a key institution to democratize engineering learning opportunities for children.”   ### About the Institute of Museum and Library Services  The Institute of Museum and Library Services is the primary source of federal support for the nation’s libraries and museums. It advances, supports, and empowers America’s museums, libraries, and related organizations through grantmaking, research, and policy development.

    "body": "  ## Building a Bridge with 3D Printing  June 22, 2015  by Devan Himstedt  The Herron School of Art and Design will open IUPUI’s first-ever 3D printing lab this fall.  But before the grand opening, this summer a group of about 20 students from the Herron School of Art and Design and the School of Informatics and Computing (SoIC) got a sneak peak in a 3D printing course.  The two schools are collaborating in what might seem to others a competitive opportunity – the goal to create a more well-rounded education for all IUPUI students.  With the promise of access to the 3D printing lab, the School of Informatics and Computing program in turn recruited Herron students to enroll in a 3D modeling class that took place this summer. Students learned the 3D software and then had a chance to print the objects they’ve created, according to Zeb Wood, the professor of the class and a lecturer in the Media Arts and Science program at SoIC. Though the lab is not yet officially open, the class will be able to use the lab to fine-tune their skills by the fall semester of 2015.  With the addition of the $1.3 million 3D printing facility, called the “Think It Make It Lab” (TIMI Lab), many feel that the relationship between the two schools will only grow stronger, says Julie Reagan, academic advisor for the School of Informatics and Computing. Within the last year, a Studio Art and Technology minor was developed and approved. The minor incorporates classes from both Herron and Informatics and Computing, and is available to students from either school. Reagan hopes that this, along with the TIMI lab, will encourage students to broaden their education by taking advantage of what each school has to offer, thereby strengthening their skill sets, and better preparing them for their future career.  The TIMI Lab will include state of the art 3D printers, precision laser cutters, and a 3D scanner, according to Herron. Instead of keeping the lab open exclusively for Herron students, there have been several partnerships created to let students of many different disciplines have access to this resource. According to Herron, their partnership with Informatics and Computing is one of many future collaborations.  Kevin Jethrow, a student in the class, says that the best thing about the lab is that you can “virtually make anything.” As a student in the Media Arts and Science program, with a special interest in environment design for video games and digitized worlds, the ability to physically create what he’s designing will be a huge step forward. Since taking the 3D class with Herron students, Jethrow is considering taking Illustration classes through Herron and maybe even pursuing the Studio Art and Technology Minor to help round out his figurine and set design skills.  In addition to Jethrow’s printed landscapes and characters, students’ project plans in the 3D class included printed fashion pieces, sculptures, and shadow art. “Of the two projects in the class, one was a commercially focused product suitable for marketing and the other project was completely open-ended,” says Professor Wood.  During the class, students helped each other and bounced ideas back and forth, which is an exciting thing to witness as a professor. Wood is looking forward to what this collaboration between schools might bring. He says that it’s neat to see the Media Arts and Science students help the Herron students with the software and technical issues while the Herron students offer conceptual design ideas to their peers. The mix of different skill sets is causing students to challenge each other to think about design in new ways.  “When two schools collaborate, awesome things can happen,” Reagan says.

    "body": "  ## Bioinformatics Club wins Inclusivity Award  April 22, 2019  The Bioinformatics Club at IUPUI (BCAI), which represents students in the BioHealth Informatics Department at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, was chosen to receive an Inclusivity Award at the 2019 IUPUI Student Organization Awards on Monday, April 22.  Jiannan (Johnny) Liu, the club president, said, “Winning the Inclusivity Award really excited our club members. It is the first award we have won since the establishment of our organization a year ago and all members feel honored by winning this award. I think this award can be regarded as a recognition of our successful internal management strategies. I hope the next generation of our organization management team could take our tradition and do a better job of serving the IUPUI community.”  According to Liu, the club has four main missions: To help bioinformatics students or students in any other majors make improvements in both their academic life and career life; to anonymously gather suggestions, ideas, and dissent from students and convey through proper channel to the faculty or staff members; to create a platform for individuals in the bioinformatics community to communicate effectively among one another; and to broadcast academic events, student-life activities, and other major events on and off campus.  Official BCAI members must be bioinformatics master’s and Ph.D. students, but all events the club hosts are open to all students campus-wide.  Since its establishment in mid-2017, the club has promoted various events. Last fall, club members joined the Regatta boat racing with a team named “Bioinformatics Club at IUPUI”, set up a table in SoIC’s lawn party to recruit new club members, and successfully built an official Facebook page with hundreds of followers. All these efforts were made to strengthen the impact of the club as well as their events.  The club’s core management team has tried to create a self-organized student organization where every member in the club can express ideas about the event planned. To prepare for the event, every member is assigned his or her own tasks to complete; core management team just needs to approve the tasks and oversee the events. The club has successfully hosted several events in this manner.  BCAI has already built a signature event series called Lighten-Up that is very well recognized by the BHI Department and students and that has successfully delivered professional knowledge, skills, and experience to students. Topics for the Lighten-Up series included “Young generation professor” to which the club invited Dr. Chi Zhang, a young professor who joined IU School of Medicine two years ago. Zhang gave a talk on the experience of being a professor in an academic field and how students can successfully prepare to be a professor.  The club also presented “Genome Browsers”, to which they invited Rajneesh, a senior Ph.D. student in the BHI Department who is a professional on genome data analysis. Rajneesh gave a talk on how to use main genome browsers and tricks to use when applying those technologies.

Emeritus Professor, Media Arts and Science   ### Contact  smannhei@iupui.edu IT 500  [IT 500](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=535+W.+Michigan+St.+Indianapolis+IN+46202-3103)   ### Education   ### Biography  Steve Mannheimer began teaching at the Herron School of Art at IUPUI in 1976. In 1982, while maintaining his teaching duties, he began an 18-year stint as the visual arts writer for The Indianapolis Star. In 1985, and later from 1992-2000, he served as president of the Mid-America College Art Association. He also has been involved in the civic promotion of art, having directed several large-scale public art projects in Indianapolis, including the memorial to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Sen. Robert Kennedy in the city’s King Memorial Park.  [King Memorial Park.](http://kennedykingindy.org/the-park/)  In the summer of 2000, he took a two-year leave of absence from IUPUI to become a full-time employee of Thomson Multimedia, Inc. Within Thomson’s New Media Services division, Mannheimer was part of a multi-disciplinary team developing new media business concepts, strategies and technologies. His team worked in collaboration with other Thomson divisions and other research facilities around the world. Mannheimer’s work at Thomson led to a U.S. patent for an acoustic interface (a system for using non-speech sound cues to navigate large databases), as well as more than 20 patent disclosures filed either individually or as part of the team.  After returning to IUPUI in 2002, Mannheimer joined the Media Arts and Science program in the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering. Since then, his research has focused on improving access to information for the blind and visually impaired. This work has been supported by grants from the Nina Mason Pulliam Charitable Trust, the National Science Foundation, Google Research Awards, the IU President’s International Research Awards and other charitable institutions.  He has presented his research at national and international conferences, including CSUN (California State University – Northridge) Assistive Technology Conference, and the 2018 world conference on Movement and Cognition at Harvard Medical School.   ### Research Interests   ### Related News "

    "body": "  ## Luddy helps teachers prepare students for a tech-driven job market through CxD workshops  February 22, 2023  When teachers feel empowered and excited about computer science, their students benefit.  Luddy Indianapolis is working with Indiana public school instructors to expand opportunities in their classrooms. More than 420 different teachers from 307 schools in 71 Indiana counties have benefited from its Computing by Design (CxD) Teachers Training Program, funded by the Indiana Department of Education.  The 2022 workshops alone had 207 registrations—the largest number since the program began three years ago.  Participants praise the hands-on workshops, with one noting, “It was set up to create actual projects for us to use in our classrooms.”  Summer CxD sessions are among free workshops Luddy Indianapolis provides for the hundreds of public school teachers who are expanding computer science in their classrooms  “Teachers are ‘forever students,’ and I feel more connected with my students when I am learning and teaching skills relevant to the world we live in,” noted one 2022 participant.  “It is essential to our learners that we keep learning, too!”   ### Meeting the challenge of evolving tech  In 2019, the state announced it would require elementary, middle, and high schools throughout Indiana to offer at least one computing course to every Hoosier student by fall 2021.  To proactively meet the need for expanded computer science education, Luddy Indianapolis presented its Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce (iDEW) curriculum to the Indiana Department of Education, which funded the school’s teacher training program through two grants.  The summer CxD workshops have been offered at no cost to participants thanks to the IDOE grants and support from TechPoint, Indiana’s statewide technology business initiative.  Computing by Design workshops prepare teachers to offer computer science classes at their schools, enabling them to help their students acquire knowledge and skills that can lead to better job opportunities The workshops are conducted largely online through IU’s Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering in Indianapolis.  “The exploration was phenomenal,” said one 2022 participant. “I’ve learned about so many great tools I can use for my computer science courses.  “I also enjoyed just meeting other CS teachers.  Many of us are the only CS teachers in our building.”  “I really loved this workshop,” said another 2022 participant, Janine Patterson, a math teacher at Terre Haute South High School. She came in with a knowledge of computer languages r and Python, and wants to learn Java as well.  “I double majored in college … math ed and computer science.  But it was so long ago, CS has changed.  “This workshop gave me the motivation to continue to learn more about all of these languages,” she said. “I will definitely be empowering my students to learn more as well!”   ### Project-based learning  Preparing students to become curious, confident problem-solvers means exploring the tech all around us, at work and at home: AI, the Internet of Things, video gaming, data visualization and more.  The 2022 workshops guided teachers on how to use fun, project-based lessons to help students develop skills that employers are seeking. Activities include charting data; creating a trivia game or chatbot; and building a robot or flip card app.  “I loved the wheeled robot workshop,” one participant said, “and I know my students will create amazing inventions.”  Instructors also learned about classroom management, and how to assess student projects. “I like that we designed lessons specific to our classrooms,” said another participant.   ### A lasting resource  While funding for the summer CxD workshops has ended, material for teachers will continue to be available online, through Luddy Indianapolis’ iDEW website. This resource allows teachers to help their students develop tech skills to prepare for the future, and what it may hold.  “The CxD workshops were designed to provide tools for teachers of all experience levels to offer innovative, project-based learning experiences for their students,” says Vicki Daugherty, iDEW program manager.  “Of the teachers who participated in 2022, 63% had little to no experience with computer science,” she notes, “and 70% of that group reported some worry in their ability to be successful. In the end, only one teacher reported the workshop wasn’t a good fit for their needs.  “In our experience, teachers willing to challenge their students to learn along with them have some of the greatest success.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Tim Carney Alumni Spotlight  January 24, 2020  Dr. Timothy Carney (Ph.D, Health Informatics, 2012) is the Associate Director for the Office of Informatics and Information Resource Management (OIIRM) for the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP). He is responsible for the strategic direction of technology in the center and for oversight, operations, development, and security of information systems that support programs and grantees. Tim was kind enough to share his remembrances of his early work with the CDC, how his experience there lead him to the Health Informatics Program at SoIC, the current exciting work he does for the CDC, and the future he envisions for the field of Health Informatics.  “I first entered the field of Public Health Informatics as a Public Health Informatics (PHI) Fellow at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,” Carney remembers. “I entered the program as part of the third official cohort of myself and five other outstanding scholars in 1998 and graduated in 2000. After graduation I was hired on to work within the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP) at the CDC for seven years as an informatics specialist. I focused on supporting NCCDPHP advance its efforts in the area of informatics through understanding complex informatics and health IT related topics impacting on chronic disease information systems and surveillance activities. I had a great fortune of working on projects related to cancer surveillance, health disparities information systems data warehouse for better management of state and local grantee projects, HIPAA, data sharing across NCCDPHP programs, health IT architecture, and health informatics strategic planning efforts.”  This early experience at the CDC inspired Carney to seek out a new career path in the field of Informatics. “Once I decided I wanted to pursue doctoral studies in informatics in support of developing a more complete informatics portfolio of training and experience to open up career avenues in teaching, research, program management, and leadership, the choices for PhD programs in informatics were limited to only a few outstanding programs. I narrowed my search down to three great programs and then following a one-on-one conversation with the then Director of the Informatics Program at IUPUI, Dr. Anna McDaniel, I was assured that everything I wanted to do was in alignment with their program objectives and could achieved through their program. She answered all of my questions, was extremely flexible in making the program fit my continued demands at the CDC related to ongoing projects, and fought hard to get me selected as the first Indiana University-Anthem Indiana Health Information Exchange Pre-Doctoral Fellow. The combination of academic rigor, informatics research opportunities, and maturity of the program made it stand out from every other program I had explored. I had tremendous support along the way. I enjoyed mentors at every step in my career that challenged me, counseled me, and guided me to be my best. Dr. Anna McDaniel, Dr. Josette Jones , and Dr. David Haggstrom are just a few instrumental in helping me to carve out a program of study and research that proved impactful.”  [Dr. Josette Jones](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/josette-jones/)  Carney continued his work on projects at the CDC during the first year of his studies at IUPUI, and following his graduation was asked the rejoin the center where he first entered the field of Public Health Informatics. “I now serve in the chair once held by one of the strongest supporters of my informatics career at CDC named Jeanne Gilliland. Jeanne was the first director of CDC/NCCDPHP/OIIRM and recruited me to her center once I graduated. She also helped make my transition from CDC to IUPUI extremely efficient.” Carney now leads this center as Associate Director for OIIRM. “I am building on (Gilliland’s) legacy of supporting NCCDPHP and each of its eight Divisions in all areas of informatics, information technology, and surveillance. We support the CDC’s current efforts in advancing Data Science, Informatics, and Information Technology through its current agency-wide Data and IT Modernization efforts. Our OIIRM team’s role is to ensure that the center is best able to leverage this technology in support of program goals and objectives both for internal NCCDPHP operations and all of its external programs of engagement across all states and territories. The CDC as an agency and NCCDPHP as a center represent some of the most elite scientists and public health professionals. My job, and that of the great team within OIIRM is to simply provide them with the best informatics support possible to assist in their efforts to improve chronic disease outcomes for all.”  Carney believes informatics will be an essential force in helping to shape the world of the future. “I am really excited around the explosion of the consciousness of the everyday appreciation for terms like A.I., machine learning, and complex systems. We are entering a time in which the use of these concepts, and the corresponding changes in education can transform the youth of today into a workforce of tomorrow that has tremendous potential to solve problems we have struggled with for decades. Their appreciation for how technology can transform lives is heightened and the means to transform both healthcare delivery and public health practice, coupled with the growing number of informed and engaged youth demanding change the way in which we govern all sectors of our society and care for our planet brings with an air of transformational leadership that has the potential to do phenomenal things. Fields of study like informatics (by any name such as Data Science or whatever the terms of the day are) can help provide them with avenues to help bridge science, technology, and purpose.”  To the students who will help shape that future, Carney has the following advice. “Find your path and walk it with integrity. Failure is part of the process…find ways to leverage advanced knowledge in a discipline like informatics to showcase how you can be a change agent for transforming healthcare delivery and public health practice into what you want it to be in 2050 and beyond. That will mean finding creative ways to wear many hats at times that includes, informatics scientist, computer engineer, social and organizational behavior specialist, change management consultant, program and policy analyst, health services researcher, and community leader. Informatics is by its very nature multi-disciplinary and the problems we typically solve are complex enough to warrant such a perspective. Work in your labs, build your algorithms, publish your findings, design your code, and cement your position as a leader in your field, then find innovative and creative ways to implement that change over time.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Alvin and Nadine Givens Donor Spotlight  December 3, 2020  Alvin and Nadine Givens have each seen significant success in their respective fields: Alvin, a graduate of Kelley School of Business, began his career as a commercial banker focused on technology companies and has recently become an expert in the sub sector of software companies that are embedding payments into their software as a second revenue source; whereas Nadine has risen to the senior ranks of the banking field as Marketing Director at PNC Wealth Management. Both have leveraged their professional successes into involvement with organizations focused on making positive changes in their communities.  Alvin’s prominence in the Indianapolis tech community lead to him becoming involved with the School of Informatics of Computing at IUPUI when he was asked to serve as head of Corporate and Institutional Giving for the School’s first Campus Campaign, where he got to know a number of SoIC’s senior staff and administrators. While working to determine the needs of Indianapolis-area IT businesses, Alvin and SoIC Executive Dean Mathew Palakal sparked the idea for what became iDEW, the Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce project, which works with high schools in inner-city Indianapolis as well as corporate partners and foundations to provide STEM education to high school students, providing a pathway to colleges and universities as well as exciting careers in IT. Alvin served as advisory board chair during the first years of the iDEW program as it grew and expanded. He and Nadine continue to serve iDEW students studying at SoIC through the creation of the Alvin and Nadine Givens iDEW Scholarship. I had the opportunity to speak to Alvin and Nadine about their paths to success, their involvement in the Indianapolis community, the iDEW program, and the creation of their scholarship.  A native Hoosier, Alvin recalls that his early experience working with technology came during his time in the military. “I grew up in rural Indiana near New Castle,” says Alvin. “I joined the Navy out of high school where I repaired electronic communications equipment and ships guidance information equipment.” Following his military service, he earned his degree in finance from Indiana University, and this finance background as well as his technology training from the Navy gave him a unique skill set, and he has spent the last 20 years of his career using this skill set to improve and innovate financial services for a number of growing tech companies. Alvin has been involved in the Indianapolis community for over 20 years as a member of TechPoint board dating back to 2000, as a co-founder of a Neuro Rehab Research Institute that is a partnership between Rehabilitation Hospital of Indiana and the IU Medical School and is an NIH Model System, and he spent 6+ years as the co-head of an initiative to grow Healthcare IT companies in Indiana called ALHIT.  Nadine had also grown up in a small town, in her case in central Florida. She recalls, “[I] put myself through college working at a bank in my hometown. I attended Florida State University and Miami of Ohio. After graduation I met my Hoosier husband in a training program at The Northern Trust Bank in Chicago.  I grew to love Indiana when we would visit his family. I appreciate the sense of community and the genuineness of the people.” As the Givens family settled in Indiana and advanced their way through their respective fields, both saw the importance of investing time to improve their community. Nadine has served on boards of directors for organizations like United Way, College Mentors for Kids, Indiana Repertory Theater, Walther Cancer Foundation, WFYI, and the 500 Festival, among others, and has been recognized by the Indiana Business Journal as a “Woman of Influence”.  While meeting with heads of Indianapolis-area tech companies in support of SoIC’s Campus Campaign, Alvin and SoIC Executive Dean Mathew Palakal asked about their concerns and needs for the future. Alvin remembers, “Two major themes kept surfacing: one, the future of the workforce, and two, the future of opportunities for inner city youth. Mathew and I put two and two together and co-founded the iDEW concept and name. The staff at IUPUI SoIC was fully onboard and dug in deep to create curriculum and to build partnerships with area inner city schools.” In his role as Chair of the iDEW Advisory Board, Alvin was instrumental in gaining corporate support for the project. “I recruited some of the best technology and diversity minds in Indiana to join an advisory committee.  This committee did an excellent job of being liaisons and provided vital and timely feedback to the school during the creation and launch of the program.”  The program is now in its sixth year, serving eight area high schools and over 1,680 students, and Alvin is thrilled with how the program has progressed. “This opportunity to supply Indianapolis with a Informatics and Computer Science workforce with a diverse and inclusive local talent has been a home run,” Alvin says. “This was one of those ideas that was so obvious and yet it needed a home and IUPUI, and in particular Mathew and his staff, not only gave it a home they have built a nationally recognized and award winning program.  More importantly the students are already entering the workforce and beginning to fulfill the dream—an “Information Technology-Diversity Enhanced Workforce.”  Following Alvin’s leadership of the iDEW Advisor Council, Alvin and Nadine determined an additional way to assist iDEW students. “Once the program was up and running we realized that after completion of the iDEW progam and high school there would be a funding gap for many of our students whether for first dollar in assistance for other funding or scholarship opportunities or last dollar assistance; says Alvin. “Neither the school nor the IU Foundation at the time had a specific fund set aside for iDEW graduate scholarship assistance.  My wife, Nadine, and I decided to create such a fund that would allow others to follow.  It has been a very rewarding experience for us.” For Alvin and Nadine, diversifying the IT field not only leads to improvements in the lives of inner-city high school students, but to improvements in the IT field as well. Alvin states, “The creation of software programs is drawn from the way the creator(s) view usage of the software product and therefore how it is used.  If the majority of the creators are from one or two ethnic groups or one gender this leaves all users with a narrow the lens of content and user interface.  By expanding diversity into the ranks of the creators of software and user experience we begin to invite more users in and build a path for a more inclusion.” In providing support to iDEW students, the Givens’ have helped build this path. “Nadine and I have been fortunate in our careers and were able to put our children through college.  However, we both put ourselves through school and know how distant the opportunity is for many families and students to even be able to try to put themselves through school.  Supporting iDEW students with scholarship funding has been very rewarding as there is nothing greater than giving a motivate young person the tools that leads to a career and fulfillment of dreams. “   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

The students—pictured with Richard Tapia (back row, center)— were accompanied by iDEW Program Director and Executive Associate Dean Mathew J. Palakal , iDEW Program Manager and Diversity Coordinator Vicky Daugherty, Outreach Coordinator and iDEW Program Assistant Tina Rice, and Career Services Specialist Pat Rhodes, all of the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI.  [Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce](https://luddy.iupui.edu/idew/)  [Mathew J. Palakal](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/mathew-palakal/)  The goal of the Tapia Conference is to bring together undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, researchers, and professionals in computing from all backgrounds and ethnicities. Conference attendees celebrate the diversity that exists in computing and connect with others from similar backgrounds, ethnicities, disabilities, and gender. Attendees are also inspired by great presentations and conversations with leaders with backgrounds similar to their own.  The iDEW students were the youngest in attendance at the conference. Other attendees complimented the iDEW students for being tech savvy and for displaying abilities on par with those of older students. The students were also able to see themselves represented in the underserved students, faculty and industry professionals attending the conference. “I am glad I was given the opportunity to attend the conference because now I know what to expect in college in regards to preparing for a job in computing and I have an idea of what to expect in the workplace,” said one Arsenal Technical student.  The conference exposed the students to the many unique ways in which computing and technology shape the way people live, work, play, and communicate. While in Atlanta, the students also met with representatives from several companies, including Google, CNN, and Facebook, and visited several local colleges and historic landmarks.  The iDEW students showed tenacity and the desire to expand their IT intellect as they sat through plenary and breakout sessions that were sometimes more advanced that what they had previously experienced. They drew from those instances and shared their thoughts during the group’s recap sessions. “I am genuinely glad and grateful for the iDEW program and the opportunities it has offered me. This has literally been a life-changing experience for me,” said a Pike student. A Providence Cristo Rey student said, “Being able to experience the Tapia Conference has made me even more determined to get a degree in the STEM field.”  The  iDEW program creates a direct pipeline of students pursuing post-secondary IT education or IT employment after high school graduation. Attendance at conferences like Tapia widens and deepens the students’ IT experiences, which is key to the iDEW program’s success and goal of serving as a model for future programs of its kind.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Luddy 3D Print Lab  The Luddy Indianapolis has a 3D print lab located on campus for Luddy students, faculty, and staff to print 3-D objects for class or personal projects. The lab is equipped with 4 Makerbot printers including 2 Z18 large format printers.   ### Getting Ready to Print  The cost for printing is 20 cents per gram. All users should have a 3D model file (*.STL, *.OBJ). The 3-D print lab staff offers one-on-one consultations to help finalize your model for printing. One-on-one consultations are required for the first print.   #### 3D Printing Guidelines  Please follow these steps to ensure that your 3D print is successful.  Creating Your Model  All 3D models must fit these requirements to to be 3D printed.  Printing an Existing Model  Whenever you find something you’d like to print, always check for instructions on how to print the model. People will often provide recommended settings and other details about the print in the instructions.  If you’re worried that a print may not be successful, or if the instructions recommend checking the print object, then be sure to review the “Guidelines for Your Model” above or express your concerns to our consultants. Consultants will be able to verify whether an object will print successfully or not.  Print Settings  Layer Height determines the overall resolution of your print. Lower layer height creates higher quality prints but takes an extensive amount of time to print.  Infill refers to the material printed inside of the model. Prints with lower infill are structurally weaker but are cost and time efficient. Higher infill percents are structurally stronger but use more grams of filament and take longer to print.  Shells increase the durability and strength of your print. Printing with more shells will increase the material used for the print and increase time  Don’t forget to pick your color! The Luddy 3D Print Lab currently provides the following filament colors: white.  [Submit a request form](https://iupuisoic-fireform.eas.iu.edu/online/form/index/3dprintrequests)  Users are responsible for responding to inquiries from Luddy staff regarding their designs. Lack of timely response may result in delay or cancellation of print requests.   ## How Long Does It Take  The time it takes to print your models depends on the size, quality, and detail of the model you are printing. Printing can take anywhere between a couple of hours to several days depending on the print time and amount of models in the queue.   ## Contact  Email our 3D lab consultants at infotech@iupui.edu with any questions about 3D printing.

    "body": "  ## SoIC professor’s AI paper appears in The Lancet Digital Health  May 12, 2022  By its nature, medical imaging does not deal in externals. X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans can detect broken bones, infection, or internal bleeding. But radiology professionals cannot determine a patient’s race from their medical images.  However, artificial intelligence can. And that is raising concerns related to equality in health care.  Saptarshi Purkayastha , Ph.D. and director of health informatics at SoIC, is a co-author of a paper examining how AI is altering the way we look at medical scans. “Reading Race: AI Recognizes Patient’s Racial Identity in Medical Images” has been published in The Lancet Digital Health .  Prior studies have shown AI is able to determine the race of patients from their medical images. In this paper, the researchers investigated various methods that deep learning models might be using to identify race.  “Our published work in the Lancet Digital Health is a call to researchers to focus on research to explain how AI makes decisions in medical imaging,” Purkayastha says, “and prevent any possible unknown harms.”   ### A collaborative effort  Co-authors on the paper from the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI are Purkayastha, who is an assistant professor of data science and health informatics, and John L. Burns, an adjunct lecturer in health information management; Ph.D. student in health and biomedical informatics; and director of informatics for the department of radiology and imaging sciences at the Indiana University School of Medicine.  Purkayastha leads a talented team of researchers at the Purkayastha Lab for Health Innovation at SoIC. They explore innovations in health informatics, including radiology information systems, as well as biomedical data analysis, mobile health, and electronic health records.  He’s also affiliated with the Data to Action (DATA) Lab at the School of Informatics and Computing.  Purkayastha has worked as a consultant to ministries of health on behalf of the World Health Organization (WHO) in South-East Asia Region for the implementation of health information systems in countries including Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, and North Korea.   ### AI and medical imaging  Why is artificial intelligence examining medical images to begin with?  It comes down to diligence.  Software developed using deep learning models can act as a second set of eyes, analyzing images for anomalies and detecting potential problems that a human radiologist might miss.  But as Purkayastha and the paper’s other authors demonstrate, once an AI system is given data that correlates race to a set of medical images, the algorithms can develop the ability to categorize other medical images by race as well—something a non-virtual radiologist cannot do.   ### Disturbing possibilities  This ability raises serious concerns among some researchers. Such software might group patients, or influence their care, by factoring in race. These types of categorizations could lead to inequality in providing health care and making recommendations.  And medical professionals might not even be aware this is happening.  “If an AI model secretly used its knowledge of self-reported race to misclassify all Black patients, radiologists would not be able to tell, using the same data the model has access to,” the paper’s authors note.  The paper’s other authors are affiliated with the Mayo Clinic; Massachusetts Institute of Technology; University of Adelaide; University of Toronto; Arizona State, Emory, Florida State and Stanford universities; and the National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan.  They include Imon Banerjee, Ananth Reddy Bhimireddy, Leo Anthony Celi, Li-Ching Chen, Ramon Correa, Natalie Dullerud, Marzyeh Ghassemi, Shih-Cheng Huang, Po-Chih Kuo, Matthew P. Lungren, Lyle Palmer, Brandon J. Price, Saptarshi Purkayastha, Ayis Pyrros, Luke Oakden-Rayner, Chima Okechukwu, Laleh Seyyed-Kalantari, Hari Trivedi, Ryan Wang, Zachary Zaiman, Haoran Zhang, and Judy W. Gichoya.  “Deeper understanding of bias in AI algorithms is necessary to make them trustworthy.”  Saptarshi Purkayastha Director, Health Informatics, SoIC   ### How is it doing that?  Exploring how AI is able to identify race from medical images is a challenge for researchers, as they seek to develop ways to guard against algorithmic bias and provide equal access to medical care.  “As soon as we discovered this issue,” Purkayastha says, “a number of researchers from across the world have come to us with possible experiments to go deeper into identifying the causes of such high accuracy of AI in using race as a conduit to make clinical decisions.”  The paper’s authors explored potential explanations for how these deep-learning models are able to determine the race of patients based only on their scans. It’s especially puzzling because even experienced medical imaging professionals are unable to make such determinations.  They were able to rule out a number of possibilities for race detection, including how race correlates to factors such as underlying disease distribution.  The researchers have determined the ability of the AI-powered algorithms to identify race from scans persists, even when images are cropped, or of poor quality. And it holds true even when various body parts are scanned.   ### “An enormous risk”  “Our findings that AI can trivially predict self-reported race—even from corrupted, cropped, and noised medical images—in a setting where clinical experts cannot, creates an enormous risk for all model deployments in medical imaging,” the authors note.  Purkayastha recognizes that even as the research has eliminated some potential explanations, it also raises new questions.  “The impact of our findings presented in this paper has posed a challenge to medical AI researchers,” he says, “that deeper understanding of bias in AI algorithms is necessary to make them trustworthy.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## C. Thomas Lewis Donor Spotlight  July 11, 2019  C. Thomas Lewis, M.F.A, is a lecturer of Media Arts & Sciences at the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI. He has newly established the IUPUI Media Arts and Science Capstone for Social Change Scholarship, available to MAS students interested in creating capstone film projects that encourage social change. Lewis talked to us about what lead him to establish the scholarship and what he hopes it will accomplish.  “I was thinking about the video program one day and what I could do to further benefit my students, while also encouraging more socially conscience filmmaking in the program.” Lewis remembers. “I guess my two years as co-chair of the awards committee unconsciously came to bear, because it suddenly occurred to me that I could do this by funding a scholarship toward a very specific purpose. I teach a course during the spring semester called Video for Social Change. It is one of my favorite courses and yet sometimes it struggles to fill. This might be due in part to a certain percentage of video students not considering their filmmaking potential in terms of creating socially aware, cause-driven projects. I wanted to create a scholarship to demonstrate that the video program values and encourages this type of work.” Lewis has long seen the potential for video production to help enact social change. “I firmly believe that filmmaking can effectively raise awareness of the important issues of our day and potentially effect change. I also believe our video program has a great track record of students with remarkable talent. The trick for MAS to realize a greater potential for effecting change is to better align the two; so that we start to see a critical mass of talented students focusing their efforts on exploring the potential of film to impact lives in meaningful ways. That is the intent of the scholarship.”  Lewis’s own recent filmmaking projects illustrate this commitment, and his experiences making them helped lead to the idea for this new scholarship. “In my recent years at SOIC, I have been concentrating my filmmaking efforts in Kenya and also in Scott County, Indiana to make films with local communities to address various health concerns. In the case of Kenya, it was HIV disclosure and HIV stigma. In Scott County, it is the impact of the opioid crisis. In each case, I have seen local community members take stock in what we are doing. And that positive engagement has solidified my belief that these are valuable experiences for students who are involved in the work. Bringing students into the production or post-production of these films has provided them with a strong taste of the type of filmmaking that can embolden a community. My hope is that this helps students realize that they too can create their own impactful work to address important issues. The scholarship aims to help support theses types of films.”  Lewis explains the criteria for the IUPUI Media Arts and Science Capstone for Social Change Scholarship as follows: “Students must apply for the scholarship with a proposal for a capstone film project that encourages social change. This can be either a documentary film or a narrative film. The recipient will be chosen by the awards committee. We are currently working out the specific details of the application process. Once finalized, students will be able to find the scholarship on the SOIC website where all the other scholarship opportunities are listed.” If are interested in learning how to contribute to this scholarship, or if you would like to contribute to SoIC in another way, please contact SoIC’s director of development Stacy Zearing at szearing@iupui.edu.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Mosaic Fellowship changes classroom learning dynamics for faculty and students  July 16, 2019  Last summer, Todd Shelton, lecturer in Media Arts and Science (MAS) at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, learned he had been selected as an IU Mosaic Faculty Fellow for the 2018-19 school year. Shelton applied because of his interest in active learning and different ways he could engage the students. He had already experimented with the Lightboard in his online classes and wanted to add more engagement to his classes.  Fellows who take part in the Mosaic Initiative active learning classroom learn new ways to teach through reading, research, and monthly meetings with a cohort of other Fellows. Shelton said that each time they gathered in a new room, they were asked, “What would you do with this?” The objective was for participants to compare lecture (didactic) approaches with interactive approaches that promote more active learning and to bring back and implement ideas in their own classrooms, he said.  Active learning classrooms can transform dynamics between and among teachers and students and allow more accessible and egalitarian communication.  Instructional strategies can include high tech, but don’t necessarily exclude low tech, Shelton said. Some options the Fellows experienced included moveable furniture like desks and pods, moveable whiteboards, screen sharing and huge monitors, and Zoom meetings with large cameras and microphones. Shelton mentioned observing large lecture halls equipped with rotating chairs that permitted a change in layout as another example of how to leverage classroom space.  On completion of the program, the Fellows are given a stipend to enhance their own teaching through conference travel and research. Seniors, who are alumni of the Mosaic Faculty Fellows program, are invited back to talk to new entering cohort classes, receive email updates on new research into active learning, and receive support from the Mosaic community. There is also an annual Mosaic Symposium.  Shelton, who is teaching introduction to mobile applications and intermediate web design this summer, said that his involvement with Mosaic has changed the way he thinks. “I didn’t realize it would be so engaging or how getting students to be more active in class with hands-on or group activities could increase their learning outcomes,” he added.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Women in Technology at IUPUI planning Third Annual Networking and Career Day  January 3, 2013  Women in Technology (WIT) at IUPUI is planning the Third Annual Women in Technology Networking and Career Day to be held at the IUPUI Campus Center on Tuesday, March 26. Women in Technology (WIT), a recognized IUPUI student organization, is dedicated to empowering, inspiring and developing female leaders in computing and technology. This free event features local employers, roundtable discussions, student poster sessions and flash talks as well as an invited keynote speaker.    WIT and the March 26th event are supported in part by a Symantec Student Seed Fund grant made possible through the National Center for Women in Information Technology (NCWIT). According to NCWIT, groups encouraging women in technology are much-needed. Women occupy more than half of all professional positions in the U.S., but only one-fourth of all computing-related occupations. And women make up only 11 percent of corporate officers at Fortune 500 technology companies. Furthermore, women earned 18 percent of all computing-related degrees as recently as 2009 – a significant drop from 1985 when women earned 37 percent of all such degrees.  Why is this a problem? With IT being one of the fastest-growing sectors of the US economy, over two-thirds of these positions could go unfilled due to an insufficient pool of qualified candidates. Women represent an untapped talent pool. Further, companies with the highest representation of women on management teams have a 34% higher return on their investment than those with few or no women represented.  WIT hopes to significantly build its membership across all undergraduate and graduate programs on campus, including informatics, computer science, engineering and more. Benefits it plans to offer its members include mentoring, networking opportunities and research resources, as well as community outreach projects. It also plans to continue building strong, supportive relationships with local employers and female IT leaders.  For more information about WIT, how to become a member and the March 26th networking and career event at the IUPUI Campus Center, please visit www.iupui.edu/~getwitit.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Sports Analytics grad student, DJ McCall, excels on court and off  February 8, 2018  IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI student Desmond (DJ) McCall was selected to the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) Honors Court as a student-athlete for 2016–17. The NABC recognizes men’s collegiate basketball student-athletes who excel in academics, acknowledging the talents and gifts they possess off the court and in the classroom.  McCall, a starting small forward and team captain for the IUPUI Jaguars, completed his undergraduate degree in August 2017, finishing in 3 years, and started his graduate studies in Sports Analytics through the Accelerated Five-year B.S. + M.S. Degree program at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI.  Students in the Accelerated Degree programs can finish their bachelor’s degree in a number of disciplines at IUPUI and then go on to complete their master’s degree in a total of five years—saving time and money—and begin their careers with a leg up. McCall, a red shirt junior on the team, is on track to receive his M.S. degree in December 2018, a semester early.  “I decided to take on the Sports Analytics program because as a student-athlete and big sports fan, I felt like it was a perfect fit and no-brainer for me to apply my athletic knowledge with my technology computing background in terms of my undergraduate studies,” says McCall.  The Sports Analytics B.S. + M.S. degree is jointly offered with the IU School of Physical Education and Tourism Management (PETM). Students first complete a B.S. in Sports Management through PETM, then finish with an M.S. in Applied Data Science with a specialization in Sports Analytics. “The benefit of this program is that I will be prepared to work in analytics even if it isn’t in sports,” says McCall. “The “Dream Job” for me right now would be a database administrator for an NBA team.”  McCall is thankful for the understanding of faculty and students when he has had to travel for games. In fact, McCall notes that his studies have been enhanced by his athletics, and vice-versa. “I was very surprised by the amount of students and teachers that are interested in basketball and also other sports. Also, as a student in analytics, I have been able to improve my game play just by looking and focusing on the statistics, numbers, and data drawn from games,” he says.  When McCall is not on the court or in class he can be found mentoring high school students in the Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce (iDEW) program. “As someone who was introduced to programming in high school, I believe that high school students having opportunities to learn about technology is really important. As a mentor, I really enjoy helping with showing the students around campus. I also enjoy supporting the students outside of the classroom by attending their athletic events,” he says. McCall also participates in the Jags Reading Club with other student-athletes, and the IUPUI Paws Pantry.  Pat Rhodes, Career Services Specialist at the School of Informatics and Computing and one of McCall’s instructors, says, “Desmond is one of the most selfless individuals that I have met. He is always willing to give back to others and is dedicated to earning his degree. I’m so grateful to have had the experience of interacting with Mr. McCall and I look forward to hearing about all the awesome accomplishments he will achieve in the future.”  McCall credits his instructors, particularly Todd Shelton, Angela Murillo, Stephanie Marshall, and Rhodes, for his success in the classroom and his decision to study database administration. He points out that although he worried about it before he got to IUPUI, he has never changed his major.  His advice to other students considering the Accelerated Degree program? Stay focused, work hard, take it a semester at a time—and look for opportunities to learn outside the classroom.  Update : McCall, who graduated with his M.S. in Applied Data Science, was drafted in 2019 as a guard by the Fort Wayne MadAnts, where he is gaining real-world sports analytics experience.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Informatics student’s dream of Imagineering at Disney comes true  September 21, 2022  IU School of Informatics and Computing (SoIC) at IUPUI student, Emma Parker has turned a childhood goal into reality through the Disney College Program (DCP) and the Disney Professional Internship. She is working towards her major in Informatics with a focus in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), currently in her last semester, and will graduate in December 2022.  Parker chose SoIC because she felt like she would thrive in an environment with smaller class sizes and lots of hands-on experiences. “I felt like being in Indianapolis would open doors for internship and professional growth and expand my options for what I could do after graduation,” she says. After taking all the Computer Science classes her high school had to offer, Parker decided she wanted to continue studying technology. Her teacher pointed out that she worked well with people as well as computers, so he introduced her to Informatics. “The idea of taking my interests in technology and my people-skills and melding the two together to transform information into knowledge seemed like a perfect fit for me. I appreciate how broad a field Informatics is and how many different careers it can apply to,” Parker says.  She is currently interning with Walt Disney Imagineering Research and Development as an Advanced Development Immersive Experiences Intern where she helps in assisting R&D project teams by prototyping software to be used in mockups, visualizations, concept development, playtests, and communication of new experience concepts and technologies for Disney theme parks, resorts, and experiential entertainment worldwide. She says Walt Disney Imagineering is known for making the impossible possible through innovative storytelling, and she works with an incredible team that is focused on creative directing, writing, and producing. Parker assists them by listening to their ideas and then figures out how to make it possible. Whether it be through researching the best way to make an application, creating project blueprints and feature lists, or designing project mock-ups, her job is to take her knowledge in HCI and do the research and organization to help take her team’s big ideas on to the next steps.  Parker’s internship has also been filled with lots of networking opportunities, exploring Disney Parks and resorts, and other fun activities. She primarily works in Orlando, FL while most of her team is based in Glendale, CA. This has allowed her the chance to travel to the WDI Campus in California as well as travel to other places in the US to meet and connect with Walt Disney Imagineers in all sorts of roles.   ### “A dream is a wish your heart makes”  “It has been my dream since third grade to work for Walt Disney Imagineering,” Parker says. As she got older, she learned about the Disney College Program. The Disney College Program is an internship where college students get to work for Parks and Resorts in The Walt Disney Company. The DCP allows students to gain on-the-job experience, learn professional development skills, and network while working for one of the world’s most admired companies. Parker aspired to be a part of the DCP because she believed it would be a good way to get her foot in the door with the company.  Parker applied her freshman year and was denied, but she reapplied her sophomore year for a program in Spring 2022 and was accepted into the program. She took a semester off school and moved down to Orlando, but her program was cancelled only six weeks after it started due to the pandemic. Parker came back to school and caught back up on her degree, so she decided to take another semester off and reapply as soon as they opened the program back up in 2021. She was back in Orlando in August 2021, and was working in Magic Kingdom at the Main Street Bakery Starbucks. She enjoyed her time so much that she decided to extend her program and ended up staying in the College Program until June 2022.  While on her program, Parker took part in an event called “Tech Behind the Dreams.” This event was a full day of networking and learning about how Walt Disney Imagineering implements the latest technology throughout Walt Disney World. Since she attended this event, she was able to provide Walt Disney Imagineering her contact information for future hiring reference within the company. As her DCP was nearing its end, a Disney recruiter reached out and said that after looking at her background, they would like to invite her to apply for this specific internship. Parker applied as soon as she got this message and after a few rounds of screenings and interviews, she was offered the position. For this specific internship, her team was looking for someone who had experience working as a cast member in a Disney Park and because of her time in the Disney College Program, as well as her attendance at the Tech Behind the Dreams event, she was able to apply to this internship.   ### Internships are learning experiences that build confidence  “This experience has helped me tremendously career-wise,” Parker says. “One major take-away for me is my networking skills. Disney makes a huge emphasis on networking within the company. I have met so many people and I have made notes on who they are and what they do. I have been able to reach out to people that I have met through work when I can’t find an answer to my question, or I need help with something I know they are an expert at. It is nice to know that everyone has each other’s backs, and everyone wants to stay connected.”  Something else that has helped Parker career-wise is she has learned to share all her ideas, big or small. “I have learned to speak up because that is how innovation happens. My supervisors have also been great about creating a supportive environment for me and constantly remind me to speak my mind and that I earned this position. Those constant reminders have helped me build confidence that I will take with me forever,” she says.  After graduating Parker is hoping to continue working with Walt Disney Imagineering. She would love to continue working with this same group working on immersive experiences, but would be happy anywhere within the company.  To anyone seeking an internship, her biggest pieces of advice would be to remember that first impressions are important and remember that internships are learning experiences. “Even if you don’t feel like your skills are perfect or feel like you don’t know some things, make it clear that you are excited and willing to learn, Parker says. “No one expects interns to know everything. Internships are a learning experience. Letting your personality shine through in interviews and sharing your passions and excitement will get you where you need to be.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## IUPUI Human-Computer Interaction Faculty and Students’ Work Published in Highly Regarded Journal  August 28, 2013  A paper authored by faculty and students in the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, examining our situation awareness and decision-making processes during emergencies, was recently published in a leading peer-reviewed journal, the Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making .      “Supporting Complex Decision Making Through Option Awareness” was written by Dr. Mark Pfaff, assistant professor of Media Arts and Science and Human-Computer Interaction, doctoral students Sung Pil Moon, Yikun Liu, and Steven Entezari, and Dr. Jill Drury and Dr. Gary Klein of the MITRE Corporation. It assesses two approaches to decision making in crisis conditions – option awareness, how we examine our available choices in complex and uncertain circumstances, and situation awareness, knowing and understanding what is going on in the surrounding environment.  The paper states that deeply understanding the range of outcomes resulting from one’s available options can lead to faster, more accurate, and more confident decisions during emergency events compared to focusing on situation awareness alone.  “We have just scratched the surface of option awareness,” said Pfaff. “Future studies with more complex and realistic tasks are forthcoming. We are now designing for expert decision makers in emergency medical services and state-level pandemic responses.”  The Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making is a publication dedicated to circulating scientifically grounded studies and articles examining real-world cognitive work and applying the findings toward new designs and procedures for complex work domains.

    "body": "  ## Virtual workplace panel explores how to succeed in an evolving work environment  April 20, 2021  The post-COVID workplace will never be the same. Understanding how to navigate an increasingly virtual employment landscape will be crucial as graduates from the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI seek jobs.  SoIC students can get practical insight through “The New Work Environment: How to Prepare for Remote Employment,” a free Zoom panel discussion from noon to 1 p.m., April 23, sponsored by the school’s BioHealth Informatics Research Center.  “Employers tell us they are seeking qualified students with the ‘soft skills’ needed to work in the business environment. This panel discussion is one of many programs the BioHealth Informatics Research Center is conducting to provide students with those skills,” says Gary Schwebach, professor of practice and BHIRC co-director.   ### Learning from industry leaders  The Zoom panel discussion will examine how students can prepare to excel in the new virtual workplace, as corporations shift increasingly to full-time remote employment enabled by information technology. This shift demands new skills, as we learn to work effectively with colleagues we may never meet face-to-face.  Speakers for this BHIRC virtual panel will include:  “Our students are used to working in person, but that has changed because of COVID-19,” Schwebach says. “We want to prepare our graduates to join the workforce with the skills they need for success in this new virtual world, both for their employers’ and their own sakes.”  This free presentation is open to all students at SoIC.

    "body": "  ## MLIS Guidelines   ### Planning your academic career  It is to your advantage to plan your academic career sooner rather than later in the program so as to assure that you:   ### Getting advice from your advisor  You should feel encouraged to contact your advisor to seek out their advice on selecting courses, working towards your degree, and preparing yourself for your post-MLIS career. To help your advisor answer your course selection questions, please fill out the advising checklist, along with courses you are interested in taking (see Mapping Your Academic Program). If you don’t know who your advisor is, login to the Advising Records (AdRx) application at One.IU . You may change your advisor once you determine or switch a specialization. Review the Course and Career Advising list above to identify options and email Angie Harmon.  [Advising Records (AdRx) application at One.IU](https://one.iu.edu/task/iu/advising-records)   ### Pre-requisites  Some courses have pre-requisites before allowing you to enroll in them. Review these by looking at the Library and Information Science courses page . For pre-requisites required for a course but not for a specialization, those credits will count towards a student’s electives.  Foundations note: S500 and S507 are foundation courses for every specialization effective Fall 2022 (and including students starting in Summer 2022). S500 and S507 can be taken sequentially or at the same time, but effective Fall 2022 they are the first two courses every LIS student must start with. If taking one course, S500 is the first one you must take.   ### Registering for courses  Review the Registrar’s registration page for details on dates you may sign-up for courses. This page will also provide information on how to use the one.iu.edu system to register your course selections.  [Registrar’s registration page](https://studentcentral.iupui.edu/register/)  Register as soon as possible. When you wait to the last minute, either a class may ‘fill’ with other students, or it may be cancelled due to an observed lack of interest.   ### Waitlists  If a class is full, be sure to place yourself on the waitlist. The department cannot plan on accommodating additional needs until and unless it sees that people are interested in a class.  When someone registered for a class drops it before the semester starts and you are on the waitlist, you will be notified. You must affirmatively register for the course at this time.  Faculty cannot add students to a course directly: they must come through the waitlist.   ### Transfer credits  You may transfer in a maximum of 6 credits from Luddy School of Informatics, Computing & Engineering programs. You may also transfer in a maximum of 6 credits from any program accredited by the American Library Association (ALA). No other transfers are allowed. Contact the director of the program for details, exceptions, and approvals.   ### Incompletes  Incompletes are not automatically granted. You may arrange a grade of “I” or incomplete for a course with an instructor for special circumstances. You and the instructor must agree upon the terms for completing the course.  Students who have multiple incompletes (2 or more) will be blocked from registering for additional LIS courses until there is only one (or zero) outstanding incomplete, or the student presents the department chair with a plan of action for completing all incompletes in a timely way.  Students need to have completed the majority of course work (75%+) at an acceptable level of achievement. Deadlines for the work for an incomplete to be finished are at the instructor’s discretion. The deadline can be no longer than 1 year from the end of the semester, but can be earlier if the instructor specifies that.   ### Time limit  All graduate courses that apply to the MLIS degree must be taken within a five-year time period, to ensure intellectual integrity and currency of content. This includes courses taken as a non-degree graduate student, prior to admission to the degree.  A one-year extension can be granted upon request with explanation of the unusual circumstances involved. No more than one year can be granted.  In rare circumstances, older courses can be “revalidated” if evidence is presented that the person has current knowledge of the topic. Please contact the chair for information about this.   ### Course load  It is unrealistic to expect to be a full time employee and a full time student.  The federal financial aid rule is that for graduate students, four to seven credits equals part time and eight or more credits equals full time. Practically that means two classes (six credits) for part time and three classes (nine credits) for full time. Only students who are working 10 hours a week or less, with limited family obligations, can expect to be successful with 12 credits.  Nine credits (three classes) is a full time commitment. It can be combined with a job that is 15-20 hours per week.  For those working 30-40 hours a week, many students are successful with two classes at a time.  The most common reason to drop a course is that the student realizes they are taking too many courses. This has significant financial consequences; IUPUI refund dates and federal financial aid requirements are strictly enforced.   ### Specializations  A specialization appears on your transcript, not your diploma. Current specializations (and dual degrees) are listed on the website, along with degree (course) checklists.  Advisors can approve course changes or waivers to fit your circumstances and course availability. The course number 604 is used for new course topics; these eventually are dropped or become regular courses. These new courses can be applied to specializations even when they are not listed on the degree checklists; have your advisor approve them. All changes should be confirmed via email and entered in your student records by your advisor.   ### Dual degrees  LIS has dual-degree agreements with Public History, Philanthropy, Health Informatics, and Law. These degrees are very specific, institutional, arrangements. You can only do these specific dual degrees; dual degrees offered by ILS-Bloomington are in partnership with Bloomington departments: there can be no cross-campus dual degrees, although, if you wish, you could pursue two degrees at the same time.  The benefit to you is a reduction in the total number of credits compared to taking each degree separately. The constraint is that you need to be admitted to both programs at the same time (or within the first semester of starting one program). You need to apply separately to each. You also need to finish both of them at the same time: even when you have finished all the credits for X degree, you cannot be awarded X until Y requirements are also met. Out of state students receive the LIS (Luddy School) scholarship for LIS credits only; the credits for the other program are billed to and controlled by the other program.   ### Independent Study  Students can take up to six hours of independent work or more if the advisor thinks it’s best for the student.  Independent study options include:   ### ePortfolio  There are two segments of LIS ePortfolio development, each with its own goals. Descriptions below serve as broad outlines for each ePortfolio’s design. Detailed step-by-step instructions, tutorials, sample exemplars, and rubrics are provided to students in the ePortfolio site .  [ePortfolio site](https://iu.instructure.com/courses/1802446)   ## Grades  LIS faculty follow the following definitions of achievement for graduate course grades.  Outstanding achievement. Student performance demonstrates full command of the course materials and evinces a high level of originality and/or creativity that far surpasses course expectations.  Excellent achievement. Student performance demonstrates thorough knowledge of the course materials and exceeds course expectations by completing all requirements in a superior manner.  Very good work. Student performance demonstrates above-average comprehension of the course materials and exceeds course expectations on all Modules as defined in the course syllabus.  Good work. Student performance meets designated course expectations, demonstrates understanding of the course materials, and performs at an acceptable level.  Marginal work. Student performance demonstrates incomplete understanding of course materials.  Unsatisfactory work. Student performance demonstrates incomplete and inadequate understanding of course materials. An incomplete may be granted under special circumstances.  Student has failed the course. An incomplete is not an available option.  Student has failed the course. An incomplete is not an available option. "

    "body": "  ## LIS-S 504 Cataloging  3 credits  [schedule](https://sisjee.iu.edu/sisigps-prd/web/igps/course/search/)   ### Description  This course will introduce the student to the practice of cataloging in any type of library. Students will learn how to create a bibliographic record and to edit and enhance existing records, primarily for print monographs. The course covers the basic functions of cataloging: resource descriptive, MARC tagging, subject analysis, authority work, and classification. Students begin by learning the International Cataloging Principles and LRM (Library Reference Model), which is what RDA is based on. RDA or Resource Description and Access is the international cataloging code that we follow to describe resources. Students will have extensive practice on recording and transcribing core RDA elements, and how they relate to LRM’s user tasks. Then students will learn how those elements are encoded into MARC. Once we have the basics of resource description covered, we add the art of subject analysis and creating access points. Finally, students will learn about classification through the two most common schemes, DDC (Dewey Decimal System) and LCC (Library of Congress Classification). There will be a brief introduction to BIBFRAME, which utilizes Linked Data structure in bibliographic statements. Throughout the course, the student will learn the importance of developing good cataloger’s judgement in bibliographic control.   ### Program Learning Goals Supported  Instructors map their courses to specific LIS Program Goals . Mapped program goals drive the design of each course and what students can expect to generally learn.  [LIS Program Goals](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/masters/mlis/program-goals.html)   ### Learning Outcomes  Instructors develop learning outcomes for their courses. Students can expect to be able to achieve the learning outcomes for a given course after successfully completing the course.   ### Course Overview  Instruction is in Canvas. Lessons are organized into Modules whose length may vary.

    "body": "  ## Student filmmaker wins accolades for documentary  September 26, 2016  Sam Mirpoorian, a senior in the Media Arts and Science (MAS) program at the IU School of Informatics at IUPUI, won the Best of Hoosier Lens award at the 2016 Indy Film Fest for the documentary film Under the Bridge: The Criminalization of Homelessness .  Mirpoorian and the film’s team recently signed a distribution deal with Indie Rights Films in Los Angeles.  Known by his friends and associates as Sam Miro, Mirpoorian produced the documentary film , which focuses on a homeless camp that has existed for more than 20 years in downtown Indianapolis—located under a bridge at the intersection of South Davidson and East Maryland streets.  [the documentary film](http://www.thefilmyap.com/movies/under-the-bridge-the-criminalization-of-homelessness/)  Watch the trailer for Under the Bridge :    Under the Bridge was initially produced in 2014 as Uncharted: The Truth Behind Homelessness . Its first screening was held at the IUPUI Campus Center. Viewings around Indianapolis—including University of Indianapolis and the Indianapolis Museum of Art—brought the film to the attention of homeless advocates who were inspired to start working on a Bill of Rights. After an initial draft was vetoed, a later version of the bill was passed, making Indianapolis the first city in the nation to have such legislation.  Unsuccessful attempts to attract distributors for the film led Mirpoorian and his partners back to the editing room to create a more balanced piece. Under the Bridge was finished in winter 2015. The documentary received national attention by the U.S. Dept. of Justice, the U.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development, and Harvard University. In addition, the film exposed Mirpoorian to experts working in the industry, several of whom had key roles in revising the film.  “The MAS program taught me how to realistically manage multiple projects and maintain a balance,” Mirpoorian said. Guidance from staff like academic advisor Melinda McCormick helped him to map his academic path. And the school’s Career Services Office helped him find options for reaching his goals.  Mirpoorian first used his camera for an assignment as a sophomore in high school, and shortly after that began to acquire better equipment—producing music videos that earned him a following on social media.  Feeling that filmmaking was a legitimate pursuit, he chose the MAS program as an ideal environment for exploring his creativity. The idea for the film came from his filmmaking partner Adam Oppenheim, a writer who was looking for help with creating a film about the homeless situation.  After graduation, Mirpoorian intends to pursue filmmaking opportunities in other U.S. markets. Those films will likely involve his interests in the environment and social issues.  He has no regrets about attending the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI. His advice to other students? Be realistically optimistic. “Whatever you want to do is possible,” he says. “Understand that there are barriers, but there is a way. Prepare to make sacrifices, but don’t be discouraged.”  Learn more about and view Mirpoorian’s work.

They examine the roles of literacy, technology, heritage, preservation, education, and engagement in community access to information.   ### Aging in Place  Aqueasha Martin-Hammond explores the use of computers as tools that can change and motivate human behavior, and how technology can support aging in place and assist with the challenges and barriers that limit older adults’ engagement with computing devices. She is examining health and accessibility challenges, and ways to design and develop technology that can help, such as personalizing interfaces to support older adults’ engagement with technology and to motivate active participation in their health.   ### Cultural Heritage  Andrea Copeland is co-editor of Participatory Heritage, which explores research that looks at new challenges for cultural heritage institutions that are brought about by social media. She was also lead organizer for The Human Library at IUPUI, a campus-funded Welcoming Campus Initiative designed to provide a safe place for conversations around difficult subjects and among diverse people. Copeland, together with Ayoung Yoon, Zebulun Wood, and Albert William, led the Virtual Bethel project that digitally preserved the Bethel AME Church, an historic African-American landmark in Indianapolis.   ### Wage Focus  A $494K NSF grant is enabling worker-centered design of workplace information systems and applications— improving transparency, collaboration, and the accuracy of compensation in traditionally low-wage industries. Researchers Lynn Dombrowski and Davide Bolchini are addressing how the design of workers’ time reporting systems and other technologies can decrease longstanding problems surrounding wage discrepancies and compensation labor laws in low-wage occupations.

    "body": "  ## Health Informatics director’s study of emergency care honored with 2011 Distinguished Paper award  January 13, 2012  The first study to examine patterns of emergency care for an entire state has found that 40 percent of emergency department visits in Indiana over a three-year period were by patients who visited more than one emergency department. This finding challenges conventional wisdom that patients are tightly bound to health care systems and tend to repeatedly visit local facilities.  The Regenstrief Institute study, “All Health Care Is Not Local: An Evaluation of the Distribution of Emergency Department Care Delivered in Indiana” has been honored with a 2011 Distinguished Paper award at the AMIA Annual Symposium. AMIA is a professional society of health care professionals, informatics researchers and thought leaders in biomedicine, health care and science.  The Regenstrief study reports that nearly all emergency departments in Indiana shared patients with nearly every other emergency department. The high degree of connectedness between emergency departments had not been previously recognized at this scale, according to researchers.  The study illustrates that emergency departments need instant access to information from wide swaths of geographic areas to better treat patients.  As patients in the emergency department often forget key details, or are too ill or injured to provide relevant medical history, medications or allergy information, immediate access to their complete medical records is critical to providing appropriate care.  “What may appear to be a simple problem is no longer simple when someone comes in for a second or third ED visit for the same issue,” said John T. Finnell, M.D., M.S., an author of the study who serves as director and associate professor of Health Informatics and is also an emergency medicine physician. “You are no longer thinking earache, you are thinking possible bone infection. Knowing that patient who comes to the ED with chest pain had a recent clear cardiac scan will make a difference in treatment.”  Finnell is also an associate professor of emergency medicine at the IU School of Medicine and research scientist for the Regenstrief Institute.  The researchers were not surprised by the large volume of visits to emergency departments across the state. About 2.8 million patients generated 7.4 million visits over three years. But the wide range of the number of visits per patient – from one to 385 – was unexpected.  “Although the findings were specific to Indiana, ED use in other states is likely to be quite similar because there is nothing particularly unique about emergency care delivery in Indiana,” Finnell said.

    "body": "  ## 2021 Wilma Moore scholars continue an information legacy  January 27, 2022  Lauren Harris (left) and Raneem Hijazi, the 2021 recipients of the Wilma Moore Scholarship, exemplify the versatility of an MLIS degree. The scholarship celebrates and encourages increasing diversity in library science.  From cultural preservation to electronic records management, the recipients have discovered how earning a master’s degree in library and information science from the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI will help them to achieve their goals.   ### Career focused  “I knew I needed additional training to be less reactive and be proactive when it came to records management or various policy changes I encounter,” says Harris, who works at Medxcel, a provider of health care facilities services.  “I am a regulatory compliance coordinator, and assist with confirming the correct licensing and keeping track of licensing and other government documents.  “I was attending a webinar about electronic records management and one of the presenters had an MLIS. I researched and found that it really aligned with what I do currently and where I want to take my career next.”  Harris is focused on digital preservation, especially data governance, and records management.  “Most people think of medical librarians in a hospital,” she notes. “But other aspects of health care would benefit from an information professional on their staff.”   ### Documenting a culture  “As I grew up, I have always been connected to my Palestinian heritage,” says Hijazi. “I want to help Palestinians around the world fight forced erasure of their identity by digitally preserving elements of Palestinian culture as a digital archivist and curator.”  As she researched how to best accomplish her goal, she discovered SoIC and its master’s of library and information science degree.  “I was intrigued by the possible career paths,” Hijazi says. “I don’t think I could have ever pursued this career path without learning all there was to library sciences, which I’m excited to continue doing throughout my graduate degree.  “My dream is to travel to Palestine and document the stories of the Palestinians and help spread and preserve these stories throughout the world to show the truth of the occupation as they live it.”   ### Continuing Moore’s legacy  Andrea Copeland, Ph.D., is chair and program director of the Department of Library and Information Science at SoIC.  “ Ms. Moore was a great mentor to many librarians and archivists in our community and I know she would have loved working with both Lauren and Raneem,” she says.  “It’s such a gift to the profession that her legacy will continue to influence generations of librarians to come.  “Being able to support students in the work that Wilma started and to honor her in the process is deeply meaningful to those of us who had the privilege of knowing and working with her,” says Copeland, an associate professor with the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI.   ### About Wilma Gibbs Moore  The Wilma Gibbs Moore Graduate Endowed Scholarship memorializes Moore and her many contributions to the historical record of African Americans in Indiana.  Wilma Gibbs Moore graduated from Crispus Attucks High School and received her B.S. in sociology and her master’s in library science degree from Indiana University.  She worked at Indiana University Libraries and the Indianapolis Public Library.  Moore retired from the Indiana Historical Society after 30 years.   ### Continuing a legacy of giving back  Harris and Hijazi are carrying on a proud tradition.  “For all that Ms. Wilma Gibbs Moore did for the Indianapolis community and Black librarians in Indiana,”  Harris says, “it’s humbling and empowering to be walking on the path she paved for me and the other scholarship recipients as an aspiring information professional.”  And, Hijazi notes, “Ms. Moore has already done work in the way that I hope to do one day.  “Having her as a role model to look up to throughout my graduate career is so inspiring. It’s an honor to be awarded a scholarship named after such an influential person in the preservation of African-American culture.”   ### How to support this scholarship  Visit our alumni and partners page and click on the Give Now button.

    "body": "  ## Virtual reality game built by IUPUI students challenges players to escape from Breakout High  November 15, 2019  (Contributed by Rich Schneider, originally published May 8, 2019)    Gamers in Indianapolis have a new virtual world to play in, one built by a team of IUPUI media arts and science students where players must use their puzzle-solving wits to escape the clutches of a villain who has locked them inside a school.  The game, “ Breakout High ,” is available for play at BlueWall VR, a virtual reality arcade at 5967 E. 82nd St. in Castleton.  [Breakout High](https://youtu.be/bsDHFPJb-1M)  After donning a VR headset, players find they have been locked inside a classroom in Breakout High by the villainous Mr. Jack. Players escape from a series of locked rooms, and eventually the school, by solving puzzles.  The students developed the game as part of a team-driven project-based learning course, N420 Multimedia Project Development . The student team was paired with BlueWall VR as a client, said Joshua Kottka, who led the student team as product manager.  [N420 Multimedia Project Development](https://luddy.iupui.edu/courses/newm-n420/)  “They wanted a VR game, so we met with them for a couple of weeks to brainstorm ideas about what type of game we should develop,” Kottka said. “We eventually narrowed it down to a puzzle-solving game, like an escape room.”  “I think we were all pretty excited to work on a virtual reality game,” Kottka said. “Virtual reality and augmented reality games are still not quite as popular as other types of video game genres, but they are new and emerging. The really interesting thing about virtual reality is that it is still super-new.”  Jonathan Renninger, who served as lead programmer, said learning the ins and outs of virtual reality programming was the most interesting part of the project. “I had to do a lot of research and learn how to program that kind of stuff,” he said.  That included designing puzzles that lead a player from one step to the next, such as a bookcase on which books have to be placed in a certain order, Renninger said.  “Breakout High” may be the first game Kottka and Renninger developed for a client, but it won’t be their last.  After he graduates from IUPUI May 11, Kottka said, he will be applying for internships at gaming studios around the country: “That’s really my goal after graduation, making more games and stuff.”  He believes his work on “Breakout High” will give him a leg up on that quest. “This will definitely help. For a year, I was project manager for ‘Breakout High.’ So I have that to put on my resume.”  Renninger, who is also graduating, hopes his experience developing “Breakout High” will burnish his portfolio. “It also helped me learn a bit more about how to work with a client. So I hope further on down the line this will help me deal with clients and with programming for other games in the future.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

Recital, performance, exhibition portfolio, or other project; written or electronically recorded documentation. Demonstrates critical and/or creative thinking.  Thesis: If your goal is to earn a Ph.D. and enter academia, completing a master’s thesis is likely to better prepare you for doctoral research and dissertation, in terms of research design; qualitative and or quantitative methods; and understanding the related academic literature in your field.  Project: If you plan to go into industry, you may be better served by doing a master’s project in collaboration with an industry partner. If an industry partner is not available, choosing a project in your area of career interest is advised. You’ll be able to apply your project work directly in practice, and it will improve your skills in achieving outcomes that will prove valuable to your career.   ### What to expect  By the end of the first year, the student will select a master’s project/thesis committee chair who is a member of the graduate faculty, has an appointment in our school and is authorized to chair a master’s project/thesis. This individual will assume responsibility for advising the student about course selection, graduation requirements, and master’s project procedures.  You will be responsible for understanding how to perform all required components of your project/ thesis, which may require you to independently pursue additional learnings outside of the standard course materials. You will need to keep your Committee chair informed of any specific areas requiring additional learnings.  If a master’s project or thesis is related in any way to your professional work, you must describe for your advisor how that topic and your job are distinct. You must be able to explain how the work you’re doing as a part of your master’s project or thesis goes above and beyond what you ordinarily do for your job.   ### General Guidelines  Need help coming up with ideas? Plan to attend the project workshop held weekly by the HI program.  Many informatics projects will be exempt from full IRB review. However, the IRB must grant the exemption. Research with human subjects that is not approved by the IRB constitutes scientific misconduct and is subject to disciplinary action. The student is responsible for obtaining IRB approval. This process should be started as soon as possible during the first step of master’s work. Direction on how to get approval or exemption by IRB can be found at Kuali Coeus (KC) on OneStart. "

    "body": "  ## LIS-S 672 Seminar on Literature for Youth  3 credits  [schedule](https://sisjee.iu.edu/sisigps-prd/web/igps/course/search/)   ### Description  These advanced topical seminars address a variety of topics related to youth literature. View individual course descriptions below for specific course focus. Students may take S672 twice during their program as long as they take two different seminar topics.   ### Informational Reading and Nonfiction Works  Informational reading and nonfiction works play a key role in both national recommendations and state standards. This emphasis is generating new demands for both school and public libraries as well as opportunities for collection development and collaboration. This course will explore a wide range of informational texts. In addition, it will examine issues related to selecting quality, complex texts, addressing the needs of reluctant readers, and engaging young people in stimulating reading experiences. From graphic biographies and histories to plant and animal field guides, libraries are full of engaging nonfiction for children and young adults. By pairing popular fiction with nonfiction books, identifying clusters of related works, introducing graphic novel-style nonfiction to reluctant readers, and tying engaging nonfiction works to online tools and eBook resources, librarians can attract new readers and promote essential 21st century skills. In addition, this course explores ways that readers’ advisory services can be used to connect nonfiction titles with readers through both direct and indirect means. Finally, nonfiction reading is fun! This course provides opportunities to read and analyze a wide range of nonfiction books for youth.   ### Read Like a Writer  (offered in even-numbered years)  This three-credit graduate course examines children’s and youth literature from the point of view of the reader. We will be exploring high quality literature in an effort to broaden each other’s knowledge and experience with the hundreds of titles that rise to the top each year. Reading will be measured in terms of volume (see formula below). Additionally, this course is designed as a “seminar.” A seminar focuses on a particular subject of interest and participants are encouraged to learn through exploration, individual goal setting, sharing and discussion. As such, dialogue, discussion, and debate will play a central role in the seminar. While background information is provided for each topic and concept to get you started, it’s your job to jump into the professional literature along with the youth literature to come up with your own conclusions about the state of literature for youth . This truly is a class where your approach directly impacts your outcome.  Enduring Understandings for S672 “Read Like a Writer”:  Essential Questions for S672 “Read Like a Writer”:   ### Representation in YA Literature  In this class we will take a critical multicultural literacy stance. This asks the reader to deconstruct how meaning, language, craft, and reading are used to exhibit the power dynamics of race, class and gender. Readers, like writers, exist within a sociopolitical context that is brought into the act of reading. Questions to consider when engaging in acts of literacy for young adults through a critical lens include:  How is this text trying to make me feel?  Who is represented and how?  Who holds power and who does not?  Whose voices are included? Whose voices are left out?  Why do you think the author or illustrator makes those choices? What biases do I bring to the text? Students will meet with authors and explore marginalized voices that craft and innovate young adult literature. Students will explore the histories and politics of reading when they critically evaluate YA literature, engage in ways to promote literacy, reader response and readers’ advisory.   ### What’s Trending in Youth Literature (offered in odd-numbered years)  This three-credit graduate course examines current trends in children’s and youth literature publishing as they relate to libraries and their patrons. We will be exploring high quality literature in an effort to broaden each other’s knowledge and experience with the hundreds of titles that rise to the top each year. Reading will be measured in terms of volume (see formula below).

This course introduces principles supporting the development and implementation of metadata schemes, focusing on issues of interoperability, internal and external standardization, and evaluation. Proper understanding and development of metadata is the responsibility of any librarian or information professional. Cataloging with the MARC standard has been a major task for decades, and you must begin any discussion of metadata with a look at this old but venerable standard. You then move on, however, to an exploration of metadata designed for digital collections. The study of Dublin Core will introduce you to the main concepts of object description and also allow you to acquire some skills in MODS and VRA standards as you also explore METS and PREMIS. You will use a full-featured digital-asset management system (CONTENTdm) to perform some hands-on exercises and development. The course will also cover concepts of bad and/or biased metadata.   ### Program Learning Goals Supported  Instructors map their courses to specific LIS Program Goals . Mapped program goals drive the design of each course and what students can expect to generally learn.  [LIS Program Goals](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/masters/mlis/program-goals.html)   ### Learning Outcomes  Instructors develop learning outcomes for their courses. Students can expect to be able to achieve the learning outcomes for a given course after successfully completing the course.   ### Course Overview  Instruction is in Canvas.

    "body": "  ## Faculty receive grant to explore how tech may help older adults with health care  November 5, 2021   ##### Managing your health care can be complex and time-consuming, especially as you get older. Wouldn’t it be nice if you had an assistant to keep track of appointments, medications, and more?  Faculty member Aqueasha Martin-Hammond , Ph.D., has received a $498,904 National Science Foundation grant to explore how intelligent assistants, such as Siri and Alexa, can help older adults with daily health-care information tasks at home. She serves as principal investigator for the project, “Designing Autonomy Preserving Interactions in Intelligent Assistants for Older Adults. ”  [Martin-Hammond](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/aqueasha-martin-hammond/)  [“Designing Autonomy Preserving Interactions in Intelligent Assistants for Older Adults.](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2130583&HistoricalAwards=false)  “Managing different types of information related to care can be challenging and overwhelming, especially if that process involves multiple doctors, multiple people, or even just a busy schedule,” says Martin-Hammond, assistant professor of human-computer interaction at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI. “Daily, one might have to handle appointment information, information from a doctor, or information about medications, or even just a busy schedule.”  [School of Informatics and Computing](https://luddy.iupui.edu)   ### Agency and accessibility  The NSF-funded research builds on work she and her team have been doing with intelligent assistants (IAs).  “We found one concern with these types of technologies was the lack of agency, or sense of control, that people feel they have over their data and interactions,” says Martin-Hammond.  “For example, they might find it challenging to understand the data returned by the IA, or who has access to their health data.  “In our past studies, older adults also have expressed that while they believe IAs could make accessing online health information easier and more accessible, they have concerns about how intrusive the current systems are.”  Accessibility for older adults is a particular concern, notes Davide Bolchini , Ph.D. and chair of SoIC’s Department of Human-Centered Computing , who is co-principal investigator for the project.  [Bolchini](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/davide-bolchini/)  [Department of Human-Centered Computing](https://luddy.iupui.edu/hcc/)  “Conversational user interfaces (CUI’s) are becoming an important part of the digital ecosystem available to users,” he says, “yet these platforms are still understudied from the unique perspective of older adults, especially when accessing current and future services related to health support and social well-being.”   ### Working with local seniors and caregivers  The highly competitive NSF-funded project is a timely example of novel research at the intersection of human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, and accessibility, with potential for broader community impact.  The project also has an Indiana connection.  “In this project, we will be continuing our partnerships with senior organizations in the local community to engage older adults and their informal caregivers,” Martin-Hammond says, to further understand the challenges of interacting with intelligent assistants for health information-related care tasks.  The researchers hope to advance their understanding of how to design IAs that allow seniors to preserve a sense of autonomy and independence, while helping to carry out health information tasks at home.  “In partnership with older adults and their caregivers, we will use what we learn to design strategies and build systems that can help overcome feelings about the lack of control in the interactions,” Martin-Hammond explains, “and provide more transparency when engaging with intelligent assistants for care tasks.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

[Informatics Diversity Enhanced Workforce (iDEW)](https://luddy.iupui.edu/idew/)  Launched in 2015, iDEW, an initiative created and administered by the Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, aims to address the critical shortage of skilled underrepresented  women and minorities in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) fields. The year-round program kicked off at Arsenal Technical, Providence Cristo Rey, and Pike high schools in Indianapolis, introducing information technology (IT) career opportunities through innovative learning education modules.  The $100,000 AT&T contribution will support the purchase of 30 computers and travel costs for field trips during summer iDEW workshops over the next 4 years. It will allow students to learn applications of technology and witness IT careers in action while they visit places and share experiences otherwise not possible for them. A total of 360 students will be served by the funding during this 4-year period.  AT&T Indiana President Bill Soards shared the good news with iDEW Program Director and School of Informatics and Computing Executive Associate Dean Mathew J. Palakal, Pike High School Principal Troy Inman, President and CEO of Providence Cristo Rey Joe Heidt, Director of Career and Technical Education at Indianapolis Public Schools Ben Carter, teachers and students in the iDEW program, and representatives of Indianapolis local government.  “Our iDEW initiative addresses local and national IT and informatics workforce needs through community partnerships, and by attracting diverse high school students to informatics subjects with interesting, innovative, and engaging programs,” said Mathew J. Palakal. “We are so thrilled to have this AT&T Aspire support for our efforts at growing a successful and diverse workforce that can power the digital economy.”  “The iDEW program through the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI has made a great impact on our computer science program here at Pike High School. Pike and IUPUI faculty have teamed up together to write and teach a new curriculum that helps our students to be college-ready and employable. This has been a great benefit to our students, who also receive college credit,” said Troy Inman. “The iDEW program has been a tremendous asset to us and has helped to increase our enrollment in the computer science courses.”  “Honestly, I was never really interested in anything that has to do with computers. However, after the first semester of being in Introduction to Computer Science, I realized that I genuinely enjoyed the class and the things that were being taught,” said Katya Dominguez, an iDEW student at Pike High School. “Being in the iDEW program has helped me recognize my interest in the field of technology and let me witness all the different opportunities that are offered to people like me.”  AT&T Aspire drives innovation in education through technology, social innovation, and relationships to ensure all students have the skills they need to succeed in school and beyond.     ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Data science is pervasive  The Ph.D. minor in Applied Data Science offers doctoral students in other disciplines the opportunity to learn data science approaches and apply them to problems in their major. Data science is now applied to every field. Data science concepts and approaches are required of researchers who collect, curate, manage, analyze, and visualize the big data found in massive, complex, diverse, and distributed repositories.  Our nation’s research enterprise is positioned for gains from the accelerated growth in the generation of digitally born data, and advances in security, privacy, and ethics will be paramount to realizing these gains. The gains are furthered by the potential to link scholarly publications with the data on which the research is based and uniquely identify each dataset for discovery through a web of linked data. The economic potential of research can be realized more fully and quickly when the research can be replicated, and when data can be shared broadly and used and reused in science and policymaking.   ## Minor Requirements  The Ph.D. minor in Applied Data Science is a 12-credit hour program comprised of four (4) courses, each of which is 3 credit hours.   ### Prerequisites (6 cr.)

    "body": "  ## Usability expert Aaron Marcus comes to IUPUI  October 25, 2010  Internationally-renowned usability consultant and expert Aaron Marcus comes to Indianapolis on November 11th to mark the 2010 World Usability Day.  Marcus, president of Berkeley, California-based consulting firm Aaron Marcus and Associates, will address local businesses and researchers on integrating usability and interaction design principles in technology, products and services. Usability focuses on improving user experience through the design of accessible technologies and interfaces that not only solve problems, but are intuitive, functional and enjoyable to use.  Marcus is a leading pioneer in the usability and design fields, becoming the world’s first designer to be involved full-time in computer graphics in 1967. He has since gone on to receive numerous distinguished honors for his work, author six books and write more than 250 publications. His firm was instrumental in designing the user interfaces of what would become the first versions of AOL and Travelocity.  Scheduled for the IUPUI Campus Center, the 2010 World Usability Day event is presented by the Indiana Chapter of the Usability Professionals Association and the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI.  “Indiana is very privileged to welcome Aaron Marcus,” said Stephen Hatfield, vice president and conferences director of the Indiana Chapter of the UPA. “He is a pioneer in all facets of communication, technology and usability. This is an opportunity for Indiana professionals hear and learn from one of the best.”  To register for the 2010 World Usability Day, please visit www.indiana-upa.org or e-mail indianaupa@gmail.com. Registration is $50, including lunch. Students may register for $30. The event will take place on the third floor of the IUPUI Campus Center.  Hear Aaron Marcus discuss the 2010 World Usability Day in Indianapolis here (link will prompt an audio file to be downloaded and opened).  World Usability Day was founded in 2005 by the worldwide Usability Professionals’ Association in recognition that much of today’s technology is often prohibitively complex for the average user. Each year, on the second Thursday of November, more than 200 events in 43 countries are organized to raise awareness of usability among the general public, and to train professionals in the tools and issues central to good usability research, development and practice.  About Aaron Marcus Aaron Marcus is the founder and President of Aaron Marcus and Associates, Inc. (AM+A). A graduate in physics from Princeton University and in graphic design from Yale University, in 1967 he became the world’s first graphic designer to be involved fulltime in computer graphics. Marcus is also a Fellow of AIGA, a member of CHI Academy, an ICOGRADA Master Graphic Designer of the Twentieth Century, and a SIGGRAPH Pioneer of computer graphics. He has written/co-written six books and more than 250 publications. He is the Editor-in-Chief Emeritus of UPA’s User Experience Magazine.  Marcus focuses his attention on the Web and wireless communication, mobile devices, helping the industry to learn about good user-centered, user-interface and information-visualization design, providing guidelines for globalization/localization, the challenges of “baby faces” (small displays for consumer information appliances) of ubiquitous devices, and cross-cultural communication.  Marcus is currently the architect of two concepts gaining worldwide attention. The first, My Green Machine, is a mobile phone concept design that seeks to change people’s behavior about saving energy. Four case studies have been published in the US, Europe, Africa, and South Korea. Learn more on YouTube.  A second, called Customized Currency, is a concept by which the US Treasury might earn $700 billion and thereby reduce the US FY 2010 deficit by half and/or reduce the US debt significantly.

    "body": "  ## Advancing the Game: School of Informatics and Computing gets its game on for Gen Con 2012  August 13, 2012  Every summer since 2003, thousands of gamers descend upon downtown Indianapolis for a four-day gaming marathon . Gen Con — one of the largest conventions held in Indianapolis, with more than 37,000 attendees in 2011 — is the largest gaming convention in North America. This year, Gen Con is August 16 to 19. And this year, Gen Con has an even closer tie to IUPUI than it did in 2009: an educational partnership with the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, the first of its kind for either the school or the convention.    Mathew Powers, a lecturer in the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, explains: “GenCon is committed to the advancement of play and gaming, and the Media Arts and Science program at Informatics takes the creation and production of gaming very seriously, with an entire program track devoted to game creation . So we felt it was a natural partnership. While the partnership is new and some of the finer points have yet to be worked out, we are proud to be the first university that Gen Con has partnered with.”  Both Gen Con and Informatics embrace all forms of gaming, from role-playing to board to collectible card to video games.  Over the years, the Media Arts and Science program in the School of Informatics and Computing has focused on website design, film/video, sound, animation 3D creation, stereoscopic creation, and, of course, gaming. This last category has grown rapidly over the past six years as gaming has become mainstream and accessible to more and more people. Educational and commercial enterprises have seen the potential and effectiveness that gaming has on its students and employees. Gaming has been shown to help retain knowledge and assist in critical thinking. All these aspects have drawn more and more students to this developing profession with solid results.  One such example is Justin DeCloedt, a graduate of the MAS program who studied sound creation and design. After graduation he was hired as a sound designer at the world-renowned game company Blizzard, which produces World of Warcraft. While gaming is fun, it is also a solid ticket to a real-world job, giving students the ability to take their own creations and affect millions of players worldwide.  The MARLA (Media Arts and Science Research Lab and Arcade) Lab  MAS’s new program director, Dr. Joseph Defazio, is committed to helping the gaming program and its gaming students with several new ideas and directions. One such direction is being pioneered by Powers and fellow Informatics faculty member Todd Shelton with the creation of MARLA-2. An addition to the original dedicated game lab, MARLA — the Media Arts and Science Research Lab and Arcade — MARLA-2 will explore the burgeoning world of mobile gaming. Students will be able to compete with their creations in the real-world market in a space dedicated to the creation of games existing on all manners of mobile devices. New classes devoted to game programming and creation led by Travis Faas are currently being developed as well.  In future years, the partnership will include more events and activities at Gen Con itself, but this initial year is starting off relatively small. An event Friday afternoon will include a tour of the convention by Jake Theis, senior marketing director of Gen Con LLC. After the tour is a panel of gaming giants: Peter Adkison, former CEO and founder of Wizards of the Coast and current Gen Con LLC board member, and Larry Roznai, Mayfair Games CEO, will be presenting and answering questions for invited members of the Informatics and IUPUI community.   ### Gaming Groups at IUPUI  The School of Informatics and Computing sponsors several gaming clubs, focusing on a variety of the elements that make up the gaming world. These groups give students a chance to play to their strengths and produce works that could not be done in a classroom. All groups meet throughout the year on Fridays in the IT building. Those interested in joining any of the groups below should contact Mathew Powers at matapowe@indiana.edu.   #### Gamers’ Guild  Founded more than eight years ago, the Gamers’ Guild is the longest-running student group in Informatics’ history. It draws 30-50 gamers every Friday during the school year when it meets in IT167 from noon until midnight. The group has well over 150 members and meets during summer as well. The guild’s motto — “If you bring it, we will play it!” — draws gamers who play everything from board to card to video games. The group has sponsored a tournament for the entire school almost every semester and even held a tournament to support Riley Hospital for Children at IU Health. Additionally, they have absorbed the campus Magic the Gathering club as well as the LARPing society, which puts on annual workshops to help new students make their own weapons.  The Gamers’ Guild is run by President Jon Rick and Vice President Cassie Hopper. They have both strived to increase the reach of the guild while at the same time improving its internal workings for all members. Brendon Steele operates the Magic the Gathering group, while Will “Zigler” Robertson manages the LARPing sides of the group.   #### 3DGDG: (3D Game Developers Group)  This student group was founded by Stacia Lowery to help gather all those students who wish to work on original projects outside class and to better their game-making and 3D skills. It is the school’s youngest group but has been meeting regularly on Friday nights in the IT computer lab from 6 to 9 p.m., even during the summer. The group has over 100 members and has put on workshops to help students in the realms of 3D modeling, game programming, texturing, creature creation, etc. The students are developing three original games and a bevy of assets for future students to use in their games. They have even had guest speakers share their ideas on gaming, like Zeb Wood from the Art Institutes and Jason Guy who worked on Sid Meier’s Civilization and the popular game Railroad Tycoon. They are all about helping fellow students reach their potential and are a shining example of where hard work can get you in the gaming field  Additionally, officers Kathryn Thacker, Dustin Ostrum, Kevin Trehan, Terry Gast and Cody Hansel strive to bring new content and challenges to their respective teams every week.   #### Anime Club  The Anime Club is a recent addition to the Informatics student group lineup. This group is all anime all the time and promotes all aspects of this artistic genre. The members regularly meet in the IT building from noon to midnight. Here they watch anime movies and TV shows, as well as discuss manga and various sub-categories of this genre. Their numbers have been steadily growing, and they are active at Anime Crossroads and GenCon. They are going to be holding many more events in 2012 and in partnership with the other student groups.  The Anime Club is guided by Courtney Pollard, Montez Harris and Ruendy Carrillo Gámez, all of whom regularly attend anime conventions to promote their group and their love of the art.   #### Cosplay Club  The Cosplay Club is a crazy hot-bed of creativity. This groups seeks to help fellow students craft and create costumes for fun and for conventions. It was started by Brat Conway, a serious Cosplay enthusiast and the winner of the Overall Cosplay Contest at GenCon in 2010. The club meets every Friday in the IT building; members bring all kinds of cloth, plastic, foam and other materials, along with their sewing machines, to help create original works. Everyone is welcome, and they are hard at work finishing their costumes for this year’s GenCon.  The Cosplay Club core council of Meredith Caudle, Stephanie Hii and Sam Hii meet every week with Conway to construct costumes with their own supplies. All are willing to tutor and train walk-ins on the finer parts of Cosplay.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Unique program bringing electronic medical record data to ambulances lauded  July 10, 2012  The nation’s first and only program linking paramedics in the field to patients’ pre-existing health information — enabling emergency workers to make more informed treatment decisions and to transport patients to the most appropriate facility — has been recognized by the prestigious Computerworld Honors Program.  The Indianapolis Emergency Medical Services Electronic Patient Care Reporting / Indiana Network for Patient Care program, a collaboration of Indianapolis EMS , the INPC , the Regenstrief Institute , the Indiana Health Information Exchange (IHIE), and Medusa Medical Technologies was honored at a Washington, D.C., ceremony recently for providing emergency medical technicians in the field with the ability to securely access a patient’s health data, enhancing the quality, safety and efficiency of the care they deliver.  [Indianapolis EMS](http://indianapolisems.org/)  [INPC](http://www.regenstrief.org/medinformatics/inpc)  [Regenstrief Institute](http://www.regenstrief.org)  [Indiana Health Information Exchange](http://www.ihie.org)  [Medusa Medical Technologies](http://www.medusamedical.com/)  Metropolitan Indianapolis is the most health wired area in the United States. Indianapolis EMS ambulances now carry tablet computers to gain secure access to patient data abstracts compiled from visits to hospital systems, along with laboratory test results and prescription information, throughout central Indiana.  For example, paramedics are able to view a heart attack victim’s previous EKG and compare it to an emergency EKG administered in the field. This allows emergency services providers to make decisions based on changes in test results, potentially reducing heart muscle damage and increasing survival rates.  “Electronic medical record technology has been widely recognized for its role in improving quality of care, increasing efficiency of health care delivery, preventing medical errors and enhancing patient safety,” said John T. Finnell, M.D., director of health informatics at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, associate professor of emergency medicine at the Indiana University School of Medicine, and Regenstrief Institute investigator, who developed the link between electronic medical records and emergency treatment in the field. “Using Regenstrief research and technology, Indianapolis is the only place in the country that is able to securely push health care data to medics in real time, which can impact the pre-hospital care provided.”  Research leading to extension of electronic medical records to the ambulance was supported by grants from the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services and Homeland Security.  “We took an existing product out of the hospital emergency department, modified the software and extended its use to wherever the Indianapolis EMS responders travel to help those with medical emergencies,” Dr. Finnell said. “The Regenstrief Institute provided the technical expertise to allow interface between tablet PCs and an abstract of the patient’s medical record. The INPC compiles the data that is transmitted by IHIE. Add in the IU School of Medicine and MESH, which have also contributed, and this project is a true collaboration.”  “In a perfect world, every health care practitioner caring for you would have access to your critical health care information wherever and whenever it’s needed,” said William Tierney, M.D., president and CEO of the Regenstrief Institute, Chancellor’s Professor and associate dean for clinical effectiveness research at the IU School of Medicine, and chief of internal medicine for Wishard Hospital, whose EMS service first installed and used this EMS information system. “Unfortunately, each hospital, medical lab, X-ray facility, pharmacy and doctor’s office uses a different medical record system that cannot be accessed when needed. With hospitals, labs, X-ray facilities and pharmacies securely providing critical patient data to the Indiana Network for Patient Care, EMS technicians, in this case, can more quickly and accurately figure out what your problem is and how best to treat it.”  Computerworld Honors is the longest-running global program to honor individuals and organizations that use information technology to promote positive social, economic and educational change.

    "body": "  ## Media Arts and Science faculty member explores storytelling in e-book  December 8, 2014  Telling stories has been an integral part of culture, history and the human experience. That’s not changing any time soon, even if technology affects the way stories reach audiences, said an Indiana University faculty member who explored storytelling in a recently published e-book, “Once Upon a Digital Story, A Modern Approach to an Ancient Art.”  Susan Tennant, a clinical associate professor in human centered computing in the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, believes storytelling will remain an important part of the human experience even in the digital age, because it is the foundation of everything. “You can make an animation, a game or website, but what is it about? Without a story as the foundation, you’re just making stuff with no substance.”  Tennant’s e-book explores the role of storytelling through time from traditional to digital. The book covers the concepts, principles and construction of storytelling across a variety of digital formats and platforms.  Her e-book was also printed, but it was meant to be an e-book because it contains hyperlinks that immediately lead the reader to additional material, something that can’t be accomplished with the printed page.  Asked by the publisher, Cognella.com, to write the book, Tennant said she decided to seize that opportunity because it offered a chance to put her “thumbprint” on the page on the subject of storytelling.  Technology will continue to have impact, Tennant said. “The way we read stories will probably be more condensed on an electronic device, like a mobile phone. I hope books won’t go totally away.”  She also expects more transmedia — taking a book or a play and adapting it to another media. An example is “Superman,” which started as a comic book and then was adapted into graphic novels, a television series, movies, games, clothing and merchandise, she said.  Because of the mobility of technology, short-form webisodes are likely to increase as well.  “I see students all the time that are always on their phones,” Tennant said. “Many of them don’t read stories, but I think they would identify with a story if it were put into a context where it was interesting and multimedia could be added.”  But while the manner in which a story is told may change, its structure won’t, Tennant said.  “There are unique ways of telling a story that have been developed, whether it’s telling a story forward or backward, like the ‘Star Wars’ prequel and sequel, but the actual structure of stories hasn’t changed, nor will it ever,” Tennant said.  “Since the days of Aristotle and Shakespeare and all the way back to Homer,” the structure of stories has remained constant, she said. “They have to have a beginning, a middle and an ending.”  Courtesy: Richard Schneider, IU Communications   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

In this facilitated experiential learning context, students have been able to develop their voices as filmmakers while actively engaging with Parian culture.  [60 films](https://vimeo.com/showcase/5376684)  From 2017- 2021, Lewis worked on Opioid Stories , a project that examined the impact of the opioid epidemic in Indiana through a series of narrative films, first-person interviews, and a documentary. These films tell the stories of those affected and those who work to confront the problem. Students worked in the planning, production, and post-production of these films. The Long Run , a documentary that follows the story of Wes Doty who overcame addiction to become a dedicated marathon runner, was an official selection at Heartland’s Indy Shorts Film Festival, the Indianapolis Film Festival in 2021, and was screened in festivals across the US.  [Opioid Stories](http://opioidstories.org/)  Prior to working on Opioid Stories , Lewis took two filmmaking trips to Kenya in which he developed several films that explored the stigma and lack of information around HIV. Working cross-disciplinarily with medical professionals and an anthropologist, Lewis collaborated with students at Moi University to create the series. These films have been shown at festivals across the US and Africa. The making of these films was presented at the 21 st International Aids Conference in Durban, South Africa.  [These films](http://hiv-films.org/)  Not only does Lewis explore the possibilities of filmmaking with his socially impactful documentary and narrative work, but he also pushes the boundaries of what is possible within the field of video art. Since 2012, he has explored how video-mapping technologies can provide an audience with an immersive experience in which they can ask questions about the nature of perception. Most recently, he contributed a video-mapping installation to Fix: Heartbreak and Hope in Our Opioid Crisis , on view at the Indiana State Museum.  Lewis received his M.F.A. in film from CalArts in 1993, where he studied with filmmakers James Benning, Thom Andersen, and Betzy Bromberg. He then worked professionally in video and film production in Los Angeles for sixteen years. From 2001 to 2009, he produced DVD bonus materials for major motion pictures, including the Harry Potter franchise.  Lewis brings the experiences of his rigorous and ongoing creative practice back into the classroom. He teaches by doing—demonstrating how to challenge oneself, be open to learning, and adapt to the changing landscape of emergent video technologies. As a practicing filmmaker, he shares with his students that being a filmmaker is a not simply a title, but a lens for constant engagement as a participant in the world.   ### Research Interests   ### Courses  NEWM N353 Intermediate Digital Video  [NEWM N353](https://luddy.iupui.edu/courses/newm-n353/)  NEWM N354 Directorial Analysis, Production, and RAW Workflow  [NEWM N354](https://luddy.iupui.edu/courses/newm-n354/)  NEWM-N 356 Lighting and Field Production  [NEWM-N 356](https://luddy.iupui.edu/courses/newm-n356/)  NEWM N357 Digital Effects  [NEWM N357](https://luddy.iupui.edu/courses/newm-n357/)  NEWM N456 Digital Cinema  [NEWM N456](https://luddy.iupui.edu/courses/newm-n456/)  NEWM-N 468 Video for Social Change  [NEWM-N 468](https://luddy.iupui.edu/courses/newm-n468/)   ### Outside Media   ### Short film ‘Michael’ is long on impact  IUPUI’s own C.

    "body": "  ## Documentary film career taking off for MAS alumnus Sam Mirpoorian  September 29, 2023  (photo provided by Sam Mirpoorian)  Every story has a beginning, a middle, and an end. For Luddy alumnus Sam Mirpoorian, that story arc is on a rapid rise, with no end in sight. With a number of documentary shorts “in the can” along with more than several awards and recognitions, Mirpoorian can start to consider himself established as a producer/director, even more so with his recent film purchased by PBS’ acclaimed series, Independent Lens, via national television broadcast premiere.  [documentary shorts](https://workofmiro.com/)  Mirpoorian’s trajectory began in high school and continued through undergraduate and graduate Media Arts and Science (MAS) programs at Luddy Indianapolis. In 2016, he was a college senior and had just produced “ Under the Bridge: The Criminalization of Homelessness ,” which received Indy Film Fest’s “Best of Hoosier Lens Award”, and was working on “ Little Warriors .”  The heart-warming story of local middle schoolers petitioning the city of Indianapolis to take action on climate change, the short documentary film won Heartland Film Festival’s Indiana Spotlight Film Award in 2017.  [Media Arts and Science](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/undergraduate/media-arts/video-sound/)  [Under the Bridge: The Criminalization of Homelessness](https://luddy.iupui.edu/news/story/student-film-under-the-bridge)  [Little Warriors](https://luddy.iupui.edu/news/story/mas-students-heartland-film-fest)  He went on to work as editor and co-producer on “ Destination Park” in 2018, along with fellow alumnus Brenton Oechsle, and the two helped premiere the film at Tribeca Film Festival in 2018. A couple years later, he was back on the circuit with “Sonnie”, which received great acclaim and multiple awards.  [Destination Park”](https://luddy.iupui.edu/news/story/mas-alumni-tribeca-film-fest)  Since then he has worked on”Greener Pastures”; now showing at the Heartland International Film Festival in October 2023.  Thomas Lewis, video faculty and director of the Media Arts and Science program at Luddy Indianapolis, said, “It has been great to see Sam’s talent and tenacity paying off with the completion of so many high-quality films. I love that our alums are making a difference in the world with their skills.”  Mirpoorian always has five to 10 ideas that he is developing and said it’s not uncommon to have two in production at the same time. He said there are many variables for which films get noticed. “Relationships matter, who you know, how hard you work, luck, timing, quality, story.” And it is non-stop promoting once the film is made.  He noted that the film scene is good in Indianapolis, although not as strong as in Cincinnati and Louisville. But it is a cheaper city to work in for independents and offers unique and interesting environments in which to film.  If Mirpoorian has a brand—and he doesn’t claim one yet—it is his focus on societal issues, shining a light on the people that are disaffected and striving to do better. We could all use a little more of that perspective these days. Catch his latest doc, “Greener Pastures,” while it’s in town, and see for yourself.

    "body": "  ## James Ward: Into the Animator-Verse  March 20, 2019  James Ward came to the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI after hearing about it from a visiting speaker at a junior college he went to. He was looking into four-year colleges to transfer to, but most were out of state and were going to put him way more into debt than he was comfortable with. When he heard there was a new school in Indianapolis that offered what he wanted to study and it was affordable, it was a no brainer. Ward majored in Media Arts and Science and graduated in 2007.  Flash forward to early 2018. Ward, who started his career at Plow Games in Indianapolis and completed online animation school, was hard at work creating shots for a new picture at Sony Imageworks. The project, called Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, would go on to be awarded both a Golden Globe and an Oscar for best animated film of 2018.  “I knew Spider-Verse would be something special the moment I saw the test footage, but I had no idea it would speak to so many people as it has.” James Ward  Ward recently reflected back on his time at the school and shared some insights. For him, the highlights were the 2D and 3D animation classes and having access to the computer labs for long hours. Faculty were also very accessible, offering lots of help outside class. He also mentioned the great extracurricular activities like SIGGRAPH that would bring in speakers and hold animation competitions.  Ward encouraged students to be as active and passionate as they can, get involved at school and online, and get to know fellow students with the same passions. Those friends can become valuable connections. Also, he said that students shouldn’t expect to go into school thinking they will be handed everything they need to succeed—they have to work for it.  “There are lots of paths to take in animation currently. You can work in independent shorts, video games, TV animation, film animation. I think it’s easy to have your focus only on the big studios like Pixar, Disney, and Dreamworks. I had never heard of Sony Imageworks before I saw them at the job fair and now after almost 10 years working for them, I can say I wouldn’t want to work anywhere else. Don’t be discouraged if you can’t get in to those big dream studios, I was turned down countless times. And now years later I’m turning down offers from those studios. Take the job that works for you,” Ward advised.  Ward moved to San Diego to be closer to industry and work on his reel. Once he had one he was happy with, he attended a job fair at the CTN Animation Expo in LA. A few weeks later he got the call from Sony.  Now a senior animator, Ward has worked on a variety of movies and games through the years, including “Green Lantern,” “Oz the Great and Powerful,” “The Smurfs 2,” “Alice Through the Looking Glass,” “The Amazing Spider-Man” and others. Other than working at his desk, he takes a lot of reference—acting out and recording what needs to be animated—often including others. For example, his wife appears in one of the school scenes in Spider-Verse. Currently, Ward is working on Spider-Man: Far From Home.  “The best part of my job is seeing the movie I worked on in the theater. All the hard work put into a project by so many people for so many months up on the big screen and seeing your name in the credits is extremely rewarding,” Ward said.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Bioinformatics Student Develops App to Forecast the Flu  March 24, 2015  A bioinformatics master’s student in the Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI helped develop a mobile app that one day may be used to forecast outbreaks of seasonal flu and other illnesses.  Sandeep Shantaram and other student researchers developed the prototype application as interns at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory for the Biosurveillance Mobile App Development Competition, an annual challenge sponsored by the laboratory and the U.S. Department of Defense. The competition was funded by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA).  The mobile app called FluCast, won the competition and is now undergoing testing and development through DTRA’s Biosurveillance Ecosystem (BSVE) program.  The competition focused on exploring solutions to biosurveillance challenges, demonstrating how mobile devices enable access to health care information and resources, making them an ideal option for addressing the needs of digital disease detection.  “FluCast focuses on risk assessment and seasonal flu forecasting using historic flu case information in correlation with weather data and social media to provide a real-time flu risk assessment,” Shantaram said. A collaboration platform for analytics and an RSS feed of flu-related news and Twitter mentions are also features of the FluCast.  “The FluCast app can be used to keep track of what is happening in the biological world, monitor it, and draw attention to areas where there might be anticipated issues,” Shantaram said. “The app would provide the ability to capture data like geographic location, track any noticeable issues of concern and provide the information such that protocols could be communicated, and implemented to reduce the risk of epidemics or outbreaks, like that experienced with the Ebola outbreak.”    About Pacific Northwest National Laboratory  Interdisciplinary teams at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory address many of America’s most pressing issues in energy, the environment and national security through advances in basic and applied science.  Founded in 1965, PNNL employs 4,300 staff, has an annual budget of more than $1 billion. It is managed by Battelle for the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Science. As the single largest supporter of basic research in the physical sciences in the United States, the Office of Science is working to address some of the most pressing challenges of our time.

This non-stop event begins at 6:00 p.m. on Friday, January 15 at the Informatics and Communication Technology Complex on the IUPUI campus. The date leads into the University’s annual Martin Luther King, Jr. Day of Service encouraging students, faculty and staff to give back to the greater Indianapolis community.  Indianapolis web professionals will lead teams of student volunteers from the School’s informatics and media arts and science programs throughout this unique service learning opportunity. “This is a fun and challenging way for our students to learn from some of the top professionals in the city while also giving their time and energy to a greater cause,” said Mark McCreary, Assistant Dean for Student Services at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI. Professionals donating their services to the cause include creative talent from Justify Studios, Squish Designs, Web Easy Media and Cassis Design.  Non-profit organizations were identified by the IUPUI Solution Center and chosen based on a demonstrated need for a new or enhanced website, as well as their future ability to maintain that website. “It’s important that these websites be easily sustainable given non-profit’s often limited resources,” explained Justin Harter of RefreshIndy. “Our goal is to simply help strengthen these organizations’ online identities so they can better serve our community.”  Non-profits selected to receive redesigned websites include the following local organizations: Talbot House, a residential care facility for adult males recovering from alcoholism and substance abuse; Progress House, a recovery center for alcohol and/or drug dependent men; and My Sister’s Place, a service providing transitional support and resources for formerly incarcerated and at-risk women and their families.  “The impact of this is huge,” said Carol Wellman, MSW, Director of My Sister’s Place. “I developed our website myself using a book, so receiving this type of expert assistance is invaluable. It helps us increase visibility and communication with the women, families and organizations who need our services.”  To learn more about this event, please visit www.refreshindy.com/48hours.html.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

The Department of BioHealth Informatics brings together expertise from biological, biomedical and health sciences, and addresses the strong industrial and academic demand for graduates with expertise in these related informatics specialties.   ### What is BioHealth Informatics?  BioHealth Informatics (BHI) is an interdisciplinary field that studies and pursues the effective uses of biomedical data, information, and knowledge for scientific inquiry, problem solving, and decision making, driven by efforts to improve human health. BHI investigates and supports reasoning, modeling, simulation, experimentation, and translation across the spectrum from molecules to individuals and to populations, from biological to social systems, bridging basic and clinical research and practice and the healthcare enterprise. BHI builds on and contributes to computer and information sciences and technologies, emphasizing their application in biomedicine. BHI further develops, studies, and applies theories, methods, and processes for the generation, storage, retrieval, use, management, and sharing of biomedical data, information, and knowledge.  Finally, BHI recognizes that people are the ultimate users of biomedical information, and therefore draws upon the social and behavioral sciences to inform the design and evaluation of technical solutions, policies, and the evolution of economic, ethical, social, educational, and organizational systems. BHI can be subdivided into a number of related disciplines, including bioinformatics, translational informatics, health informatics, clinical informatics, and health information management. Our department represents the broad spectrum of education, research and practice in these areas.   ### HIM Mission & Vision  Learn about the health information management program's mission and vision.

    "body": "  ## Deadline to apply for HIT certificate program is Sept. 15  August 29, 2012  Recent studies show the healthcare industry is likely to increase the hiring of health informaticists with both clinical and technical skills over the next two years, making this an ideal time to enroll in Health Information Technology certificate courses.    In collaboration with Regenstrief Institute, an internationally respected biomedical and public health informatics innovator dedicated to improving health by enhancing the quality and delivery of medical care, and the IU School of Medicine, the School of Informatics and Computing is once again offering specialized one-year IU graduate certificate programs, which are designed to increase the number of health IT specialists in Indiana and nationwide, thanks in part to funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009. Deadline to apply for spring 2013 is Sept. 15. For questions regarding the possibility of receiving tuition assistance, please contact Mandy Nyhuis (amnyhuis@regenstrief.org).  “HIT is booming from all different aspects, and yet, folks are not properly trained in how to use or implement the systems. What we’ve seen, anecdotally, is that employees are getting pushed more into managing HIT systems or implementing HIT systems who haven’t had the formal training and education to do so,” said J.T. Finnell, director and associate professor of Health Informatics. “Indiana is, without a doubt, a national leader in HIT. The windfall from the federal ARRA funds supports that fact. These funds are helping us combat the shortage of HIT workers in Indiana so we can sustain and strengthen the state’s HIT might.”  Finnell, who is also associate professor of emergency medicine for the Indiana University School of Medicine and research scientist for the Regenstrief Institute, said for those healthcare or information technology professionals interested in learning new skills and increasing job security, the one-year graduate programs in HIT are something to consider.  Each of the five programs is designed to develop much-needed and qualified health IT leaders for private and public health care organizations. These training programs include:  Certificate in Clinical Informatics (Clinician Leader)  Certificate in Informatics for Public Health Professionals (Public Health Leader)  Certificate in Informatics in Health Information Management and Exchange (Health Information Management Exchange Specialist)  Certificate in Informatics in Health Information Security (Health Information Privacy and Security Specialist)  Certificate in Informatics in Health Information Systems Architecture (Programmer and Software Engineer)  Qualified applicants must hold a four-year or advanced degree from an accredited institution and may include the following (please see the “Checklist for Accepted Students” document for tuition support eligibility details):  Detailed information on the programs to be offered in the spring of 2013 and link to the application can be found at www.in-info-web2.https://luddy.iupui.edu/HITtraining.

    "body": "  ## Media Arts students’ video project features 2012 Paralympians  August 29, 2012  Media Arts and Science students Eric Isenhart, Mark Hicks and Michael Hicks have gained a greater appreciation for athletes with disabilities thanks to a recent project they completed as part of Associate Professor Edgar Huang’s “Advanced Video” class.    The trio produced a promotional video for the Rehabilitation Hospital of Indiana (RHI), which introduced them to several youth and adult athletes who, despite struggles with spinal cord, orthopedic, neuromuscular or visual impairments, are excelling in their sports  –  and life.  At the time of filming, some of these athletes were even Paralympic hopefuls, and were training for the chance to compete in the 2012 Paralympics which opens in London today. One of RHI’s athletes  –  Cat Bouwkamp, a wheelchair fencer  – qualified for the 2012 U.S. Paralympic team. She is featured in the video. Learn more about her and other athletes here:  http://rhin.com/category/athletics/athletes/  Isenhart, a senior from Champaign, Ill., learned that RHI wanted a video highlighting the hospital’s sports program for its website and for promotional and fund-raising use. So the students developed a plan, presented their ideas and began scheduling shoots that same week.  “I didn’t know anyone personally who participated in these sports before I began the project,” Michael Hicks, a senior from Avon, said. His brother, Mark, is a junior MAS student, also from Avon. “Throughout the course of doing the project we met a lot of different athletes who inspired us throughout the production. Working with nine different sports, we were able to meet a lot of different people.”  He said that was his favorite part of the project, as they were able to talk with athletes who compete in everything from wheelchair fencing, archery, handcycling, water skiing, wheelchair tennis, wheelchair basketball, track, racing, quad rugby, power soccer and beep baseball.  “It was a very interesting and eye-opening experience,” he said. “Everyone we met was very friendly and welcoming, which made filming a comfortable experience.”  RHI premiered the video at its annual gala at Old National Centre, with more than 400 people in attendance.  “Our video was played before the donation portion of the program and they raised more money than any other year,” Michael Hicks said. “They seemed to very much enjoy our video and were happy with our final result.”  Jacob Patrick, program coordinator for RHI’s Sports Program, agreed the video had a positive impact.  “We made $1,500 more at this year’s gala than we ever had before and donations were accepted right after the video was shown. So I think it had a good impact,” Patrick said. “The video turned out great. We were on a time crunch and didn’t have a lot of editing time, so we were trusting them to put it all together and see how it turned out. It definitely turned out great.”  Hicks added that the most challenging part was scheduling and planning the shoots, then having to make last-minute adjustments due those schedules.  “The schedule was something that kept us on our toes throughout the project,” he said. “My advice to anyone working on this type of project would be to make sure you plan everything as thoroughly as you can. You never know when something you planned isn’t going to work and you have to switch around your whole schedule. Leave plenty of room for changes.”  Since 2005, RHI Sports has been identified as a United States Paralympic Sports Club an official Indiana training partner to aid in the development of youth and adult athletes for world class competition. To date, the Sports Program has sent 12 athletes and coaches across the country and around the world for education, training, and competition.  The Paralympic Games first took place in Rome in 1960 and featured 400 athletes from 28 countries. As the years have passed, the Paralympic Games have grown bigger and become more high profile, becoming the second largest sporting event in the world, after the Olympic Games. The London 2012 Paralympic Games will see 4,280 athletes compete – the largest number ever to attend. More than 530 gold medals will be awarded over the course of the 11 days of competition.

Students and school staff handed out sunglasses to elementary-, middle-, and high school-age fans who showed up to see how subjects like math, science, and history can be applied to America’s favorite pastime.    LiFT student Dallas Rian Bucker threw out the first pitch after Senior Executive Associate Dean Mathew J. Palakal welcomed everyone to the game. Faculty member Zebulun Wood was interviewed live during the game on 97.5 Fox Sports about the opportunities available at the School of Informatics and Computing.    “It’s always a great day when we get to brag about our students, their innovative projects, our awesome faculty, and the School of Informatics and Computing. It is a red letter day when we get to do it in the company of baseball fans. I played baseball from when I was five years old through three years of college, so it was a special day for me personally. I was honored by the opportunity to reminisce and represent our school,” Wood said.  The Indianapolis Indians Baseball in Education Days program is an annual event designed to show students that baseball can be educational and learning can be fun. The School of Informatics and Computing offers a variety of technology-forward degree programs that might appeal to those students interested in athletics—whether on the diamond, the court, or on a video screen—and that demonstrate that informatics really is everywhere.  A bachelor’s degree in Media Arts and Science is good preparation for creating animated or virtual and augmented reality sports games, while the master’s in Sports Analytics may lead to a career in the big leagues as a data analyst. Informatics students can also study the dynamics of batting, throwing, and pitching; create ways for athletes to track their health; or document the history of the game through digitized archival records—to name just a few of many applications.     ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Data science faculty receives $216K NSF grant to address wildlife trafficking  November 2, 2022  Sunandan Chakraborty , assistant professor, Data Science in the Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI has been awarded a $216,590 National Science Foundation grant for his project “An Interdisciplinary Approach to the Discovery, Analysis, and Disruption of Wildlife Trafficking Networks.” Chakraborty is Principal Investigator on The Disrupting Operations of Illicit Supply Networks (D-ISN) project, which is a collaborative effort between IU, NYU, and CUNY.  [Sunandan Chakraborty](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/sunandan-chakraborty/)  Interpol estimates the illegal trade in wildlife  to be worth up to USD 20 billion per year (Source: UNEP-INTERPOL Report: The Rise of Environmental Crime). Wild flora and fauna can be exploited by criminals along the entire supply chain, from poaching and transportation to processing and selling. Other illegal activities are often associated with wildlife crimes, including money laundering, corruption and document fraud.        According to the grant abstract, “This project aims to address the illegal trade in wild animals. Wildlife trafficking is one of the most common illicit activities globally and poses a substantial human cost along with detrimental social and economic impacts, including increased crime, violence, and environmental destruction. The COVID-19 pandemic, likely the result of a virus that spread to humans from a wildlife market, demonstrates that wildlife trafficking can have serious public health and biosafety implications.”  This project seeks to catalyze technological innovations by creating tools that empower domain experts to continuously discover and obtain actionable insights by exploring the wealth of data related to illicit networks that spread over multiple sources. The project will advance our nation’s ability to counter wildlife trafficking activities through novel approaches for data discovery, analytics, and modeling. The project will also promote the progress of research in criminal activities that have an online footprint. Data collected in the course of the project will be made publicly available through a dataset search engine, making it possible for researchers to enrich data-driven analyses through the dynamic discovery and linkage of previously unknown data, and allowing them to answer important questions. The project team’s collaboration with non-governmental organizations and discussions with law enforcement agencies will facilitate an interactive process that can fine-tune disruption techniques and suggest pragmatic real-world implementation strategies and policy recommendations.  “Wildlife trafficking is one of the most common illicit activities globally, and it is one of the greatest threats to biodiversity. We see significant increase in these activities as online platforms create new channels to connect sellers and buyers involved in this illegal trade. Coping with the more recent trends requires the development of innovative technologies that will provide enforcement agencies with powerful tools and the civil society to be more aware and stop this practice. In this project, we aim to design new algorithms and techniques to discover connections and relationships across disparate data sources, as well as to empower domain experts to interrogate large collections for data discovery and analytics and eventually to understand and disrupt illicit networks,” Chakraborty said.   ### Interdisciplinary methods and tools advance data research  The project uses an interdisciplinary approach—combining methods and tools from computer science and engineering as well as wildlife criminology to advance the state of the art and build fundamental knowledge in methods for the discovery and exploration of data related to illicit activities with an online footprint, as well as enhance wildlife trafficking research. Specifically, this project contributes new algorithms that provide capabilities to: 1) discover and automatically collect data related to wildlife trafficking from multiple platforms at an unprecedented scale; and 2) use these data to build computational models and study wildlife trafficking patterns and networks at the global level.  Through the use of analytical techniques such as crime mapping, quantitative data analysis, and social network analysis, this project will address research questions related to the scale and the nature of illicit wildlife trade, network structures of online wildlife trafficking, and empirically-driven disruption models that can be used to best tackle them. The algorithms are adaptable to different domains and data, support the discovery of both unstructured data and structured datasets, and will serve as the basis for usable tools that empower domain experts to continuously discover and monitor relevant data.  Davide Bolchini, professor and Human-Centered Computing department chair, said “We are very happy to see that the NSF awarded this important interdisciplinary project to our faculty. This is exemplary research that advances AI for addressing the pervasive problems of illegal trafficking.   By identifying computational methods to combat illegal trade networks that are concealed from public view and use a variety of online disguises to circumvent the law, Sunandan’s AI work in this area has the potential to have a larger, positive societal impact.”  [Human-Centered Computing](https://luddy.iupui.edu/hcc/)  This award reflects NSF’s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation’s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.   ### NSF Disclaimer  Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

[Angela Murillo](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/angela-murillo/)  The Library and Information Science (LIS) and Human-Centered Computing departments are collaborating with Murillo, who developed the curriculum for a new program in information science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill while she was a doctoral student there. She comes to the school with 15 years of experience in academia, government, and business.  “This new degree program allows our department to fill a critical gap in the school’s curriculum,” says Andrea Copeland , associate professor of library and information science and chair of the LIS department.  [Andrea Copeland](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/andrea-copeland/)  The School of Informatics and Computing expects to offer the new major in the 2018–19 academic year, with two specializations—one in applied data science and one in information science. The first course in the forthcoming major, Foundations of Data Studies , is now available for student enrollment. Murillo and other LIS faculty members are currently creating the additional courses for the undergraduate program.  [Foundations of Data Studies](https://luddy.iupui.edu/courses/lis-s201/)  Skills like data manipulation, curation, organization, and visualization will offer students a head start in the workforce and preparation for graduate studies. Demand for these highly transferable skills is increasing—especially in the handling of big data—as are the salaries in data science careers.  Murillo holds a Ph.D. in library and information science from UNC Chapel Hill and undergraduate degrees in geoscience, English, and Spanish. Her professional experience includes past positions as a working group member for DataONE—a National Science Foundation DataNet program—and as a research and development information scientist at Novozymes, an environmental sustainability biotech firm.  “We are all thrilled by the opportunity to develop this new program with Angela Murillo,” says Copeland. “Her academic and professional background bring perspectives of the ‘bigger picture’ to teaching and learning about data, relating data to its social and ethical implications, the curatorial processes, and the quantitative analyses involved in the data life cycle.”  We are all creators, producers, and consumers of data, says Murillo, and all students can benefit from understanding that interaction with the world. “Analysis is everywhere—especially in the media—and critical thinking is necessary,” she says. “Data fluency is foundational to making students more competitive, giving them skills and confidence in any context.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Informational Interview  One way to begin building your network is by conducting informational interviews (career conversations). Informational interviews are brief meetings with people who are established in a particular career field. The interviews are a learning opportunity for you to ask their perspective on their job, the company, the future of the field, and how they grew to where they are today. This interview can be conducted either in person, online, or by phone. In either case, ask the individual you are contacting if you may visit with them for a specific period for an informational interview.  Note that you are not asking for a job interview nor are you asking for a job in the future. The objective is to obtain information that may be useful for you in making decisions involved in your career planning and in the job search process. People are usually very open to speaking with students who are approaching the job market and are eager to pass on advice. Don’t be shy about reaching out, but keep in mind a few general rules:   ### General Etiquette   ### Interview Formats   #### Email/Online Messaging Format   #### Subject Line  Use a subject line that makes a connection. If you don’t include a subject line and the individual does not recognize your name, it is likely that your message will be deleted before it is read.   #### Introduction  State your name, school, year, major, and how you received their information.   #### Body  This should be the goal of your email.   #### Closing  Thank them for their time.  After successfully setting up a meeting, develop an agenda with specific questions you want to ask. For example:   #### Phone Call/Meeting Format   #### Introduction  State your name, school, year, major, and how you received their information.   #### Body  This should be the goal of your call.   #### Closing  Ask for referrals or about openings with their company. Send them your resume.  Things to remember: "

The collaboration harnesses the medical expertise of St. Francis clinicians and the technological prowess of Medical Animatics, an Indianapolis-based company specializing in medical and scientific visualizations.  The Web-based education portal, appropriately named “MyInformedChoice ®,” is designed to provide patients with a full complement of educational content. Patients can logon using any Internet enabled personal computer. Patients can then access , the visually rich presentation that includes 2-D and 3-D animations, audio narration, surgical video and interactive tools.  The multimedia program guides users through the process of what takes place during bariatric and gastric banding procedures, including the benefits and risks. They also can view the various aspects of follow-up care they can expect during recovery.  “This technology educates patients with easy-to-understand information and the most visually accurate details, enabling them to make informed choices about their health care,” said Eve Olson, M.D., medical director of the Weight Loss Center and a member of the St. Francis Medical Group. “It also uses patients’ informed consent designed to improve their medical outcomes and future wellness.”  Patients can access the site at any time and share it with others.  “Having this information at a patient’s or family member’s fingertips can make a difference in understanding this life-changing surgery,” said Kim Peters, R.N., bariatric coordinator.  Once patients have been approved for surgery at St. Francis, they can complete the informed consent portion of the program.  “We’re excited to bring this cutting edge technology to patients who are considering bariatric surgery at St. Francis Weight Loss Center,” said Harlon Wilson, president and CEO of Medical Animatics. “Patients who use this innovative tool have demonstrated significant improvements in learning about medical treatment. St. Francis is an excellent example of a forward-thinking hospital that embraces innovative technology in support of improving their patients’ outcomes.

    "body": "  ## MAS alumnus crosses the finish line with Resilience Racing  May 18, 2020  ( feature photo by Meg Leigh of Meg Leigh Photography, used with permission )  In late 2018, then Media Arts and Science (MAS) graduate student Clark Knittle was looking for a thesis project to complete his degree. At the same time, then Indianapolis Motor Speedway (IMS) events director Kirk Dooley needed media content for a new program, which he now directs full-time, aptly named Resilience Racing .  [Resilience Racing](https://www.resilienceracingfoundation.org/)  A chance meeting brought the two of them together, in what Knittle described as “pretty much the perfect situation for both of us.” Soon after, Knittle began planning, creating, executing ninety percent of the media strategy for the team’s first event.  The Resilience Racing program was designed for and by a team of disabled veterans, who train to drive specially equipped cars. Knittle, a self-professed motor racing fan, shot and edited video, created content for social media, and produced a short documentary about the team’s first race event.  [a short documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDocGCGKzIY)  “I learned a great deal from my experience with Resilience. I had to relearn things I thought I knew and learned an incredible amount overall. I learned how fast-paced shooting is for dynamic events like a race. I learned a little bit about social media strategy. And I learned how to shoot documentaries—up until then I had only created 60 to 90 second videos,” Knittle said.  Knittle earned a B.S. in Telecommunications from Ball State in 2010 and was working as a Markets Editor for Tourdesign Creative services in Carmel, putting together television commercials for touring musical artists like Beyonce, Jay-Z, Maroon 5, and Usher, when he decided to return to IUPUI for his master’s degree.  Knittle said he chose the master’s program in MAS at the School of Informatics and Computing because it was different than what was being offered at other universities in the state. “It still had a focus on producing content, but it was more focused on diving deeper into the subjects of design, and the design process. The location and time of the classes was also convenient, because I live on the north-east side of Indy, and I was working full time while getting my degree,” he said.  MAS graduate program co-director Joseph Defazio says the degree was designed with working adults in mind and with the help of industry leaders. “Clark is the type of student that propels that MAS Graduate Program to success. He exemplifies the type of student who navigated his graduate degree using professional and industry experience. The quality of his work and academic achievements are stellar,” Defazio said.  [Joseph Defazio](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/joseph-defazio/)  Knittle started out focused on more advanced technology like Virtual and Augmented reality, but after a particular project in one of his classes, he changed focus to video production. “I chose to switch to video production because I already have a background in it, and I wanted to advance my skill set further. I also was able to find a subject that I wanted to cover,” he said.  Knittle offered this advice to others working in the field: If you’re looking to advance your skills, or take a different direction in media while taking a more in depth look at the process of design in general, this is an excellent program. “The program is top notch, the professors are actively involved in helping you succeed in your goals for school, and for your future career,” Knittle said. “In every class they’ve asked at least once, what do you want to do when you graduate, and where do you want to end up?”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Second annual iDEW Day showcases IUPUI  October 30, 2018  ( Story submitted by Tina Rice, iDEW Outreach Coordinator )  On September 14, 2018 more than 240 students from five high schools converged onto the IUPUI campus to participate in the 2nd Annual iDEW Day. The annual event allows high school students to hear from IT industry leaders, tour the IUPUI campus, get an in-depth look at academic units, and learn about the resources the university has to offer.  The School of Informatics and Computing hosts the event and invites students who participate in the Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce (iDEW) program. This year, 10th to 12th grade students from five of the eight iDEW schools—Pike, Providence Cristo Rey, George Washington Community, Arsenal Technical, and McKenzie Center for Innovation and Technology—participated. The School of Informatics and Computing, Herron School of Art + Design, Kelley School of Business, the School of Science, the School of Engineering and Technology, and the School of Nursing, along with school resources, 21st Century Scholars, Multicultural Center, Diversity Enrichment and Achievement Program, and the Admissions office, were all engaged in this year’s event.  [Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce](https://luddy.iupui.edu/idew/)  The students and the school units agreed that the event was what they were looking for, in regard to being able to engage and learn more about what IUPUI has to offer prospective students.  “I like that the students were given the opportunity to visit different schools and learn about school resources,” said JaMon Pascall, Assistant Director of Admissions, Kelley School of Business. “The students who visited our school were extremely engaged, and those who were not able to (visit) reached out to us during the resource fair. I am looking forward to the School of Business continuing to be a part of this event,” he added.  iDEW Day accomplished its goal of showcasing some of what IUPUI has to offer. The event began with Vic Oditah, Technical Account Manager at Genesys, and Jim Lyst, School of Informatics and Computing faculty member and iDEW curriculum designer, welcoming the students to campus. The welcome was followed by each resource unit giving the students an overview of the resources they offer students. Before arriving to campus, each student was given the opportunity to choose two different school units to visit during the day. Students were allowed to visit the resource fair before and after they visited their school units of choice.  “Being a part of iDEW Day actually helped me to see myself being a student at IUPUI. I like that we were given the opportunity to visit different schools and get a glimpse of what IUPUI has to offer,” said Anthony Jones, Arsenal Technical High School junior.   ### About iDEW  Through community partnerships iDEW attracts high schoolers to informatics and computing with innovative programs, providing a successful and diverse workforce that can power the digital economy. At their schools, hundreds of Indiana students have taken iDEW classes, which follow a project-based curriculum designed by IUPUI faculty. This nationally recognized STEM program for high school students, created in 2015 by the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, focuses on opportunities for women and underrepresented minority students.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

Teaching Button-Pushing versus Teaching Thinking: The State of New Media Education in US Universities was published in “Convergence, the International Journal of Research Into New Media Technologies”.  Huang’s research focused on how the teaching of thinking skills and that of technological skills has been balanced in U.S. new media programs to produce both employable graduates and life-long learners. Huang found that most programs have balanced the two skill sets, but that more effort should be made to integrate the teaching of both skill sets in individual courses to give students an expedited, holistic learning experience.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## From automotives to investments: an Applied Data Science alumna’s career journey  November 18, 2021  Swarnamouli Majumdar has followed a somewhat unique career trajectory that has taken her from the midwest to the northeast United States and from automobile engines to autonomous vehicles to the stock exchange, demonstrating the flexibility and range of applied data science careers across industry verticals.  “I have been working in the IT industry across consulting, automotive, and now financial domains for almost eight years now. My career path has been a mix of education coupled with hand-on industry enrichment. I have always been excited by the vast realm of data science and predictive analytics, and, post my M.S in Applied Data Science , moving into this exciting domain has been very smooth and a life-changing experience,” she said.  [M.S in Applied Data Science](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/data-science/data-science-masters/)  Majumdar joined Cummins Engine in Columbus, Indiana, immediately after graduating with her master’s degree in May 2018. Working in the Engineering and IT Department, she focused on data analysis and predictive maintenance. The holistic experience added to the IT background she had before entering the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI . “I learned a lot about the automotive industry and every step was a wonderful learning experience for me,” Majumdar said. In mid-June 2020, she received an offer to join the Aptiv autonomous mobility team at Motional as Senior Engineer Data Analytics, taking on predictive analytics and metrics evaluation as part of the engineering team. The move to Boston and the new role taught her a lot. “I was part of a very dynamic team and worked across the globe with stakeholders and across cultures,” she said.  [School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI](https://luddy.iupui.edu/)  In August 2021, Majumdar made a career move into the Fintech industry, joining State Street as an Assistant Vice President in Product Analytics and Business Intelligence, working on one of the largest trading platforms in the financial assets industry. State Street Corporation is an American financial services and bank holding company headquartered in Boston with operations worldwide and is the second oldest continually operating United States bank.  “The impact of data science is huge,” Majumdar said. “Every single industry has its own ‘data science’ need. Data is the atom in every company; data science just is the word for all the marvelous, exciting analyses that can be generated with the data at hand. Every company today, ranging from aviation to manufacturing, government to consulting, is in need of talented data science professionals. By ‘data science’ professionals, I mean business analysts, data analysts, data engineers, business intelligence analysts, business intelligence specialists, data scientists, machine learning engineers, product analysts, and any role which involves intricate wrangling of data and generating insights.”  Majumdar said earning her M.S. in Applied Data Science was one of the best decisions she made. She pointed to the hands-on nature of classes and that her knowledge improved as she interacted with students from different backgrounds. She also noted how professors were very knowledgeable in their domains and made sure students were prepared for success. “It is not only the campus, the courses, and the knowledge gained—it is the overall holistic education gained that helped me move forward in life.” She said one specific aspect was that the degree was intra-linked with other departments at IUPUI. For instance, she was able to take classes from the biostatistics department and computer science departments, along with informatics core courses.  And she especially liked how helpful faculty were with making sure students understood every concept and how to apply them. Professors would often stay after class when students approached them with questions.  Her advice to students is to invest time outside of textbooks. Majumdar herself was part of a team of students that took part in the National Institute of Standards and Technology-sponsored Tech to Protect Challenge in 2019. The team advanced through several competition levels over a year’s time, winning well over $120K and impressing industry representatives with their solution to AI-enabled hands-free technology for law enforcement.  [Tech to Protect Challenge](https://luddy.iupui.edu/news/story/tech-to-protect-challenge-team)  She also recommends knowing basics the of statistics and machine learning, and understanding the granular level of concepts, not just learning programming languages but also programming basics that can be applied to any language/technology.  Data science is an interdisciplinary domain, Majumdar said. “Find out which aspect of data science is most exciting and map your career goals to your skills and interests. Don’t give in to the myth that you have to become a data scientist or a machine learning engineer if you study data science. There is a plethora of roles—the mantra is to look into the roles and responsibilities and see if they are a good fit for you.”  Majumdar is now pursuing a doctoral program in Management Information Systems with a research focus on responsible AI and machine learning from the University of Massachusetts Lowell.       ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## IUPUI, JP Morgan Chase and the Care Institute Group team up to address IT workforce development and the lack of diversity  November 14, 2014  The IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, in collaboration with JP Morgan Chase, and the Care Institute Group, recently announced their plans for a workforce development project, an initiative to teach information technology skills to local high school students to prepare them for academic and future career opportunities in the IT industry.  The iDEW program – Information Technology Diversity-Enhanced Workforce Initiative — will engage 90 high school students from three area high schools, Pike, Arsenal Tech, and Providence Christo Rey via a year-round enrichment program that will facilitate their progress towards earning 4-year college degrees. The initiative consists of a series of learning engagement modules (LEMs) focused on familiarizing students with core informatics and computing concepts, showcasing real-world application of those concepts, and introducing exciting career opportunities. All learning modules will have an overarching and interactive theme of “Computing for Social Cause.”  The goal of the iDEW initiative is to increase a diversity enriched IT workforce where the jobs are plentiful, but there is a lack of qualified, diverse candidates.  “Careers in information technology offer high wage employment opportunities and yet more than 35% of these jobs go unfilled in Central Indiana. JPMorgan Chase is excited to partner with Indiana University’s School of Informatics and Computing to pilot a program that allows high school students to earn dual college credit and industry recognized credentials in this field and encourage diversity of the IT workforce,” said Al Smith, Chairman, JPMorgan Chase Indiana.  Through the iDEW initiative there will also be a focus towards elevating the overall academic performance of the participating students as well as:  Proposed learning modules span from basic programming to creation of web sites and mobile applications to understanding the data behind DNA.  “We feel a sense of responsibility in assisting with the preparation of the workforce of the future. There are over 1.4 million unfilled jobs in the IT industry, and the number continues to grow. These jobs are high paying and available all over the United States. We want to insure the success of these high school students, by inspiring their interest in informatics & computing and providing them with the necessary skills to secure these jobs,” said Mathew Palakal, executive associate dean of the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI.  The iDEW initiative is scheduled to begin in the Fall of 2015.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## LIS-S 604 Topics in Library and Information Science  1-4 credits  [schedule](https://sisjee.iu.edu/sisigps-prd/web/igps/course/search/)   ### Description  Study of specific topics in librarianship and preservation. May be repeated for credit when topic varies. Same course number used for different courses.  Topics include:  Family Engagement in Libraries  This course focuses on all aspects of the concept: Family Engagement in Libraries. This topical seminar involves exploration of all aspects of family engagement both for children and young adults ages 0-18, as well as support for their parents, guardians, caregivers and educators. All types of literacies Including but not limited to digital literacy as well as traditional print literacies will be investigated.  Library Leadership  Library leadership develops leaders who lead change in positional and non-positional roles by creating experiences and spaces for participation and belonging to imagine and construct 21st century libraries and decolonial knowledge systems. This course distinguishes leadership from management. It establishes a safe space for critical dialogue that challenges norms and assumptions, systems, and practices that perpetuate injustices. Leadership identity is developed by situating leadership in historical, social organizational and community contexts to identify complex local/global issues that affect libraries and communities to practice leadership through critical dialogue, active listening and coaching. Library Leadership aims to fill a much-needed gap in LIS education and prepare generational leaders to address issues that impact information access and obstruct knowledge justice.  Inquiry and Innovation  This course is an introduction to the use of information inquiry processes, methods, techniques, and concepts with PK-12 students and other educators and librarians. Skills and processes associated with information literacy, media literacy, creative thinking, and critical thinking provide the foundation of the course design. Throughout the course students will be exploring and applying innovative integration of technology into curriculum development and programming. Timely topics such as administrating Learning Management Systems and designing curriculum for eLearning and 1:1 initiatives are included.  Tools for Digital Preservation  Building on the knowledge and skills acquired in LIS-S 582 (Digital Preservation), this course introduces students to practical tools for curating and preserving born-digital objects. Throughout the course, students will test and evaluate primarily free and/or open-source software designed to transfer, appraise (forensically), package, ingest, arrange, describe, and provide access to born-digital records. The course will also familiarize students with how to interact with digital files through a command line interface (shell) as a means for developing more efficient and scalable digital preservation workflows.  Legal Issues for Library and Information Managers  While you will not be able to learn every aspect of the law relating to libraries you will leave the course with a strong foundation to continue learning in these and new areas… we’ll dispel myths, practice how to think as courts, lawyers and “the law” thinks regarding legal issues in the library and how to approach and resolve problems of legal risk management in the library and related settings. This course will also prepare you to be an advocate for a variety of library and patron rights of access to and use of information in all its forms. Legal issues are becoming increasingly important in libraries and other information settings. The litigious nature of our society, the reactive nature of our legislative processes and at times the partisanship of our administrative agencies only exacerbate and complicate the challenges for librarians in navigating sound decision-making in this area. There is more law to understand now than 10 or 20 years ago when this course was first developed and taught; more court cases, statutes and administrative rule of direct relevance to libraries.  The prevalence of digital content requires a thorough understanding of copyright and contract (licensing). In our connected world patron informational privacy remains a bulwark of the librarian profession and its practice.  The Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment continues to drive our law and policy making in libraries, from access issues (meeting rooms, display cases, presence in the library, liberty interests, etc.) to content regulation (in-house and online collections) to information liability and malpractice for what some may call dangerous information, disinformation (“fake news”) or outdated information including information execution errors.  These concepts are explored in detail throughout the course, increasing the repertoire of tools with which the graduating librarian can enter practice.  Global Digital Services  This is a course for Study Abroad: Finland . This experience is comprised of two learning components. The first is a semester-long course taken by local students alongside others from Finland for a global classroom experience (graduate: LIS S531, undergraduate: INFO I400), and those traveling abroad will take an additional 3 credits starting in spring but terminating during summer session 1. LIS S604/S400 will offer students the opportunity to collaborate with students at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences in Helsinki, Finland. This course will begin in the spring semester and continue at our cooperating institution during summer I. In the spring semester, students from the IUPUI campus will be partnered with students from the Haaga-Helia campus and follow the course together via Canvas and other tools. The online course in the spring will provide technological and conceptual knowledge in skills such as HTML, CSS, and information architecture that will be practiced and refined in collaborative course projects. For Indiana University students who wish to go abroad, part of spring semester will also be devoted to academic sessions in anticipation of the international travel. All projects will be finalized at the end of spring semester but with the option to further collaborate with their partners. In the first half of summer session 1, students will have the opportunity to reconvene in Helsinki to discuss and pursue their projects with their collaborators at Haaga-Helia University. In Finland (not limited to Helsinki) the students’ activities will be supplemented by field trips and site visits relevant to the class as well as to Finnish culture in general via visits to historic sites, museums, industries, and cultural events. Our partner institution is Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences in Helsinki, Finland. However, we will not need to use classroom facilities at the University, although that is an option. Most lectures will have been accomplished before arrival. On-site activities include meetings, class visits, and lectures.  [Study Abroad: Finland](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/study-abroad/finland.html)  [Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences](https://www.haaga-helia.fi/en)  History and Methods of the Islamic Book  The history of books is the history of the world and in no field is that more true than the history of the Islamic book. This course will be an overview of the history of Islamic Manuscripts, preparing students to encounter Islamic manuscripts as LIS/GLAM professionals: Thus, this course will adopt a broad understanding of the term ‘Islamic’ to give students an inclusive, diverse view of the world of books in Muslim-majority lands (as well as their diasporas). The approach we take centers accessibility and reparative approaches so get ready to ask hard questions of the institutions we’re studying. Each week will introduce students to different aspects of the materiality of the book and issues around cataloging, artistry, digitization, rare book libraries, and museums. Students will be introduced to each material component of the Islamic manuscript, as well as its history. This course is global in its approach, introducing students to manuscripts from West Africa to Southeast Asia, spanning the 500s to the 1800s. Additionally, while students will learn basic handling principles and some aspects of conservation, this course will center the use of digital archives. Digital open-access archives for Islamic manuscripts, including digital library repositories, museum catalogs, and more, will be a constant in the course on a week-to-week basis.  Students will engage in critical analysis of archive accessibility including but not limited to user interface (UI)/user experience (UX) and the viability of digitization as an accessibility solution.  The course will prepare students to catalog and describe Islamic manuscripts, do research on Islamic manuscripts and give them a grounding in what Islamic manuscript collections exist globally and digitally. Students will read 60-100 pages a week and will write weekly response papers of 500-750 words on accessibility of the archives under consideration for that week. Students are also responsible for watching the weekly lecture. Knowledge of Arabic or any other non-European language is useful but not required. Non-DLIS students are also encouraged to enroll.  Social Issues in Archives  This course will introduce students to social, cultural, and critical theory in archival practice through scholarly literature, case studies, and the lived experiences of course participants. Students will consider how sociocultural factors such as race and ethnicity, indigeneity, gender, sexuality, class, citizenship status, and language manifest in the archival record. The course will also discuss the explicit, normative, and emerging obligations of archivists in relation to these elements and explore the outcomes of specific programs and practices. Drawing from the pedagogy of bell hooks and Paola Freire, students are expected to participate with active curiosity in critical dialogue. Drawing upon shared course readings, independent research, personal reflections, and lived experience, we will collectively respond to a series of “wicked problems” in archival practice. By the end of the course, students will demonstrate an understanding of archival practice through cross-disciplinary frameworks of sociocultural critique.   ### Program Learning Goals Supported  Instructors map their courses to specific LIS Program Goals .

    "body": "  ## Library and Information Science alumnus wins Oberly Award  April 19, 2017  IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI alumnus Michael Witt was recently named an Association of College and Research Libraries Science and Technology Section Oberly Award recipient for 2017.  Witt, who earned his master’s in Library Science in 2006, is an associate professor of library science at Purdue University and director of the Purdue University Research Repository.  The Oberly Award—named for Eunice Rockwood Oberly, former librarian of the Bureau of Plant Industry at the U.S. Department of Agriculture—is given biennially for the best English-language bibliography in the field of agriculture or a related science.  Witt and project collaborator Frank Scholze of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology were honored for their work on re3data.org , a registry of research data repositories that helps researchers, students, publishers, funding agencies, and librarians find the most appropriate repositories in which to deposit and discover research datasets.  [re3data.org](http://www.re3data.org/)  “Researchers are being required by funding agencies to share the data generated by grant-funded research,” Witt said. “They can search re3data.org to identify the best repository for them to deposit their datasets to satisfy these requirements—and to increase the impact of their research by sharing their data.”  Andrea Copeland , interim chair of the Department of Library and Information Science (LIS) at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, commended Witt. “Michael’s innovative and interdisciplinary research on data registries and repositories is having a significant impact on the research culture at Purdue University and beyond. He’s a library superstar, and I couldn’t be prouder that he’s a LIS alumnus,” Copeland said.

    "body": "  ## Andrew Miller receives NSF grant to study caregiving for young cancer patients  June 25, 2019  Andrew Miller, Ph.D., assistant professor of human-computer interaction (HCI) in the Department of Human-Centered Computing has received a two-year NSF CRII Smart and Connected Health Award of $174,791. He is principal investigator on the project entitled “Parent-2-Parent: Supporting Dyadic Caregiving in the Hospital” and will be collaborating with Dr. Emily Mueller of Riley Hospital for Children, Pediatric Hematology/Oncology department.  In this study, Miller will identify and demonstrate how social technologies can help parents to more effectively communicate and coordinate with each other during the hospitalization of their child. Miller will study these issues with families facing pediatric cancer, the leading cause of disease-related deaths in youth.  Miller’s study addresses two specific aims. First, Miller will characterize how parents currently communicate and coordinate with each other using current technology. Then, in collaboration with parents themselves, Miller will envision, demonstrate, and verify technologies to support them in new ways. To accomplish these aims, Miller and his team—in collaboration with Dr. Mueller—will conduct qualitative interviews, develop themes, and check these findings using broad surveys. Then Miller plans to build tools—in collaboration with parents—and test them in real-world settings.  When facing a health crisis such as a cancer diagnosis, parents must adopt new roles and responsibilities in addition to their parenting and spousal roles, which can lead to stress and potential mistakes. Miller says that patient safety is a “swiss cheese model” where errors can line up, and parents often feel they are the last line of defense.  “This grant is a participatory design project with parents, in which we are asking ‘How can communication tech support the parenting/family caregiving model in these extraordinary circumstances?,’” he says. In the past, social computing research on these issues has been informed by office practices, which is a less intense environment.  “There are many possible barriers to parents’ interaction with each other during a hospitalization, including nursing handoff, timing and time limitations, asymmetry, lack of knowledge, and just staying connected. We want to know are there successful practices out there already, and how can we build on and extend those?”  Miller’s forte is sociotechnical systems, i.e,, the systemic study of people and computing, where individuals or groups in various roles exchange info, learn, and apply care via technology. He says, “Tech facilitates that interaction. Right now (in hospitals) parents provide information primarily through conversation, white boards, and notebooks, and the electronic medical record has been only a partial solution because access alone is not enough. Also, parents as part of the ‘team’ is a new concept and there is still wariness. Pediatrics has been accepting longer with parents as advocates,” Miller adds.  Miller’s work also has implications for dyadic, or paired, caregiving in diverse healthcare contexts.​ The long-term goal of this project is to establish fundamental design strategies for social computing that enable effective dyadic caregiving coordination in unanticipated, stressful situations, such as the hospitalization of one’s child, and to show how those technologies could support decision-making and information sharing amid high degrees of uncertainty.   ### Acknowledgment  This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1850273.

    "body": "  ## New one- and two-year graduate programs address critical need for health IT professionals  July 1, 2010  Investments in the future of health care delivery include more than training additional doctors and nurses. Health information technology (health IT) specialists are critical.  While a growing number of hospitals and physicians want to offer their patients the benefits of electronic medical records and health information exchange, there is a nationwide shortage of highly skilled health IT workers to fill an estimated 60,000 positions.  In collaboration with the Regenstrief Institute, an internationally respected biomedical and public health informatics innovator dedicated to improving health by enhancing the quality of health care, the Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI will address the growing workforce needs for qualified health IT workers by creating an array of specialized one- and two-year graduate programs offering a combination of classroom instruction, distance accessible learning opportunities and on the job training.  These new programs are supported by a competitively awarded training grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC). This $1.4 million in Recovery Act funding is part of a $118 million investment by ONC in rapidly and sustainably increasing the availability of skilled health IT professionals needed to support the widespread adoption and meaningful use of health IT.  “We hope that people with computer backgrounds will want to explore the health world. We anticipate that physicians and others from the medical environment will be eager to learn how to utilize information technology to make patient care better and more efficient. With the support of ONC we are able to offer a variety of coursework options, provide stipends and also to arrange practicums at leading regional health institutions including several large hospital systems. Those who complete either the one or two year programs will be extremely well qualified to work in health IT,” said John T. Finnell, M.D., M.Sc., the Regenstrief Institute investigator and IU School of Medicine associate professor of emergency medicine who directs the IU-Regenstrief initiative.  The IU-Regenstrief programs will produce trained professionals for vital, highly specialized health IT roles. Trainees may include physicians, nurses and other health-care providers, as well as IT and computer science professionals. Most trainees will complete intensive courses of study in a year or less, while others will study toward a master’s degree in health IT. Tuition support is available for the most qualified applicants.  Additional information on the programs to be offered this fall can be found at www.in-info-web2.https://luddy.iupui.edu/HITtraining.

    "body": "  ## ADS alum Nikhil Morar turns data into revenue generation for LA Lakers  November 9, 2022  After earning his undergraduate degree in Business Analytics, Nikhil  Morar knew he wanted to work in sports. He chose Indianapolis and IUPUI because of the M.S. in Applied Data Science with a specialization in Sports Analytics program, and the professional sports teams, state of the art facilities, and sports business headquarters located in the city. The degree program at IUPUI is jointly taught by the School of Informatics and Computing and the School of Health and Human Sciences.  [M.S. in Applied Data Science with a specialization in Sports Analytics](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/data-science/sports-analytics-masters/)  “Sports organizations need analytics experts who can turn data about their customers and teams into revenue-generating strategies. The program helped me learn core competencies in data analysis, data management and infrastructure, client–server application development, and ethical and professional management of sports informatics projects,” Morar said.  After serving as a Business Intelligence intern with Nashville SC, in his hometown Nashville, TN, during the Covid-19 pandemic and as a Senior Data Analyst for two seasons at Chicago Fire FC,  Morar is now Manager of Business Analytics & Strategy for the Los Angeles Lakers basketball franchise.  In his role with the Lakers organization, Morar develops data integrations, quantitative analyses, performance metrics, and dashboard visualizations to drive key strategic and revenue generating business initiatives, providing data, and reporting to inform decision-making on a variety of business areas including ticketing, partnerships, broadcast, and ad-hoc research.  He also performs advanced modeling on large data sets; interprets and provides key takeaways in support of ticket supply, demand, and pricing analytics; and analyzes primary and secondary ticketing data to provide actionable insights. He partners with the ticketing team to develop touchpoint and outreach strategy to ensure season ticket member satisfaction during the NBA season.   ### Experiential learning began in grad school  “Nikhil was one of the early leaders in the sports analytics program. He was very proactive getting involved with various research projects in the Sports Innovation Institute. He was instrumental in the fan persona development project we did with the Indy Eleven in the applied research methods course I taught. His fast rise in the profession is no surprise to those of us who worked with him during his time at IUPUI,” said David Pierce, associate professor of sports management and director of the Sports Innovation Institute at IUPUI.  [Sports Innovation Institute](https://sii.iupui.edu/)  While in graduate school, Morar was also part of a team that won ESPN’s Hackathon at the 2020 MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference . Out of 143 applications (102 students and 41 professionals) from people around the world, Morar was one of 35 selected to participate.

[Imputing Shot Arcs for Enhanced Shot Evaluation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52hivyFDmhs)   ### Advice to others considering a sports analytics career  Morar pointed out that an internship is often a critical piece of breaking into the sports industry because it allows students to get experience without the employer having to invest in them. They will often be able to get an internship through the help of their college’s career services office, enabling them to build credibility and bolster their resume for sports business/analytics entry-level jobs.  “I try to always put myself in the shoes of someone reading something for the first time, to explain complicated concepts instead of assuming people get them, and to really work on trying to bring examples and analogies. I’m far from perfect but I think by at least aiming to think like someone who is new to a subject, it really helps figure out how to clarify sports analytics,” Morar said. “Many people pick a job based on the city, team/organization, or job title and compensation package. However, the most important thing is to find an opportunity to work with leaders that will challenge you every day, let you learn by making mistakes, and most importantly invest in your individual growth.”     ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Luddy Indianapolis professors, students join leading HCI practitioners at CHI 2023  July 5, 2023  Luddy Indianapolis was well-represented at the world’s leading human-computer interaction academic conference this spring, with a faculty member presenting a daylong symposium, and one paper receiving an honorable mention.  CHI 2023 – the ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems – was held April 23-28 in Hamburg, Germany. Participants from IU’s Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering in Indianapolis who attended in-person included students Adina Friedman, Yukta Karkera, and Hawra Rabaan, who presented papers, and Andrew D. Miller (left), Ph.D., incoming department chair of the School’s Human-Centered Computing Department.  [CHI 2023](https://chi2023.acm.org/)  [Andrew D. Miller](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/andrew-miller/)  CHI is considered the most prestigious series of academic conferences in the human-computer interaction (HCI) field.   ### Symposium  Miller, an associate professor, co-organized a daylong mini conference, “Workgroup on Interactive Systems in Healthcare” ( WISH ), at CHI 2023.  [WISH](https://doi.org/10.1145/3544549.3573804)  “The WISH symposium is the premier international meeting place for researchers in human-centered design,” Miller says, “and has been running at major conferences in HCI and health informatics for over a decade.”  “This year’s symposium was the first in-person WISH since 2019, and was attended by over 100 attendees from HCI, medicine, and industry.”  Miller co-organized the symposium with colleagues Daniel A. Epstein from the University of California and Aisling Ann O’Kane from the University of Bristol (U.K.)  During WISH there were more than 70 accepted presentations, “some presented orally and the rest in two very robust poster sessions,” Miller says. There also were three interactive panels.  “Many attendees said the WISH symposium was the highlight of the conference for them,” he added.   ### Accepted papers  More than 4,500 researchers and practitioners from almost 80 countries attended CHI 2023. Out of over 3,100 papers submitted, just under 900 were accepted for publication and presentation at the conference. Luddy Indianapolis students and faculty presented four accepted papers at the conference, including one which was awarded an honorable mention.   ### Honorable mention  A paper co-authored by Ratanond Koonchanok , a research and teaching assistant who is earning his doctorate in data science at Luddy Indianapolis, earned an honorable mention (top 5% of papers) at the academic conference. Co-author Khairi Reda, Ph.D., an associate professor of data science and human-computer interaction at Luddy Indianapolis, did a virtual presentation of the paper, “Visual Belief Elicitation Reduces the Incidence of False Discovery.” Other co-authors include Gauri Yatindra Tawde, Gokul Ragunandhan Narayanasamy, and Shalmali Walimbe.

[Watch CPT Info Session Recording](https://iu.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/t/1_5z6dtzxw)   ### Eligibility  For an F-1 student to be eligible to do an internship, you must be eligible for Curricular Practical Training (CPT). CPT is a type of work authorization granted by the Office of International Affairs (OIA) at IUPUI; there is no additional fee to apply for CPT. You must meet the following qualifications:   #### Qualification 1: Make Sure You Qualify  To be eligible for CPT, you must be in F-1 status and have been a full-time student for at least one full academic year (one fall and one spring semester). You can begin CPT after you have met the one academic year requirement. Talk to an International Student Advisor if you have questions regarding this requirement.   #### Qualification 2: Enroll in a CPT Eligible Course  You must register in an appropriate course during the semester in which your internship will take place as part of the CPT process. This course must count towards degree requirements for your major field of study and work authorization must be necessary to complete course objectives. You must be registered for an appropriate course before you can complete a CPT request.  CPT eligible course options will be in one of three categories:  Graduate students only: The work benefits your thesis/dissertation/final project in a material and substantial way. Registration for thesis/dissertation/final project credit(s) is required.   #### Qualification 3: Have an Offer of Employment  You must submit an offer letter on company letterhead from your prospective employer. The letter must include:   ### Applying for Internship + CPT Work Authorization  There are several steps you need to take before you can begin your internship. You should begin this process a minimum of two weeks before your internship begins . We cannot guarantee you will be able to begin on your desired start date if you submit your application late.   #### Step 1: Receive Offer of Employment  Make sure your offer letter includes the following:   #### Step 2: Determine Your Internship Course to Enroll in  Make sure to talk to your Academic Advisor or Program Director about what course you should use for CPT. Some common course numbers include INFO-I 391, INFO-I 584, INFO-I 595, etc. Because most of these courses are variable credits, make sure you enroll in the correct number of credits.  INFO-I 595 Students: You cannot enroll in this course until you have reported your internship to the Luddy Indianapolis Career team.  INFO-B 584 Students: Please reach out to Dr. Gary Schwebach at gschweba@iu.edu before completing this application above. Many internships are used for INFO-B 584 practicum which is not managed by Career Services.  Health Info Mgmt Majors: HIM-M 443 and HIM-M 444 are not managed by Career Services. If you are looking to register for these courses do not fill out this application and instead email Nicole Van Andel for your next steps at nvanande@iupui.edu .   #### Step 3: Register Your Internship  You need to register your internship if you are enrolling in any of the following courses:  [register your internship](https://iupuisoic-fireform.eas.iu.edu/online/pageforms/index/89b57030-01dc-40f4-c4b2-08dac108dba4)  When you register your internship, you will need to be able to provide the following details:  [Register Internship](https://iupuisoic-fireform.eas.iu.edu/online/pageforms/index/89b57030-01dc-40f4-c4b2-08dac108dba4)   #### Step 4: Enroll in a CPT Eligible Course  Once you have received permission to enroll in your CPT Eligible course, make sure to enroll in your course as soon as possible. Enrolling as early as possible is always the best option!  In the internship course, you are expected to complete weekly journals along with additional assignments. Failure to submit work on time will result in being withdrawn from the course which may result in you losing your F-1 status and having to exit the United States.   #### Step 5: Apply for Curricular Practical Training  You can apply for CPT with the Office of International Affairs (OIA) in Atlas . For the 2 nd Approver, please list your Luddy academic advisor .  [Atlas](https://international.iupui.edu/atlas/index.html)  OIA can take up to 10 business days to process your request so applying as soon as possible is always the best option. If you have problems with the Atlas form, contact iadvisor@iupui.edu for assistance.   ### Frequently Asked Questions   #### How early can I start my internship?  When does the end date need to be?  The earliest your internship can start is the day after the previous term/semester ends and it can go until the last day of final exams in the semester your CPT course is.  For students on an F-1 visa, there are no exceptions to extend the course with an incomplete.  If your internship is extended or will last over one semester, you must enroll in a new course for the following semester to continue your internship.   #### My internship was extended! What do I do?  Congratulations! If your internship extends past the last day of final exams in a semester, you will need to enroll in another CPT eligible course in the next available semester/term and reapply with Career Services and the OIA.  You must have remaining elective credit to enroll.  Plan accordingly with your academic advisor.   #### My internship was extended! What do I do?  No. As an F-1 student, you are only qualified to do CPT if you have course credits that count towards your degree program. If you have no more eligible credits, you are not eligible for CPT. Contact OIA to find out what other work authorization options there are for you.   #### If I have an unpaid internship, do I still need CPT?  The Office of International Affairs (OIA) highly recommends that you apply for CPT, even for an unpaid work experience. You must be careful not to “volunteer” without pay in positions that U.S. citizens would be paid for. This rule is designed to protect you, the employer, and other workers.

    "body": "  ## phpMyAdmin  For phpMyAdmin, use a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, Chromium, etc.) to connect to a URL starting with https:// followed by the name of the server, then /phpmyadmin/  For example: https://in-info-web4.informatics.iupui.edu/phpmyadmin/ or https://deeplearn.luddy.iupui.edu/phpmyadmin/  [https://in-info-web4.informatics.iupui.edu/phpmyadmin/](https://in-info-web4.informatics.iupui.edu/phpmyadmin/)  [https://deeplearn.luddy.iupui.edu/phpmyadmin/](https://deeplearn.luddy.iupui.edu/phpmyadmin/)  Log in using CAS  On first connecting to phpmyadmin, your browser will redirect to one of IU’s single sign-on systems (CAS or IU Login). Here, you will enter your standard IU credentials.  You will now be connecting to the MySQL database via phpMyAdmin. The MySQL database uses different credentials because they must sometimes be stored in files readable by other users on the system (php or python files). Each user has credentials created for them via a script which randomly chooses their passphrase.  To access the password file, the student must first connect to the server via SFTP or SSH. Using a graphical SFTP program like WinSCP or Cyberduck is recommended, as it is the most intuitive; you connect to the remote computer (e.g. in-info-web4.informatics.iupui.edu) , navigate through the remote filesystem to your home directory (which is usually the default location that opens), then open the mysql credentials file. The passphrase found within can be used to log in via the phpMyAdmin page.   ### Connecting via SSH (command line) or SFTP (file transfer):  Before connecting via SSH/SFTP, you will first need to have a campus IP address by either being physically on campus (using campus wireless or wired connection) or using the VPN if you’re off campus or using a non-IU Internet connection while on campus. Once you have installed and activated the VPN software, your computer will be seen as part of the campus network.  [VPN](https://kb.iu.edu/d/ajrq)   #### SSH/SFTP Software  Command line versions of ssh and sftp are installed by default on Windows 10, Linux, and MacOSX.  Graphical versions are also available via IUware.  Windows:  [PuTTY](https://iuware.iu.edu/Windows/title/781)  [WinSCP](https://iuware.iu.edu/Windows/title/785)  OSX:  [Cyberduck](https://iuware.iu.edu/Mac/Title/857)   #### Connect using graphical SSH/SFTP  If you are using FileZilla, make sure that your protocol is SFTP by prepending sftp:// to the host name. This is critical as FileZilla will normally default to the unencrypted FTP protocol which will send your username and passphrase over the Internet in clear text. There are several other graphical file transfer programs which allow multiple protocols. We highly suggest using an SFTP exclusive program.   ### Command line SSH/SFTP  If you don’t have the option to download and install a graphical SFTP program, then you’ll need to use SSH or SFTP via the command line. At this point, SSH is actually the more straightforward to use.  First you will need to open a command prompt or terminal session on your local computer:  Windows 10:  [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/windows-powershell/starting-windows-powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/windows-powershell/starting-windows-powershell)  OSX:  [https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/open-or-quit-terminal-apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/open-or-quit-terminal-apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac)  Linux: Due to the ubiquity of user interfaces, the most likely way to get a command prompt is to use a virtual terminal from ctl-alt-F4 or similar. To return to your graphical display, it’s usually ctl-alt-F7 or occasionally ctl-alt-F1. If neither of these work, cycle through all the ctl-alt-F# keys. One of them is bound to have your X session.  Next, you will type the following at this command prompt:  ssh yourusername@theServerToWhichYouAreConnecting ( e.g. ssh jawzjaguar@in-info-web4.informatics.iupui.edu )  You will see a response similar or identical to:  The authenticity of host ‘in-info-web4.informatics.iupui.edu (134.68.246.118)’ can’t be established. ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:i+GIv+KvV1xr56iWkAmONNT5L7ybmZzzfTP4BauWdUo. Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?  Type “yes” to continue, then it will ask for your IU passphrase.  Once entered, you will have a command prompt on the server which will look like this: jawzjaguar@in-info-web4:~$  From here you can type cat /home/students/jawzjaguar/jawzjaguar-mysql-password like so: jawzjaguar@in-info-web4:~$ cat /home/students/jawzjaguar/jawzjaguar-mysql-password DB username: jawzjaguar DB databasename: jawzjaguar_db DB password: [PASSPHRASE REDACTED] "

    "body": "  ## LIS-S 640 Seminar in Intellectual Freedom  3 credits  [schedule](https://sisjee.iu.edu/sisigps-prd/web/igps/course/search/)   ### Description  Intellectual freedom concerns information philosophy, ethics, and discussion of timely sociotechnical issues associated with freedom. Your primary concern is the ability of humans to participate in intellectual activities to seek and use information. From some angles, your concern will be information seeking and use without intrusion and influence. From other angles, you will examine justifiable reasons where such actions should be limited. While not always the case, intellectual freedom naturally concerns end products from intellectual activities, such as speech acts (e.g., literal speech, writing, art, other creative endeavors). You will as a result examine social, technological, and political structures that interact with one’s intellectual freedom. Topics addressed will reflect timely issues and, therefore, change from semester to semester. Topics may not center directly on issues of librarianship, but students have significant flexibility to address intellectual freedom concerns that are of professional interest to them.   ### Program Learning Goals Supported  Instructors map their courses to specific LIS Program Goals .

    "body": "  ## The School of Informatics and Computing Announces I-Learning Environment in Development for 2014-15 School Year  March 4, 2014  Informatics professor and program director, Sara Hook and lecturer Jennifer Stewart, recently secured a Learning Environment grant from the IUPUI Center for Teaching & Learning for the creation of an I-Learn center in the School of Informatics and Computing.  I-Learn which stands for Informatics-Learn, Engage, Apply, Reflect, Network- will be a collaborative area providing students with a new venue for learning, and a place to engage with faculty members and community partners.  The center will be located on the fifth floor of the Informatics and Communications Technology Complex, and will also function as a place for students to apply newly acquired skills and knowledge as they move through the undergraduate Informatics program. This newly proposed facility will offer the opportunity for students to reflect on what they have learned and network with one another.  The proposed area would come equipped with a more flexible workspace where tables and chairs are on wheels, and can be easily moved around, along with various display units. The space would also make available desktop computers, and a video wall display, as well as other resource materials.  An I-Learn center is crucial to further training and the educational experience of students because of the opportunity for increased engagement between them and faculty.  It will also aid in helping to foster and develop a sense of reciprocity and cooperation among students.  It will encourage active learning and provide an avenue for prompt feedback and space where diverse talents and ways of learning are respected and accommodated.  Although primarily targeted to undergraduate Informatics students, the I-Learn space would also be available for other students in the department.  This openness and ease of accessibility to a variety of students will then create a unique opportunity and help to cultivate an atmosphere in which undergraduate and graduate students will feel free to interact, network, and mentor one another.  Currently, the new I-Learn area is scheduled to be open and operational by August 2014.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## A $428,244 NIH grant will enable Yan to explore genetic basis of Alzheimer’s  November 14, 2019  Much of how our brains get built is inherited. And parts of this neural network are affected by Alzheimer’s disease.  Jingwen Yan (pictured above), an assistant professor of bioinformatics at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, has received a $428,244 National Institutes of Health R21 grant to explore the genetic basis of Alzheimer’s-altered brain connectivity from a novel perspective by studying the genetic coordination underlying brain connectivity.  [Jingwen Yan](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/jingwen-yan/)  “We expect this work to pave the way for unprecedented discovery related to understanding disease mechanisms and the development of therapeutic strategies and diagnostic markers,” she says.  Yan’s grant is titled “Gene Co-Expression Underlying the Connectomic Alterations in Alzheimer’s Disease”  Researchers know there is a close relationship between gene co-expression and the brain’s structural and functional networks, but it isn’t yet clear what genes are responsible.  “Identification of these genes will transform our understanding of the biological underpinnings of altered neural system in Alzheimer’s disease,” says Yan, “and can exert a huge impact on the development of new diagnostic, therapeutic and preventative approaches for Alzheimer’s.”  Pinpointing these genes has been difficult, because neural network data is so complex.  Using her NIH exploratory/developmental research grant, Yan is developing novel integrative approaches, and is eager to identify:  “Identification of these genes…can exert a huge impact on the development of new diagnostic, therapeutic and preventative approaches for Alzheimer’s.” Jingwen Yan  “By leveraging the brain-wide transcriptome data, we will learn a set of genes whose co-expression patterns across the  brain regions of interest can best explain their altered connections in Alzheimer’s,” Yan says.  “If successful, results from this project will transform our understanding of the interplay between genes and brain regions in Alzheimer’s disease, and thus be expected to impact biomedical research in general and benefit public health outcomes.”   ### Acknowledgment  An NIH R21 Exploratory/Developmental Grant is intended to encourage exploratory/developmental research by providing support for the early and conceptual stages of project development. The NIH has standardized the Exploratory/Developmental Grant (R21) application characteristics, requirements, preparation, and review procedures in order to accommodate investigator-initiated (unsolicited) grant applications. These grants fund exploratory, novel studies that break new ground or extend previous discoveries toward new directions or applications.  [NIH R21 Exploratory/Developmental Grant](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/r21.htm)  The research is supported by the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number 1R21AG066135-01 .

    "body": "  ## Classroom & Lab Policies   ### Availability  Students not enrolled in the class must vacate the classroom before class begins.   ### Quiet  Luddy Indianapolis computer classrooms are quiet zones. Students are expected to use low voices when talking and headphones when listening to music or audible computer sounds. Instructor workstations may only be used during classroom time, or if approved by Luddy Indianapolis faculty or staff.   ### Food & drink  No food or drink is allowed in Luddy Indianapolis classrooms.   ### Lost & Found  Found items are available from the technology staff in IT 259.   ## Academic Use  Luddy Indianapolis computer classrooms are for academic use only.  Students using computers for academic work will be given preference to those who are not. This includes students waiting to use equipment; those not involved in academic work may be asked to give up their workstation.  Anyone disturbing the academic environment will be asked to leave.   ## Access  All Luddy Indianapolis students will have access to designated computer classrooms during open hours on a first come, first served basis. The designated rooms will be available while the building is open. When the building is closed some students may be granted access via their CrimsonCard.  Interested students must fill out a Facility Access Request Form .  The student’s CrimsonCard must be scanned to enable access.  A card scanner is available in IT 259 when the room is open for equipment check-out.  There is a special kiosk on the fourth-floor of the IT building at the reception desk that has a self-service card scanner.  Some special use rooms have on-line electronic locks that require the student’s 10-digit student ID to be submitted to Campus Police so the lock(s) can be programmed.  Each person entering the room must swipe their Crimson Card , even if the door is opened from the inside, or if several people are entering at one time.  The university and the school take the security of people and equipment very seriously.   Propping doors open and allowing unauthorized persons to enter the building and classrooms compromises that security.  At the end of the semester, all card access is revoked. Students must re-apply for the next semester.   ### Persons not affiliated with IUPUI  Access to Luddy Indianapolis technology resources is a privilege granted to Luddy Indianapolis faculty, staff, and students. Access may also be granted to individuals outside of the school, for purposes consistent with the school’s mission. However, sponsorship of these accounts by a faculty member (or department administrator) is required.  [sponsorship of these accounts](http://kb.iupui.edu/data/akll.html)   ### File Storage  No file storage is a substitute for a good backup routine. All users should back up files while working, preferably to removable media such as Box or USB flash drive.  The C: drive of every Windows computer and the Macintosh HD of every iMac computer will be cleared of user data periodically throughout the semester. All personal files on those drives (including profiles and files on the desktop) will be deleted in the process.   ### Software  Computers in Luddy Indianapolis classrooms are maintained by Luddy Indianapolis technology staff. Luddy Indianapolis uses the latest stable version of the Windows and Mac OSX operating systems.   Updates and patches are applied as recommended by the OS vendors and IU’s Security Office.  Operating systems and software used in support of the school’s teaching mission are updated during the summer.  The school rarely does mid-school-year upgrades unless there are problems with versions already installed.  Students may not install software or utilities on any computer in Luddy Indianapolis classrooms, unless directed by faculty or staff. Please submit a service request if software is missing (or needed).  [submit a service request](https://iupuisoic-fireform.eas.iu.edu/online/pageforms/index/dc3fdc7a-91bb-43a5-1f0d-08d9f5af18a2)  Violation of this policy will be considered malicious intent (see below).   ### Malicious intent  Anyone found intentionally and/or maliciously destroying system files on any Luddy Indianapolis computers will be disciplined, including loss of computing privileges and possible academic action.   ### Printing  IUPUI has a campus-wide pay-for-print policy. The Luddy Indianapolis is covered by this policy. More information about this policy is available in the Knowledge Base. The KB also has more information about the CrimsonCard that you should read as well.  [More information about this policy](https://kb.iu.edu/d/aouh)  [CrimsonCard](https://kb.iu.edu/d/aobi)   ### Special paper  Special paper may not be used in printers without assistance of technology staff. Transparencies may not be printed under any circumstances.   ### Schedule Posting  Luddy Indianapolis classroom schedules are maintained in 25 Live Pro . If, for any reason, a room must be closed during a normally open time, a note will be posted on the door.  [25 Live Pro](https://one.iu.edu/task/iu/25livepro) "

    "body": "  ## Moore scholar takes her information science journey into digital territory  October 5, 2022  Amira Malcom, this year’s recipient of the Wilma Gibbs Moore Graduate Endowed Scholarship, is forging her own path in an evolving digital landscape: social media trends.  As she earns her MLIS through the Department of Library and Information Science , she says, “My academic interests lie mostly in meme culture and digital phenomena surrounding youth linguistics and cultural appropriation.  [Department of Library and Information Science](https://luddy.iupui.edu/lis/)  “This is a long way of saying that I hoped to use the tools of this program to become a meme librarian.”   ### Creating pathways to democratize  Malcom has been associated with the School of Informatics and Computing (SoIC), at IU’s Indianapolis campus, for several years.  [School of Informatics and Computing](https://luddy.iupui.edu)  “After graduating from the Media Arts and Science program in 2018, Zeb Wood reached out to me about joining a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion-based working group at the school,” she says. “I was more than happy to accept, as he and I had had many conversations around those topics.”  [Zeb Wood](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/zeb-wood/)  Andrea Copeland , Ph.D. and chair of the Department of Library and Information Science, recalls, “I got to know Amira through the working group and immediately was impressed by her brilliance.  [Andrea Copeland](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/andrea-copeland/)  “Then, spent the last two years recruiting her to the MLIS program. Selfishly, I always want to the best and the brightest for the information professions.”  [MLIS](https://luddy.iupui.edu/lis/master-library-science/)  While serving as alumni chair of the working group at SoIC, Malcom refined her focus on meme culture to include the philanthropic nature of Black contributions to social media.  “I started to see the connection,” Malcom says, “where I could use information science to start the work of creating pathways back to Black creators and continue to democratize the influencer landscape at large.”   ### Linked by a passion for preserving culture  Her scholarship’s namesake, Wilma Gibbs Moore, had a similar passion – not in the realm of social media or memes, but to preserve the history of Black culture in Indiana. Moore worked for 30 years for the Indiana Historical Society as senior archivist of African-American History. She died in 2018.  “It means so much to me to have this award,” Malcom says. “From what I have heard about Ms. Wilma from her friends and colleagues it is clear that she was a driven and involved library professional.”  In 2013, Moore told The Indianapolis Recorder, “Your history is who you are, and when you get to a point where you somehow discount it or not think it’s important, you really diminish yourself.”  Today, Malcom says, “I hope that my focus on African-American contributions to internet culture is able to provide a fresh perspective on her goal to preserve African-American history.”   ### Back to school  In addition to her degree from SoIC, Malcom also earned a B.A. in photography from the Herron School of Art and Design at Indiana University’s Indianapolis campus.  She’s worked for the Indianapolis Museum of Art at Newfields, Big Car, and the Harrison Center. She lists contributing to the inception of the Greatriarchs series at the Harrison Center, and bringing to life Phase II of the Center for Black Literature & Culture at Central Library, among her career highlights.  [Greatriarchs](https://www.harrisoncenter.org/greatriarchs)  [the Center for Black Literature & Culture](https://www.indypl.org/locations/central-library/center-for-black-literature-and-culture)  Pursuing a graduate degree at SoIC is allowing Malcom to delve into the digital realm in new ways, focusing on the cultural significance of memes and other virtual media.  “I found that the MLIS program could give me the tools to study that on a deeper level and create discourse around social media trends,” she says.  In her graduate studies at the IU School of Informatics and Computing, Malcom says she hopes to study of the impact of screen cultures and the effects of social media on society. She notes on her website that in her writing, she “aims to access a still-understudied part of the human experience that addresses memory, culture, and social connections within racialized spaces.”  [her website](https://www.amiramal.com/)   ### Why memes?  “I don’t know that there is a specific meme that made me want to pursue librarianship in that sphere,” Malcom says. But after learning about mem librarian and trend expert Amanda Brennan, “I found a genuine role model that crossed the fields I was interested in.”  “I’m used to having to split interests,” Malcom adds, “between media arts and photography, and now philanthropy and library information science.  I was excited to have a path forward in a field that I felt reflected all my interests in a way I felt excited to engage in.”   ### Wise dog and ramen  From Grumpy Cat to Mocking SpongeBob, Wordle, or anything Drake, everyone has a favorite meme. Malcom is no exception.  “I’m a big fan of the Dog of Wisdom,” she says. “I have a tattoo of the dachshund in the little plane, actually!  “My birthday is in May, so I also enjoy the Justin Timberlake ramen meme that comes around the end of April every year.  “I like exploring millennial/Gen-Z nihilism and other evolving forms of humor,” Malcom adds, “which is why I feel it’s important to explore that growth of context from an academic perspective.”   ### About Wilma Gibbs Moore  The Wilma Gibbs Moore Graduate Endowed Scholarship memorializes Moore and her many contributions to the historical record of African Americans in Indiana.  [Wilma Gibbs Moore Graduate Endowed Scholarship](https://luddy.iupui.edu/alumni-partners/moore-scholarship/)  Wilma Gibbs Moore graduated from Crispus Attucks High School and received her B.S. in sociology and her master’s in library science degree from Indiana University.  She worked at Indiana University Libraries, the Indianapolis Public Library, and the Indiana History Center.  Copeland adds, “Mrs. Moore dedicated her life to building a more inclusive history and we would like to keep her legacy alive by building a more inclusive profession in her honor.” An associate professor with SoIC’s Department of Library and Information Science, Copeland collaborated with Moore on archiving projects.     ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

His work recently has included collaborating on COVID-19 research to develop new diagnostic tests for rapid detection of the viral strain.  [COVID-19 research to develop new diagnostic tests](https://luddy.iupui.edu/news/story/janga-covid-19-diagnostic)  Janga also has been examining the fields of epitranscriptomics, exploring RNA modifications: the factors that ultimately control the fate of protein production as DNA is transcribed to RNA and then translated to proteins, and how genes are regulated in a cell at post-transcriptional level by RNA-binding proteins as well as long non-coding RNAs.  More broadly, the Janga Lab of Genomics and Systems Biology is developing computational approaches to mine complex and heterogeneous data sources, which are publicly available in biomedical sciences.   #### From data to diagnosis  Exploring the possibilities of artificial intelligence and machine learning, the lab examines the phenotypic landscape of an organism and its relevance to disease conditions. To achieve this goal, researchers exploit diverse sources of data that stem from a burgeoning number of high-throughput technologies, to turn this information into valuable knowledge.  Janga and the lab’s researchers also generate experimental data in genomic sciences, and develop new types of data analysis methods—as well as algorithms—to extract, mine, and analyze such complex data sets to facilitate novel technology development for stratification and diagnosis in cancer and neurological diseases.  Early in his career, Janga helped to shape an understanding of the structure and dynamics of bacterial gene regulatory networks, working in Mexico with the group of Dr. Julio Collado-Vides at the Laboratory of Computational Genomics in Center for Genomic Sciences at UNAM in Cuernavaca. This was followed by doctoral work in England on exploiting network-based approaches in studying cellular networks at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Darwin College, University of Cambridge, with Drs. Madan Babu and Sarah Teichmann.  Janga was an Institute for Genomic Biology Fellow at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign, working on applying computational and systems approaches to mine metagenomic samples for identifying novel antibacterial pathways and compounds during his post-doctoral period (2010-2012).   ### Research Interests  Professor Janga’s research integrates computational and experimental multi-omic approaches to study complex and heterogeneous data sources in biomedical sciences, with the goal of understanding how the regulation, structure and dynamics of biological systems shape the phenotypic landscape of an organism and its relevance to disease conditions. His interdisciplinary research team in collaboration with clinical and translational scientists, examines these questions using cutting edge next generation sequencing technologies and data science frameworks to develop novel bioinformatics algorithms to understand how RNA interactions, structures and their cross talk with various cellular entities in cell lines and animal models can be employed for dissecting complex phenotypes in liver, brain, kidney and immune diseases.   ### Classes  INFO B619 Structural Bioinformatics  [INFO B619](https://luddy.iupui.edu/courses/info-b619/)  INFO B656 Translational Bioinformatics Applications  [INFO B656](https://luddy.iupui.edu/courses/info-b656/)   ### Related News "

Finnell, director and associate professor of health informatics, was quoted in the March 26 issue of USA Today for an article entitled, “Obama’s health law has accelerated marketplace change.”  Finnell was interviewed about local- and state-run health information exchanges to share patients’ medical information among different systems. Several hospitals in Indianapolis started their own exchange a decade ago, the article states. It continues, “…Today, the exchange has expanded well beyond that goal and the city’s limits to include data on 10 million patients shared with 80 hospitals and 19,000 doctors. The exchange enables health care providers to instantly access a patient’s medical history whether they are in emergency rooms or at their family doctor.  ‘It helps speed the care, and we can provide better care,’ said J.T. Finnell, an emergency room physician at Wishard Health Services, the public health system in Indianapolis. He said the information also reduces unnecessary tests and makes sure patients get the right medications.”  Finnell is also associate professor of emergency medicine for the IU School of Medicine and research scientist for Regenstrief Institute.

    "body": "  ## Third successful year culminates in expansion of iDEW program  July 9, 2018  The Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce (iDEW) program recently wrapped up its third year with semester-end presentations at three Indianapolis area high schools. Students at Pike, Arsenal Technical, and Providence Cristo Rey high schools showcased their robotics projects to enthusiastic audiences of parents, administrators, industry professionals, IUPUI faculty and staff, and fellow students.      The student-designed robots included machines that performed tasks like filling potholes and assisting in fire rescue, and devices that collected and disposed of hair clippings in a salon. In previous semesters, iDEW student projects focused on video game design, Internet of Things (IoT), trivia apps, data visualization, and chatbots.  The iDEW initiative was conceived as an IT talent pipeline targeted to underrepresented youth and was designed to teach critical skills through project-based learning. The comprehensive program is the result of a partnership between academia and Indiana corporations and organizations and is led by teachers at the high schools, with training and support provided by IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI faculty, staff, and near-peer mentors.  Students participate through their senior year, can earn dual credit through Indiana University and professional IT certifications as they advance, and are prepared for the IT workforce as well as for enrollment in two-year and four-year college degree programs.  Over 400 students have completed courses in the unique iDEW program so far—expanding from 70 freshmen in three classes in its pilot year to fourteen classes in fall 2017—representing 540 percent growth and a student retention rate of 81 percent. Twenty-two students graduated in spring 2017, all of whom attended college that fall; 18 majored in STEM disciplines. This year, 61 seniors graduated from iDEW; 54 of them are currently enrolled in college classes, four are in the military, one is working on technical certifications, and the other two are taking a gap year.  The iDEW program was recognized by US2020 with a 2017 STEM Mentoring Award for Excellence in Public-Private Partnerships, and this year received a Techpoint Mira Award for Tech Educator of the Year.  This upcoming school year, iDEW leadership is expanding the program to five new schools to reach more underserved students. IU School of Informatics and Computing Senior Executive Associate Dean Mathew J. Palakal, program director of iDEW, says, “Our industry partners offer counsel on current technology and workforce needs, and community donors provide much needed financial support. Together, we have transformed the lives of hundreds of bright young students. We look forward to bringing the iDEW program to even more of our youth.”  Those interested in exploring opportunities for financial investment or employee involvement in iDEW are asked to contact IU School of Informatics and Computing Director of Development Stacy Zearing, iDEW Program Manager Vicki Daugherty, or iDEW Program Director Mathew J. Palakal for more information.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Informatics grad finds path to success in IT at Salesforce, Indianapolis  July 1, 2021  Bunmi Akintomide (BS, Informatics, 2013; MS, Human-Centered Computing, 2015) is a Systems Specialist Manager at Salesforce, where he manages the marketing team within their Business Technology space. During his time at SoIC, he served as a student mentor for the Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce (iDEW) program. Bunmi was kind enough to share his remembrances of his time in the School of Informatics and Computing and with iDEW, and his current work with Salesforce.  In Informatics, Bunmi discovered a field that merged his primary interests. “I love people and technology. Informatics was the field that was perfect for that combination. It allows me to use technology to solve problems that we face in our day to day lives,” Bunmi tells us. In Human-Computer Interaction, Bunmi’s future path in IT became clear. “Through HCI, you have the control of changing how people interact with technology, that’s my why, and the reason I chose that path.” Bunmi found an excellent fit for his interests at SoIC. “IUPUI was a perfect choice for me because the Informatics program is excellent and most importantly IUPUI is in Indianapolis, I wanted to be close to my family, and also be able to do internships to get work experience.”  Bunmi fondly recalls his time at SoIC, the instruction received, and the work he created. “I had an amazing time at SoIC, the professors were very helpful, and most importantly our career counselor (Brian Benedict) was very helpful. My most memorable work is my Capstone, where I created an app that uses AI to predict and help consumers select what clothing items to buy when they visit a store. Most people hate going into the store because they don’t know what to buy, and using the app I created, making a selection was easier. During the capstone, my professor at the time, Stephen Voida, was a key resource to the successful completion of the project.”  Another important part of Bunmi’s time at SoIC was his role as a student mentor for the iDEW program, which provides students at Indianapolis-area high schools with high minority and/or underrepresented populations with IT curriculum and presents a pathway to college and university programs and careers in the IT field. The opportunity to work with high school students was a primary motivator for Bunmi. “I enjoyed my time with the iDEW program, especially visiting the classrooms to talk to the kids about my journey and what my day to day looks like at work,” he remembers.  “Most of the students were not looking at technology as a field they wanted to pursue, but after my visit, I could see their eagerness to want to learn more about technology and potentially major in a technology field. I wanted to be part of this because I see how there’s a lack of diversity and representation of the underrepresented population in the IT fields, I believe it starts with the high school kids, getting them exposed to technology will play a big role in their desire in wanting to pursue a career in an IT field.”  Now a seven year veteran of the IT workforce himself, Bunmi works as Systems Specialist Manager at Salesforce here in Indianapolis. He tells us, “A typical day for me involves meeting with our product team, engineering team, and business partners to make sure my team is successfully delivering the work, and supporting innovation within our space. It’s an amazing environment to be in, and I truly enjoy what I’m doing, and happy to work at a company like Salesforce.” Bunmi sees unlimited potential in IT’s future, and the innovations coming out of IT are particularly important in the times we live in today. He points out, “As we can see right now, technology is the main reason we can all still work remotely during this pandemic. The future of technology is great, it’s exciting how the big tech companies are innovating every day… HCI / Informatics is very important to the future of technology, because if the consumer or the users can’t interact with the technology what’s the point of it? I’m looking forward to more AI innovation, how it can be used to make our lives easier.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

Her current emphasis centers on connecting the cultural outputs of individuals and community groups to a sustainable preservation infrastructure.  She is the co-editor of a recent volume, Participatory Heritage, which explores the many ways that people participate in cultural heritage activities outside of formal institutions. It also examines the possibility of making connections to those institutions to increase access and the chance of preservation for the tangible outputs that result from those activities. The Bethel Archive Project at IUPUI has greatly informed her knowledge in this area.  A new project, the IUPUI Human Library , continues to inform her work in participatory heritage.  “The Human Library is a place where real people and their stories are ‘on loan’ to readers,” Copeland says. “People go to libraries in search of new knowledge. Usually, the knowledge vessel is a book.

Topics include:  Information Structures for the Web  This course covers HTML5, CSS3, and responsive web design to meet the needs of any viewport. This course emphasizes the development of basic skills that will allow you to create webpages and to combine these pages into functional websites. After several weeks of working on your technical skills, you will be making valid, accessible, and usable websites that are viewable on all devices. This course requires that you develop a proficiency in both technical skills as well as conceptual skills. The future of information delivery is through a screen of some sort, whether it be a desktop monitor, a tablet, a smartphone, or any other device. You need to know how the users receive that information and what must be done to accommodate them. You may never enter a career where you actually create websites, but if you plan to be an information professional of any type you will certainly assist in developing, judging, acquiring, accepting, promoting, and rejecting information delivered by a web-enabled device of some sort. Learning and employing this technology will be situated in group work done collaboratively at a distance across time zones and cultures. Outcomes will include both technical skills along with the ability to establish shared goals with collaborators across cultures and produce an artifact that addresses an information need that this distance collaboration team has identified.

The eduStyle Guide to Usable Higher-Ed Homepage Design offers a glimpse into 20 of the best higher education websites in the U.S., and IUPUI is among them.  The book’s Introduction explains its criteria: “One of the first things you may notice about this book is that all of the sites we have included are great websites; in fact, these are the best of the best over the last few years.”  One of only three universities featured with more than 25,000 students, IUPUI received accolades for its inline video player with closed captioning, high quality photography, and task-based navigation.  “To be recognized as one of the best higher-ed sites in the country is truly a testament to the talents of our Web team,” said Troy D. Brown, Executive Director of the Office of Communications and Marketing. “We are setting the standard in higher education.” Brown holds a master’s degree in Media Arts and Science (MAS) from IUPUI.  The IUPUI site was produced and is maintained by the Electronic Communications Team in the Office of Communications and Marketing, IUPUI Office of External Affairs. Team members include Director Steve Hodges, BA’04; Chris Brown, BS’01, MS’04; Jolene Kernick, MS’04; Vanessa Richards, BA’94, MS’02; and Josh Normington, BS’06. Hodges, Brown, Kernick and Normington all have earned bachelor and/or master’s MAS degrees.  “This latest honor for the IUPUI Web site and its outstanding creative team is a real testament to the high quality of our Media Arts and Science Program,” said Tony Faiola, program director and interim executive associate dean. “We’re very proud of our grads and their continuing contributions to IUPUI’s success.”  The eduStyle recognition comes on the heels of several international awards for the IUPUI campus website, including top rankings in the 2007 and 2008 CASE Circle of Excellence Awards and back-to-back gold awards in the Admissions Advertising Awards those same years.

    "body": "  ## Luddy Lantinx student is a ‘life-changing influence’ for struggling high schoolers  June 21, 2023  Zaydee Dominguez-Chang knew personally the challenges high school students might have in the Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce (iDEW) program at Arsenal Technical High School in Indianapolis. Language barriers were not at the top of the list, but it soon became obvious that if they were to succeed in technology, they would need help from someone who understood them in more ways than one.  Dominguez-Chang was a graduate of the iDEW program herself, having participated in the program at Pike High School. “Having heard of iDEW from my older sister who participated in the program prior, I knew the basic premise,” she said. “Once I got to high school, I decided to take the iDEW classes just for the sake of trying something new. After that first year, I realized that programming and technology was something that I was good at; I enjoyed working on the semester projects, visiting the Luddy Indianapolis campus, gaining mentors that I can rely on, etcetera. From that point on, I made sure to join all iDEW classes offered at my high school and become an active participant in the program.”  Today, Dominguez-Chang is a rising junior at IU Luddy  School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering in Indianapolis with a double major in Informatics and Media Arts and Science, specializing in Web Development and Design, in preparation for a career as a Full-Stack Developer. She had learned about Luddy and IUPUI while still in high school and was attracted to both aspects of web development, the creative and the analytical. “Luddy was a school I had always known about. I knew since my first year in high school that it was one of my top choices; the environment has always been so welcoming, and the programs are one of a kind; I just knew I fit in.”  “Web development was something I enjoyed doing a lot. However, I am not the best designer by any means. Back-end programming attracted me, because I wanted to work in something analytical, but I knew that even though I did not know how to design very well, I was going to miss that part of development. When I found out that Luddy Indianapolis offered Full-Stack Development, I knew instantly that this program was perfect for me. Not only could I feed the analytical side of my brain, but I could also learn how to become a better designer and challenge myself overall,” she said.  In addition to being an iDEW mentor, Dominguez-Chang is also a Student Ambassador and mentor at Luddy Indianapolis. “We are incredibly lucky to have Zaydee as an ambassador, she is beyond excellent in everything she does. This is an amazing story—but yet not a surprising one given who Zaydee is!,” said Taylor Dooley, Director of Undergraduate Recruiting and Ambassador supervisor at Luddy.   ### Giving back and paying forward  Dominguez-Chang was happy to go back to Pike and work with her former Computer Science teacher, Justin Smith, who she considered her biggest role model and mentor back then. She said he introduced her to Informatics and helped her find her voice. Then she found an even bigger calling as an iDEW mentor herself at Arsenal.  iDEW program manager Vicki Daugherty described what happened next. “Our teacher partner at Arsenal Tech, Tinya Fisher, provided an update on the progress of one of her classes with nearly all Spanish speaking students. They were beyond struggling with the language barrier. This is a class that Zaydee now supports as a mentor on Tuesday and Friday mornings,” Daugherty said.  “Before Zaydee began working with this class, the majority of students were failing. With Zaydee’s bilingual support and all she brings to the class, everyone is now earning a grade of ‘C’ or better. Furthermore, Tinya is seeing full participation from the class and real enthusiasm from the students for their projects.”  As an iDEW mentor, Dominguez-Chang helps students with their semester-long projects. anything from idea creation to code debugging. She also helps translate deliverables to students as 95% of students in the classroom only speak Spanish. “Because I also work as one of the Latino Outreach Ambassadors for Luddy Indianapolis, I try my best to talk to these Latinx students about college as much as possible. I want them to know that I understand their struggles as a Latina woman myself; I want them to understand that there is a place for them out there,” she said.  “Furthermore, being able to work at Arsenal Technical High School now and help these students find their voice in tech as I did mine is a big highlight for me. I am thrilled to see how performance in the classroom has increased now that they can understand what they are doing and the importance of it. Getting to know these students and understanding what about tech makes them passionate is a reward like no other.”  I never thought the iDEW program would impact me as much as it did in high school and continue to impact me to this day.  Dominguez-Chang said the best advice she could give other would-be mentors is to not doubt themselves and go for it. She pointed out that when she first started off, she was hesitant, as she did not know what she would be able to offer the students she was going to be working with. “As time goes on, you realize that the best thing you can do is become a resource,” she said. “You are not expected to know everything. Your individual experiences are more than enough to help these students create their own paths. In doing so, I have become more confident in my skills and in my ability to help guide these students in the right direction. If you think you can’t do it, you can. You never know what the outcome will be.”  Maybe so. But perhaps we are already able to see a glimpse of that outcome at Arsenal Tech, thanks to her efforts.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Students test new career app at recent job fair  March 11, 2019  Over the past year and half, Fawzi Ben Messaoud, Ph.D., informatics faculty member at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, has led a group of his students in developing a web-based career matching tool, the Learning Path and Career eXchange Application.  Ben Messaoud saw a need for an improved way for college students, alumni, and potential employers to easily exchange information before, during, and after meeting, and facilitate their time in face-to face-interactions. According to Ben Messaoud, “This application will allow students to build, manage, and present their personal brand to potential employers thus maximizing their chances of exposure, opportunities, and use of time to search and select jobs and internship opportunities.” He said the application is also open to employers who can use it to publish a company overview, testimonials from previous hires, job and internship opportunities; easily search and select talents; and view, save, and communicate with matched talents.  Human-Computer Interaction graduate student Niranjan Kshirisagar is the UX designer on the project, assisting Ben Messaoud with the development of the various features of the app, such as student profile sharing and interaction with employer information. “Before this application we used to get printouts about employers and their details…now we get all the information on the application itself,” he said.  Recently, School of Informatics and Computing students beta-tested the app at the school’s Spring Career Fair. The app assisted students in interacting with potential employers and vice-versa—through an interface that allowed them to promote their personal brand by posting background information from their so-called Digital Passport within Career eXchange. For example, students were able to share an introductory video, resume, and cover letter that employers could access. They also logged their visits with each employer and rated the experience for follow up. This opened channels for future communication between the two.  Career Services advisor Pat Rhodes has been working closely with Ben Messaoud to make sure the tool is useful to both the students she advises and the employers she invites to the fair. “I love that this app allows employers to connect with top talent before, during and after the career fair.  Students, regardless if they attend the fair or not, are able to upload their resumes and portfolios, which employers can match to opportunities within their organizations,” Rhodes said.   ### Preparation, preparation, preparation  Three of the students who used the app at the spring career fair shared their experiences before, during, and after the beta test. Holly Handlon, Taryn Husted, and Dwight Hall came prepared to talk to employers they had already identified as interested in their skill set as a result of using the app.  Handlon, a junior studying informatics, learned about the app through a project management class taught by Ben Messaoud. She is now part of a team helping to prepare an academic paper about the app, which they will present at the International 2019 Educational Media conference in Amsterdam. “What makes this application unique is that it is directly connected to the IUPUI School of Informatics and Computing, so it gives students the opportunity to save their Capstone project, request transcripts, and connect with employers that are featured at our career fairs. All of this makes it easier for students to connect with potential employers on a platform where the employer can see what the student has accomplished thus far,” Handlon said. She spoke with Datum Solutions, Franciscan Alliance, and Harmony Healthcare, among others at the fair.  “The best part of the app for me was being able to see which employees would be at the fair and what they were looking for. This helped me plan out exactly who I wanted to talk with and what I would say to them.”  Holly Handlon  Hall, a senior informatics major who is also working on the publication team, explained what he sees as the strength of the career app, “Students can view which employers have saved them as potential candidates, and employers can see the students who have saved their company to the student’s favorites.  The application acts as a matching website that matches students to employers.  Truly, the most unique aspect of the application is that it gives IUPUI students the ability to manage their own personal brand and digital footprint in order to present themselves as the best candidate for potential employers.” He says that he was able to speak with seven companies with the help of the app. “The most helpful function of the application is that I was able to see which companies were hiring full-time, part-time, and internships.  The application also provides the company website so I was able to do research on the companies before I spoke with them at the career fair,” Hall said.  Husted is also a junior in informatics and in the project management class as well. She will be helping to refine the app over the next several months. “Having this app will help students and alumni be able to connect more with employers as well as have a place where they can store their professional documents. Likewise, I believe that this app will be beneficial due to the fact that students, once the app has become fully functional, will be able to have a detailed transcript of what they learned and how it is applicable to their skillset, as well as let employers see exactly what students have learned throughout their college career,” she said. “I talked to four companies at the career fair about different internship positions such as ones in cybersecurity or systems analysis. The app helped me to be able to single out the employers that would be the best fit for me with my skills and experience,” she added.  Plans are in the works to expand the tool to mobile phones and for other applications within the School of Informatics and Computing, and to make it available to other IU schools, eventually launching it outside the university.

    "body": "  ## Luddy students contribute to real-world data projects at The Polis Center at IUPUI  August 16, 2023  A lot of Luddy Indianapolis students work on Polis Center projects—well over 100 grads and undergrads—which gives them the opportunity to use the skills they are learning in a “real-world” practical application under supervision. Some of the work is for courses and some is for paid positions. A few have told their former supervisor that listing their efforts for Polis projects on job applications after graduation contributed significantly in being hired.  “I can say my experience with The Polis Center gave me the confidence and hands on experience on informatics-related projects, to understand the data handling in better perspective,” Chinmayi Sailaja Nimmaraju said.  Before she graduated with her degree in Health Informatics in 2022, Nimmaraju worked for The Polis Center on the State of Aging in Central Indiana Report project as part of a class team. She then worked as a Community Health Informatics RA and Health Informatics RA under Karen Frederickson Comer , associate director at Polis, on two consecutive practicums, the first one a COVID research analysis entitled Predictive Analysis of Socio-economic and Socio-vulnerable Factors in COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy in Central Indiana. The second was a literature search for all peer-reviewed articles that she could find that mention SAVI Community Information System .  Nimmaraju is now clinical data coordinator at Columbia University Medical Center in New York.  [The Polis Center](https://polis.iupui.edu/)  [Karen Frederickson Comer](https://polis.iupui.edu/members/karen-frederickson-comer/)  [SAVI Community Information System](https://polis.iupui.edu/initiatives/savi/)  Comer said, “Chinmayi first became engaged with Polis via a class project to write about health trends in the older adult population. Using vaccination data collected for her class project, she then proposed an individual practicum to use SAVI community-level data to explore social determinants of vaccine hesitancy.  She rounded out her experience at Polis by completing a scoping literature review to help describe SAVI contributions to biomedical research.  I am delighted that Chinmayi used her Luddy training and work experience to secure an excellent bioinformatics job upon graduation!”  Vijay Mittal is assistant vice president at Barclays (NJ). He earned his masters degree in Applied Data Science.  Jay Colbert , data manager at Polis, who supervised Mittal, said, “Vijay was always an important part of our data processing team with his experience and professionalism.  Even though he was a student intern with us he basically operated as a full-time staff employee.  His contributions were such that I nominated him for IUPUI’s Student Employee of the year Award and also for IUPUI’s Elite 50.”  [Jay Colbert](https://polis.iupui.edu/members/jay-colbert/)  From May 2021 to May 2022, Mittal worked on multiple tasks within multiple projects, including the SAVI community information system, The State of Aging in Central Indiana report, and the Domestic Violence Network report.  His tasks involved data manipulation and programming using software such as SQL Server, SSIS, Microsoft Office, mSQL, ArcGIS, and other data-related applications.   ### Projects with a community focus  The Polis Center website describes their various internships: “The Polis Center is pleased to offer student positions that provide students an opportunity to put the informatics skills they are learning into practice via community-focused projects. Desired skill sets include programming R, Python, MS SQL, data analysis, GIS, social media, visualizations, graphic design, and others, as individual projects require. Positions range from in-person, hybrid, or remote, and depend on the assigned project(s).”  [internships:](https://polis.iupui.edu/about/employment/)  Students are involved in work from the Polis Center’s three emphasis areas of Community Informatics, Community Health Informatics, and Geoinformatics, including:  [State of Aging in Central Indiana Report](https://centralindiana.stateofaging.org/)  Other projects they are working on:   ### About Polis Center at IUPUI  The Polis Center is a research center in the IU Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering at IUPUI.

    "body": "  ## Professor helping to preserve Arecibo telescope’s data legacy  August 9, 2021  There are still discoveries waiting to be made from the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico.  Its famous 300-meter radio dish–the world’s largest for decades–sustained damage in 2020, and the telescope shut down. But thanks to an international community of scientists and researchers, including a School of Informatics and Computing faculty member, Arecibo’s thousands of hours of viewing data will be available for researchers to make new discoveries for many years to come.  [School of Informatics and Computing](https://luddy.iupui.edu/)  [thousands of hours of viewing data](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/-/continuing-arecibo-s-legacy)  Through her collaboration with a far-flung team of researchers, Angela Murillo , assistant professor of library, information and data science, is helping to archive a treasure trove of astronomical data from the Arecibo radio telescope dating back to the 1960s.  [Angela Murillo](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/angela-murillo/)  Through two projects funded by the National Science Foundation, Murillo and her colleagues have been working to preserve and exchange scientific data, and promote the exchange of cyberinfrastructure knowledge from Arecibo and other major NSF facilities.  Indiana University, the University of Notre Dame, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and the University of Southern California were among those participating as part of the $3 million CI CoE Pilot grant.  [CI CoE Pilot](https://cicoe-pilot.org/)  To continue and expand the work the CI CoE Pilot began, Murillo and colleagues recently received a new $8 million National Science Foundation grant ( NSF #2127548 ) for 2021 to 2026, CI Compass .  [NSF #2127548](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2127548&HistoricalAwards=false)  [CI Compass](https://ci-compass.org/)  These projects provide expertise and active support to cyberinfrastructure practitioners, and have developed a data life cycle model for major NSF facilities. That’s important in the case of Arecibo, where researchers have amassed thousands of hours of observing sessions using its famous telescope, featuring a reflector dish built into a natural sinkhole.   ### On the move  Moving and securing such a massive amount of valuable scientific data is a challenge, especially on an island with limited bandwidth.  “I’ve been involved with the CI CoE Pilot since November 2019,” Murillo explains. “During 2020, I helped conduct interviews with NSF major facilities to gain a deeper understanding of various aspects of their data life cycle.  “We have also been involved in ‘deep engagements,’ where we spend a more concentrated time with a major facility and provide specific guidance on certain cyberinfrastructure aspects.”  Murillo’s work spotlights the key role of data management in scientific discovery, and how graduates from SoIC’s Library and Information Science, Informatics, and Applied Data Science programs can use their skills to make a real-world difference in astronomy, cyberinfrastructure, and other disciplines.  The skills sets she’s drawing from for the Arecibo project drive the field of data science, in specialties including data curation and analysis. SoIC graduates use these same data archiving skills throughout their careers, to develop databases with a user-centered focus that balance accessibility with security, data life cycle, and ethical concerns.   ### A team effort  [callout type=”right”]   ### Arecibo milestones  Puerto Rico’s Arecibo Observatory has played a vital role in astrophysics and radio astronomy. Highlights include:  [/callout]  Murillo is working with various partners to move the Arecibo radio telescope data to the Texas Advanced Computing Center ( TACC ). This transfer will help to expand access to over 50 years of astronomy data from the Arecibo Observatory.  [TACC](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/)  Due to its scope, this is not a quick assignment. “Our involvement with Arecibo has been one of these more longer-term engagement,” Murillo says. “We began working on various cyberinfrastructure aspects; however, my focus has been on data archiving and long-term preservation, as well as dissemination of the data.”  “There are many people involved from the CI CoE Pilot, all of whom bring vital expertise to the project,” Murillo says.  “And there are multiple partner organizations , including TACC, UCF (University of Central Florida), EPOC (Engagement and Performance Operations Center), Globus , and others. All are helping to ensure that this important data is managed and made accessible for astronomers and scientists to continue Arecibo’s legacy.  [multiple partner organizations](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/-/continuing-arecibo-s-legacy)  [EPOC](https://epoc.global/)  [Globus](https://www.globus.org/)  “Knowing that I am helping in just a small way to preserve this data for future scientists is very important to me,” Murillo says. “I am very proud of being involved with a project that brings to so many people together and shows how projects can come together and collaborate for the greater scientific good.”   #### Disclaimer  This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Nos. 1842042 and 2127548.

    "body": "  ## Luddy Indianapolis student is on top team at HCI challenge  May 17, 2023  Mandar Bhoyar, a Luddy Indianapolis student earning his master’s in Human-Computer Interaction, was part of the winning team earlier this year at the Streaming Wars Design Challenge 2023 held at Indiana University’s Bloomington campus.  [Streaming Wars Design Challenge 2023](https://news.luddy.indiana.edu/story.html?story=HCId-Connect-event-delivered-a-challenge-and-career-preparation)  Bhoyar (above, left) teamed with Bloomington students Varun Pimplé and Waleed Zuberi to win the competition. A total of six students from the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering in Indianapolis were among those competing.  “I’m very proud to see our students proactively seeking experiential learning opportunities like this outside the classroom, leveraging the career and design events available throughout Luddy,” says Davide Bolchini , Luddy Indianapolis professor and chair of the school’s Department of Human-Centered Computing.  [Davide Bolchini](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/davide-bolchini/)  “Working on real-world problems in such fast-paced, ‘sprint-like’ environments contributes to hone fundamental problem-finding and design competences that are much in demand in the competitive UX industry.”  Bhoyar agreed, noting “The Streaming Wars Design Challenge 2023 at HCI/d Connect was a fantastic and rewarding opportunity to test my UX research and project management skills.”   ### Solving a real-life consumer entertainment challenge  The design challenge was to re-envision what it means to consume streaming video media, given the rising trend in streaming subscription fatigue. “We had to tackle how to make streaming services healthier and generate more revenue,” he explained.  “We only had an hour to understand the problem statement,” Bhoyar says, “choose a design direction, conduct background research for our ideas, discuss the findings, ideate, and prepare the Shark Tank-style presentation!”  Nine teams gave micro presentations (five minutes or less). For winning the competition, Bhoyar and his teammates got a mentoring session with Jon Moore (Principal, Practice Lead – Product Design) and Izsadora (Izzy) Johnson (Associate Product Design) of Innovatemap, an Indianapolis digital products agency.  “Jon and Izzy were very kind to give us one hour of out their busy schedule,” Bhoyar says. “They answered our questions regarding a career in UX, the tools they use as UX practitioners, and successful storytelling methods. It was a very insightful conversation!”   ### New student ends up a winner  Bhoyar had only completed one semester at Luddy Indianapolis at the time of the Design Challenge.

[Andrew Miller’s](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/andrew-miller/)  “I find the research-focused teachings at Luddy Indianapolis to be extremely valuable,” Bhoyar added.  “Research can greatly inform and enhance the design decisions made, resulting in more user-friendly and effective products or services.  “I believe that with every class I take, I am molding into the best UX researcher I can be,” he continued.  “I say this because Luddy Indianapolis offers courses in various disciplines of Human-Computer Interaction that require different ways of practicing user experience development.”  [Human-Computer Interaction](https://luddy.iupui.edu/hcc/graduate/hci/)   ### Looking ahead  Bhoyar is the founder of Developmental Ladder, which he describes as an interview podcast designed to connect parents and caretakers with researchers and experts (in various parenting topics) to disseminate information in a simplified form.  “I am hugely motivated by the speed at which technology enhances people’s lives,” he says.  “The impact is immediate and very noticeable. Therefore, as a user experience researcher, I want to contribute to technology’s growth ethically, responsibly, and safely while advocating for users through each step of the process – as Luddy Indianapolis has taught me.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## N485 class presents third installment of Return of Aetheria game series at Indy PopCon 2015  June 23, 2015  Return of Aetheria: Rise of Nether marks the end of the game series from the School of Informatics and Computing production course.  They’ve done it again! The production class at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI is back with a third and final installment of the multi-platform, alternate reality game – Return of Aetheria.  The students of the New Media N485 class in the Media Arts and Science program are unveiling the last of the three part series Return of Aetheria: Rise of Nether at Indy PoPCon, June 26-28 at the Convention Center in downtown Indianapolis.  “It is going to be bittersweet this year,” said Mathew Powers, professor of the N485 class. “It has been a great experience for the students. They got a taste of a real-world project, and how much that goes into it. They spent many hours, as did faculty, getting it ready, everything from character development and strategy to artwork, and integrating the technology. A lot of hard work and it will be over in just a few short days.”  The second in the series Return of Aetheria: War of Realms was introduced at PoPCon last year, and ended with the Earth Realm in chaos and deceit. In the finale being presented this year, ‘Rise of Nether’, it is up to the player to master an element, help destroy Espir and Nether, and take back the realms!  PoPCon attendees will be able to play for free! The game is played on many platforms and involves mini-games and quests that take you from the main Return of Aetheria booth 262, outside to sites all around the convention. Prizes will be given out many times during the course of the game and there will be a create-your-own-bundle prize for the four highest scoring players.  Early sign-up is available on the Return of Aetheria website (returnofaetheria.org).  Get ready, master your element, and help us defeat the evil in Aetheria – Visit Booth 262!   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## NSF grant helps IUPUI faculty explore how to eliminate barriers to accessibility  October 3, 2019  Erin Brady (above), Ph.D. and assistant professor of human-computer interaction at IUPUI’s Department of Human-Centered Computing, has received a grant to identify ways that socio-technical systems can promote collaborative efforts to solve accessibility problems in the workplace.  [Erin Brady](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/erin-brady/)  [Department of Human-Centered Computing,](https://luddy.iupui.edu/hcc/)  As principal investigator, Brady is working with co-principal investigator Davide Bolchini, Ph.D. and chair of the School of Informatics and Computing’s Department of Human-Centered Computing. Their project will bring together people with and without disabilities to brainstorm solutions to accessibility issues. “Building Mutual Expertise for Physical Accessibility in Workplaces” is funded by a 3-year $487,550 Cyber-Human Systems grant from the National Science Foundation.  [Davide Bolchini,](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/davide-bolchini/)  [School of Informatics and Computing’s](https://luddy.iupui.edu/)  [“Building Mutual Expertise for Physical Accessibility in Workplaces”](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1909850)  “People with disabilities are experts in accessibility … through their daily experiences in inaccessible environments.” Erin Brady, principal investigator  Accessibility issues can prevent people with disabilities from finding and maintaining employment and being fully included in the workplace. “Most of these accessibility problems are solvable,” Brady says.  “However, not all employers are aware of the accessibility problems that exist in their workplaces, and they may not know how to implement specific accommodations or cultural changes that would be useful for employees with disabilities.”  The project draws inspiration from collective access, a principle developed by Disability Justice activists to recognize the value of personalized approaches to accessibility, informed by people with disabilities themselves.  “People with disabilities are experts in accessibility,” Brady says.  “They develop knowledge of common accessibility problems, workarounds, and strategies through their daily experiences in inaccessible environments. This knowledge can be an invaluable resource to employers who want to make their workplaces more accessible, but don’t know where to start.”  Brady and Bolchini’s project will begin by identifying existing practices and attitudes of people with disabilities and employers around problem-solving for accessibility. Researchers will interview disabled employees and job-seekers, as well as co-workers and employers without disabilities.  “Most of these accessibility problems are solvable.” Erin Brady  The project will include a series of small collective access groups where people with disabilities and workplace stakeholders will collaborate on identifying and solving accessibility problems. Through these, researchers seek to identify strategies and technologies to improve how people with and without disabilities can communicate about accessibility and eliminate barriers to access in the workplace.  “This research will contribute to our understanding of how disability impacts experiences in workplaces,” Brady says, “and how technologies can be designed to improve these experiences through building mutual expertise.”  “This is a very exciting project,” says co-principal investigator Davide Bolchini.  “One of the novel perspectives this research brings is to investigate the design space of social technologies that will enable people with and without disabilities to share complementary—and often untapped—expertise.”  And, Bolchini notes, “This highly competitive NSF award is a recognition of the leadership of our Human-Computer Interaction faculty in the field of accessible computing research.”  [Human-Computer Interaction](https://luddy.iupui.edu/hcc/graduate/hci/)   ### Acknowledgment  This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1909850 .  Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation.​  [Grant No. 1909850](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1909850)   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

[Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce (iDEW)](https://luddy.iupui.edu/idew/)  A total of 183 students from nine iDEW classrooms presented at the project showcase events. Classes completing the first iDEW semester demonstrated their mobile trivia apps, while second-year students completing the third iDEW class invited guests to play their video games.  Faculty from the Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI—and jurors from Angie’s List, Girls Scouts of Central Indiana, IndianaFIRST, Interactive Intelligence, and TechPoint Foundation for Youth—evaluated team posters, projects, and student presentations at the semester-end showcases to determine first- and second-place teams in each class.  A unique initiative that prepares a diverse cross section of Indianapolis high school students for careers in information technology, the iDEW program was recognized with a US2020 STEM Mentoring Award this year at the White House.  [the iDEW program was recognized with a US2020 STEM Mentoring Award](https://luddy.iupui.edu/news/story/idew-white-house)  Feedback from students and teachers at Arsenal Technical High School are a compelling testimony to the success of the iDEW program in its first two years.  “Thank you for helping us and being here in our class. I learned a lot from your help and this class, and hope to use the knowledge I got from this class in my future career as computer programmer,” said a first-year iDEW student.  “Thank you so much for this great experience that you were a huge part of. This wouldn’t be possible if you weren’t able to provide us with the resources and the content that we need. I really appreciate that you were able to narrow my career path down to something that I would love to do in the future. Hopefully in the near future you will be seeing me on the IUPUI campus doing something that will benefit me and my future,” said a second-year iDEW student.  “I want to thank you guys for all the help you gave us in seeing our imaginations put to life on the screen. I want to thank you for the t-shirts, food, and gift cards that you gave us. I had never been into computers or programming, but I thought I might get into this class because some of my friends are in it. I realized I really like it. I like it so much that I do it outside of school and work on my own projects. So thank you for inspiring me to get out of my comfort zone and to help find a passion I will have for the rest of my years,” said a second-year iDEW student.  “Thank you for the wonderful opportunity for my students. I have taught in multiple school districts and this experience has been the most engaging and life-changing curriculum I have ever witnessed. I have truly enjoyed watching my students grow not only in their coding skills, but in their self-confidence, problem solving, and group collaboration skills. When I think back to when we first started with our groups a few months ago, to what we witnessed last Friday at our showcase, the growth has been incredible. I have received many compliments around campus about Friday’s activity. I look forward to working with everyone next semester with our Internet of Things activity and using the curriculum for years to come,” said Susan Reagin, computer science classroom teacher.  Next semester, iDEW students will embark on the study of Internet of Things (IoT), and Data and Visualization.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## The Negotiation Process  Negotiation is very common in the hiring process. It is an opportunity for you to have a dialogue with your employer about the components of your offer. Below is a breakdown of the negotiation process and the important steps you should take to ensure a successful negotiation.   ### When do you negotiate?  Timing is very important. You must be sure to begin the negotiation process after you have received an offer from the employer and before you have accepted it. If you attempt to negotiate after providing the employer with a verbal acceptance, you may risk losing your offer.   ### What do you need to know to negotiate?  Before you negotiate, research and come prepared with information to justify what you are asking for. Want to increase your salary? Refer to the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering hiring statistics and average salaries for our graduates. Know the average salary for employees in that company in similar positions. Helpful resources include salary.com, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and NACE salary.  Be specific and knowledgeable. If you need help finding this information, contact our office.   ### What do you negotiate?  Almost everything is negotiable. Common negotiable aspects of an offer include the following: salary, start date, moving expenses, early reviews, vacation time, professional development money, performance bonuses, geographic location, parking, stock options, company car, retention bonuses, and remote/hybrid work arrangements.   ### How do you negotiate?  First, you must show appreciation for the offer as it stands. Ask questions and make sure you know all facets of the offer before you begin the negotiation process. When you begin the negotiation process, begin by reiterating your interest in the position and appreciation for the offer, and ask for time to make your decision.  Make sure your request is specific and actionable. So, say “I’d like to discuss the salary and the possibility of increasing the starting salary to $60,000” instead of, “I’d like to make more money than $55,000.”  You must give the employer an appropriate amount of time to answer. If your answer has been requested by Friday, don’t call and begin the negotiation process on Thursday at 3 p.m. Give them enough time to listen to your requests and come up with a counteroffer.   ### What are some common mistakes?  Candidates make mistakes when they start the negotiation process too soon (i.e., before receiving the offer) or negotiate with the wrong person. You should always negotiate with your specific recruiting contact or the person who has been organizing your interview process. Additionally, if you do not adequately prepare your argument and appear greedy as a result, you risk creating a negative impression of yourself during the process and starting your new career off on the wrong foot.   ### Five Ingredients for a Successful Negotiation "

Duke, M.D., and Jeffrey Klann, M.Eng., students of the Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing and medical informatics fellows at the Regenstrief Institute and Indiana University School of Medicine, have been recognized by the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) for their development and testing of two new physician support computer tools. Their work has the potential to improve patient safety and healthcare quality while lowering costs.  Duke was awarded the 2009 outstanding student award by AMIA for his development and evaluation of Rxplore, an innovative graphic visualization tool to help physicians pinpoint which drugs in a patient’s regimen may cause particular adverse reactions. His work will be published in the Journal of Medical Bioinformatics in 2010.  “Physicians are able to retrieve accurate side-effect information significantly faster using Rxplore than when using traditional drug information resources. They unanimously indicated that they preferred the visual presentation of the data,” said Duke.  An internist with a long time interest in the application of computers to medicine for practical purposes, Duke is completing a Master of Science in Human Computer Interaction at the IU School of Informatics and Computing. He received his M.D. degree from Harvard Medical School.  Klann was named an award finalist for his work focusing on presenting meaningful medical test and medication options to physicians.  To describe his research, Klann uses an online shopping analogy. “If you order a book on Amazon.com, the website suggests other books that you might be interested in based on what’s often purchased with it. What if physicians could do this when they ordered medical tests or considered what drug to prescribe for the patient? In this vein, I developed a computer tool to generate test order and medication suggestions based on a year of electronic hospital records.”  Klann is a doctoral student at the IU School of Informatics and Computing, pursuing a Ph.D. in Informatics with a concentration in Health Informatics. He received his Master in Engineering in Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## NSF Grant to Rethink Drug-Drug Interaction Alerts for Better Compliance  February 25, 2014  Jon Duke, M.D., assistant professor at the IU School of Medicine and chief innovation officer at the Regenstrief Institute, and Davide Bolchini, PhD, assistant professor of human-centered computing at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI have been awarded over $589,000 from the National Science Foundation(NSF) to rethink the role of drug-drug interaction alerts during medication prescribing.  The 3-year grant, awarded by the NSF through the NSF-NIH interagency program “Smart and Connected Health”, allows Drs. Duke and Bolchini to develop human-computer interaction research aimed at studying the physician’s interaction with drug-drug clinical alerts in hospital setting and reimagine the design of these critical components to enhance compliance and medication safety.  “Although physicians routinely receive drug-drug interaction (DDI) alerts during daily medication prescribing, the effectiveness of such alerts remains extremely low, with up to 96% of warnings being ignored by physicians on a daily basis,” Duke said. “There is often a disconnect between the trusted advice shared by peers in collaborative decision making, and the low compliance when individuals interact with computerized safety alerts from a computer. So rather than focusing on alerts themselves, we are instead looking at how to improve the trust between physician and computer.”  “Our goal is to transform drug safety alerts from oft-ignored warnings to trusted tools that advise physicians in daily decision making,” says Bolchini. “Our starting point to address this issue is looking at whom physicians do trust: their medical colleagues and mentors. Now three months into the project, we have started investigating principles for alert design that are based on what physicians consider important when taking advice from peers in their daily clinical work. A key aspect of the work is to generate alerts that are perceived as collaborating with the providers rather than critiquing every micro-decision.” The investigators, along with graduate students in human-computer interaction from the School of Informatics and Computing, are conducting formative field studies in a variety of clinical settings to identify key factors in sharing trusted advice among doctors and residents.  They will then generate and iteratively evaluate novel designs for drug safety guidance that have the potential to elicit physician trust and maximize compliance.  The potential of this work is to generate a more complete understanding of what makes medical advice trustworthy, and how those principles can be extended to create a solid intellectual basis for the development of substantially better alerts in electronic medical record (EMR) systems.  The investigators will disseminate the project results through not only publications but real-world implementation and evaluation at Eskenazi Health System in Indianapolis. The team will also reach out to EMR vendors to promote the incorporation of their findings into current and next generation clinical systems.

    "body": "  ## $1.6M NIH research grant supports study of VR to improve perspective taking in kids  June 10, 2019  Zebulun Wood (pictured above), lecturer and co-director of the undergraduate Media Arts and Science (MAS) program, will lead a team from the IU School of Informatics and Computing as part of a $1,622,677 NIH R61 Phase 1 Exploratory/Development Grant recently awarded to Tom Hummer , assistant research professor of psychiatry at the Indiana University School of Medicine. The investigation will examine whether virtual reality (VR) can improve perspective taking and related brain function and behavior in youth with oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) or conduct disorder (CD). If successful, an additional three years of funding may be received during the R33 phase for a five-year grant total of $4.06M.  [Zebulun Wood](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/zeb-wood/)  [Tom Hummer](https://medicine.iu.edu/departments/radiology/faculty/6730/hummer-tom/)  Children and adolescents with ODD or CD, collectively known as disruptive behavioral disorders (DBDs), often have difficulties with social perspective taking that contribute to poor empathy, disruptive behaviors, and aggression. Therefore, interventions that can help their perspective taking may be able to increase empathy and improve behavior. In Hummer and Wood’s proposal, this investigation of youth with DBDs will use advanced VR technology to provide alternate perspectives of an interpersonal conflict, and provide valuable information regarding the potential for VR to be integrated into therapeutic strategies with this population.  “VR has exciting potential as a therapeutic tool to address perspective-taking deficits because it can provide natural environments in which users can easily experience social interactions from multiple viewpoints.”  In the R61 phase, participants will experience interpersonal conflicts via VR and answer questions regarding their ability to understand a virtual counterpart’s perspective. Participants will then experience scenarios from the virtual counterpart’s point-of-view, in a more immersive manner than imagination or role-playing would provide. Wood and selected students from the School of Informatics and Computing will create multiple scenarios that children might experience in the real world, such as in a school cafeteria, classroom, or living room. “We want to create situations that kids really live through, so they can better understand all sides of the interactions they have every day,” says Hummer.  Wood says, “The Media Arts and Science students’ skills acquired from the 3D animation and game design and development specializations are perfectly aligned to create these empathy training exercises for the study. With positive data, there is a large promise to expand the use of VR in mental health domains such as meditation or phobias, or PTSD.  These media arts and sciences skill-sets are far more valuable and accessible outside of the entertainment industry than ever before”  The study will also measure brain activity via MRI, which will be compared to a baseline taken prior to exposure. The goal is to determine how well the VR programs affect thoughts and brain activity related to perspective taking, so the team has a better idea about how to incorporate VR into mental health treatment. Hummer says, “Disruptive behavior disorders are costly to families and society, but effective treatments are often tricky to implement. We’re hoping VR can expand the toolset for clinicians and families, addressing these behavior problems in a way that is innovative and engaging.”  Wood and Hummer’s investigation will proceed to the R33 phase if milestone criteria are met for engagement of both psychological and neural targets. Their work can confirm the potential for VR to be used to help improve perspective taking and poor social-cognitive skills in youth with DBDs and will lay the foundation for assessing whether VR tools can improve DBD symptoms as a stand-alone program or adjunct to clinical treatment.  Hummer says he has been “very impressed by the work of the MAS students, so I’m excited to continue our collaboration. The field of psychiatry can benefit immensely from new digital media tools, so this relationship has a lot of potential moving forward, especially within the realm of mental health.”   ### About Zebulun Wood  Zeb Wood’s comfort zone is at the edge of emerging media, focusing in 3D design integrated formats. He has worked with students on projects that improve lives and disrupt industries, and instructs in all areas of 3D production, including augmented and virtual reality. Throughout his teaching and volunteer efforts, Wood continues to seek collaboration. He is currently leading projects that explore the use of augmented reality, 3D and 3D printing in prosthetic design, augmented reality in education, and education for innovation and entrepreneurial thinking.   ### About Tom Hummer  Tom Hummer received his Ph.D. in computational neuroscience from the University of Chicago, and joined the IU School of Medicine Department of Psychiatry in 2009.  At IUSM, he joined a team using neuroimaging to examine how media violence exposure affects the brain. Since that time, he has utilized neuropsychological, behavioral, and neuroimaging tools to examine how different forms of digital media use impact brain structure and function, particularly during childhood and adolescence. He also employs neuroimaging to examine adolescent risky decision-making in areas such as substance use and sexual behavior.   ### About NIH R61 Phase 1 Exploratory/Developmental Grant  An NIH R61 is a Phase 1 Exploratory/Developmental Grant funding mechanism for preliminary data to be obtained within the first two years of an overall 5-year R33 project.

    "body": "  ## IUPUI’s Gamers’ Guild holds gaming tournament to benefit Riley Kids  March 31, 2011  A dedicated group of student gamers at IUPUI hope to help bring a smile to some deserving children’s faces with the first-ever “1-Up for Riley” gaming tournament and fundraiser benefiting Indiana University Health’s Riley Hospital for Children.  “1-Up for Riley” is a Pokémon card and video game tournament scheduled for April 9th from 12 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. in IUPUI’s Informatics and Communications Technology Complex (535 W. Michigan). To participate, entrants must bring a cash donation or new, packaged game from Riley’s Amazon.com Wish List. All proceeds and donations will be used to supply patients at Riley with much-needed board, card and other games to play during their stay.  The event is organized by the Gamers’ Guild, a recognized IUPUI student organization founded in 2003 and sponsored by the School of Informatics and Computing. The group’s mission is to provide a place for members of the IUPUI community to come together in celebration of their mutual passion for gaming in all its formats.  The fundraiser stems from the group’s recent desire to give back to the local community, in part to fight negative stereotypes of gamers as lazy and uninvolved. During a lunch at the McDonald’s within Riley Hospital for Children, the idea took root that there is no better audience to share in the group’s love of gaming than kids – particularly those whose access to or supply of games for entertainment may be limited due to hospitalization and illness. And the “1-Up for Riley” concept was born.  Gamers’ Guild members hope to eventually personally play donated games with the children at Riley, and has goals of seeing at least one hundred people participate with $500 in cash or gift donations raised.  More information can be found through the Gamers’ Guild’s website at www.gg.drakeweb.net.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Informatics prof co-authors study to help make personal health records more usable  January 13, 2012  Although personal health records are now securely accessible online to a large and growing number of individuals, little research has been conducted on opinions about their ease of use.  A new study, co-authored by Josette Jones, associate professor of Health Informatics, recruited patients into a human-computer interaction laboratory to determine the user experience for several popular functions of the Department of Veterans Affairs’ MyHealthVet, the most widely disseminated personal health record system in the United States. The study appears in the supplement to the December 2011 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association .  Gaining insight into facilitators and barriers to adoption of MyHealthVet, the most pervasive example of patient-centered technology currently in use, will provide guidance for the design and redesign of next-generation systems.  The researchers studied four functional areas of MyHealthVet: registration and log-in; prescription refills; tracking of self-reported health information such as colonoscopy test results and physical activity diary entries; and searches for health information about specific topics such as post-traumatic stress disorder.  Once into the secure Web-based system, users found the prescription refill function to perform better than expected. More than 20 million refills have been ordered online through MyHealthVet since 2005. Some users were concerned about the system displaying the names of their specific drugs, a possible issue if using a public computer or sharing space in the home or office.  Patients indicated they thought it important that information they uploaded into their personal health record, such as blood sugar or blood pressure levels over time, be downloadable as graphs that they could print and bring to a future doctor’s visit.  Patients in the future will expect to access their personal health information through Web portals tethered or linked to hospital systems or HMOs, or other entities where they receive their care, the study authors note. Overall, users in this study sought aspects of personal health records that were “adding value” to their interaction with their VA care providers.

    "body": "  ## School of Informatics and Computing Develops Massive Multiplayer Game for Gen Con  August 14, 2013  When Gen Con opens its doors in Indianapolis, a massive multiplayer alternate reality game created by 40 students and five faculty in the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI will be center stage.    The game, “Return of Aetheria,” utilizes video mapping and projectors which creates a large crystalline display, stereoscopic 3D, a phone app, the entire convention center as a play area and costumed actors portraying characters in the game.  The game was developed as a result of an educational partnership between Gen Con and the school’s Media Arts and Science program.  The students and faculty have worked eight months on the project, crafting a game based on the theme of an epic quest to restore magic to the world. The phone app will guide players through various quests to save the world and bring back magic to it.  As quests are completed, players will see the results upon the large crystalline display in real time through video mapping projectors. As the game continues, more and more dramatic events will appear on the crystalline structure and surrounding space.  “We are blurring the lines between reality and the game through the use of cutting-edge technology. Having the entire convention center space act as our play-area will bring an uncanny gaming experience to all our players,” said Powers.  One of the largest gaming conventions in the world, Gen Con attracted 40,000 visitors in 2012. Known for introducing revolutionary gaming to the public, the annual convention has taken place in Indianapolis since 2003. The 2013 Gen Con takes place August 15-18 at the Indianapolis Convention Center.  The partnership between Gen Con and the Media Arts and Science program brings together an event that is committed to the advancement of play and gaming and an academic program that that is dedicated to the creation and production of games.  “We are combining several unique levels of technology and game design to create this experience,” said Mathew Powers, a lecturer in the Media Arts and Science program, and the project’s leader. “This has never been attempted before at this level and we will demonstrate what the heck we can do, because I think we do some amazing things here.”  The project has involved 3 D and 2 D artists, video mapping, animators, computer programmers and narrators and actors who will be costumed and role playing as part of the game.  “Since the partnership was established last year, the Media Arts and Science program has added two classes, one on pre-production and the other on production of games,” Powers said. “While students learn how to create games, he said, perhaps, most importantly they gain what potential employers want: the real world experience of actually doing it.”  Powers plans to have students add to the game each year, creating new versions for display at future conventions.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Celebrating our three Top 100 students at Luddy Indianapolis  May 24, 2023  Katy Stewart, Kavin Thakkar, and Nicholas Dibley  (pictured above, left to right) were selected as the IUPUI Top 100 students from Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering at IUPUI in 2023. Each year, the IUPUI Office of Alumni Relations honors 100 outstanding undergraduate students who demonstrate excellence in three categories—academic excellence, campus leadership, and community engagement. Juniors and seniors in good standing are eligible for nomination. Stewart, Thakkar, and Dibley are prime examples of Luddy students who fully pursued the educational and extracurricular opportunities offered here at IUPUI.  [IUPUI Top 100](https://top100.iupui.edu/about/past-recipients/)   ### Katy Stewart  Stewart is a junior majoring in Biomedical Informatics. She is a member of the Honors College and Alpha Lambda Delta/Phi Eta Sigma (ALDPES) honor societies.  “I knew I wanted to be in the medical field and hoped to go to medical school, but I also was passionate about user design and specifically ethics within technology. I was just unsure of how to combine the two since they seemed drastically different. I originally came to IUPUI as a biology major and minoring in graphic design knowing that IUPUI offered an abundance of research opportunities and clinical experiences. I wasn’t even aware there was a biomedical informatics track until the end of my freshman year and everything immediately seemed to fall into place,” Stewart said.  Stewart took an introduction to informatics class where she was able to design a mockup of an electronic health record interface, and from there on she found her niche. She switched her major to biomedical informatics with a premedical specialization and has been working towards her degree since.  Stewart has taken part in multiple research opportunities available at IUPUI. She is currently in the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program through Life-Health Sciences Internship (LHSI) program at IUPUI where she works with Dr. Titus Schleyer and is the project manager and researcher studying the efficiency of an Electronic Health Record application that is used in the emergency department. She started in the summer of 2021 and has worked there ever since. Stewart is also Research Assistant at Mayo Clinic under Dr. Elizabeth Umberfield where she is currently working on putting together a study evaluating user trust of clinical AI tools. Starting in the summer of 2021, she became a Pathology Research Assistant under Dr. George Sandusky at IU School of Medicine and has worked there since.  In addition, she volunteers at Gennesaret Free Clinics and Gleaners Food Bank of Indiana.  In Fall 2022, Stewart had the opportunity to go to the American Medical Informatics Association Annual Symposium in Washington, D.C. for a week. “It was one of the most rewarding experiences. I was able to meet physicians and researchers from all over and present to them my research. I wouldn’t have been able to do this without the financial support of the BioHealth Grant at Luddy IUPUI and the LHSI program,” she said.  She will be applying to an MD/Ph.D. program where she can continue to do research in the clinical informatics and bioethics fields, while also studying medicine to become a practicing physician.   ### Kavin Thakkar  Thakkar is a junior majoring in Informatics  with a specialization in human-computer interaction. He is a member of the Honors College and ALDPES and is in the Accelerated 4+1 program, which will allow him to complete his master’s degree in HCI in one additional year after completing his bachelor’s degree.  “I chose to study informatics and human-computer interaction after learning about user experience (UX) and it grabbing my attention at summer camps while in high school. So I looked for that kind of program at urban universities and found IUPUI and the School of Informatics and Computing (now Luddy). I saw that SoIC had a great program and was a school based on a user-centered approach.”  “‘Why did I choose Luddy?’—I didn’t. Luddy chose us.” – Kavin Thakkar (when asked about his choice of schools)  Freshman year (2020-2021), Thakkar joined Circle K International (CKI), the world’s largest collegiate service organization, and became a board member of the club. He also joined the Undergraduate Student Government (USG) as a Senator representing CKI, joining the Oversight Committee and the Election Committee. That same year, he co-founded the Coffee and Computers Podcast student organization with fellow SoIC students and served as President for his freshman and sophomore years.  His sophomore year, Thakkar continued as a USG Senator for CKI and served on the Oversight and the Constitutional Committee. He was elected Bulletin Editor and Electronic Publicist (BEEP) for CKI, managing the club’s social media and website and as part of an Honors  project created an award-winning promotional video. He also became an Undergraduate Ambassador for the School and started working at the front desk and served as an FYS Mentor for new students.  Junior year, Thakkar was elected Vice President of Membership and Marketing for CKI and currently serve as acting President and was confirmed to the Executive Board of USG as its Chief of Staff. He also started working at CourseNetworking as a UX/UI design intern. He was recognized as Outstanding Club Board Member by the Indiana District of CKI in February 2021 and as Member of the Year by CKI at IUPUI in April 2021. He was recognized as 2022 USG Verbal Ambassador of the Year, 2022 USG Legislative Author of the Year, and 2022 USG Committee Member of the Year by the CUBE Student Organization Center.  Going into his senior year, Thakkar will serve as CKI President and continue as USG Chief of Staff.  Thakkar is also a member of  DesiJags, Indian Student Cultural Association, and other clubs on campus. He plans to work as a UX professional after graduating with his bachelor’s and master’s degrees.   ### Nicholas Dibley  Dibley is a senior studying Biomedical Informatics in the Accelerated 4+1 degree program. He received his B.S. this May and will complete an M.S. in Bioinformatics next year. He is also a member of the Honors College and is a second year Top 100 student, having received the honor his junior year as well.  “The more I looked into it, the more I saw that (biomedical informatics) was a perfect combination of everything that I was looking for; namely, computer science, health and the human body, and math. This looked great, so I started to investigate Biomedical Informatics a bit more and discovered IUPUI’s accelerated program through which I could obtain a master’s degree in 5 years. It wasn’t much longer before I decided that this was the path I wanted to pursue,” Dibley said.  Dibley served as IUPUI Student-Athlete Advisory Committee (SAAC) president, Horizon League SAAC secretary, secondary Horizon League representative for the NCAA Division 1’s SAAC, IUPUI Swim team captain, Team Impact liaison, and secretary of the Bioinformatics Club, as well as a tutor at Luddy. He also volunteered at the Children’s Museum of Indianapolis, the Indianapolis Zoo, the Indianapolis Convention Center, Riley’s Children’s Hospital, and St. John the Evangelist Catholic Church.  He received the Michael A. Carroll Scholarship last semester, which is an annual scholarship given to those athletes about to begin their last year of competition at IUPUI. The winner is chosen from among ten finalists who demonstrate athletic success, academic prowess, and a commitment to community service. He recently received the Horizon League Post-Graduate Scholarship , the first from IUPUI, and is a two-time member of the Horizon League All-Academic Team.  [Horizon League Post-Graduate Scholarship](https://horizonleague.org/news/2023/5/11/iupuis-dibley-oaklands-lagrand-awarded-horizon-league-post-graduate-scholarships.aspx)  Dibley has been accepted to an internship this summer at the Indiana Biosciences Research Institute and is looking forward to gaining real-world experience there before starting graduate school in the fall. After graduate school, he plans on working at a research institution as a Bioinformatics Research Scientist. “Genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis have always piqued my interest and I believe that fully diving into research in this area will yield great results. The many connections that IUPUI has to offer around Indy are just a few of many examples of how this program could jump-start my career and help me reach my goals.  For as long as I have known about this major, I have wanted to conduct my own research on genetic disease. Graduating with a master’s degree in bioinformatics from IUPUI would give me the tools and resources to do just that,” Dibley said.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Bunmi Akintomide Alumni Spotlight  December 3, 2020  Bunmi Akintomide (BS, Informatics, 2013; MS, Human-Centered Computing, 2015) is a Systems Specialist Manager at Salesforce, where he manages the marketing team within their Business Technology space. During his time at SoIC, he served as a student mentor for the Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce (iDEW) program. Bunmi was kind enough to share his remembrances of his time in the School of Informatics and Computing and with iDEW, and his current work with Salesforce.  In Informatics, Bunmi discovered a field that merged his primary interests. “I love people and technology. Informatics was the field that was perfect for that combination. It allows me to use technology to solve problems that we face in our day to day lives,” Bunmi tells us. In Human-Computer Interaction, Bunmi’s future path in IT became clear. “Through HCI, you have the control of changing how people interact with technology, that’s my why, and the reason I chose that path.” Bunmi found an excellent fit for his interests at SoIC. “IUPUI was a perfect choice for me because the Informatics program is excellent and most importantly IUPUI is in Indianapolis. I wanted to be close to my family, and also be able to do internships to get work experience.”  Bunmi fondly recalls his time at SoIC, the instruction received, and the work he created. “I had an amazing time at SoIC, the professors were very helpful, and most importantly our career counselor (Brian Benedict) was very helpful. My most memorable work is my Capstone, where I created an app that uses AI to predict and help consumers select what clothing items to buy when they visit a store. Most people hate going into the store because they don’t know what to buy, and using the app I created, making a selection was easier. During the Capstone, my professor at the time, Stephen Voida, was a key resource to the successful completion of the project.”  Another important part of Bunmi’s time at SoIC was his role as a student mentor for the iDEW program, which provides students at Indianapolis-area high schools with high minority and/or underrepresented populations with IT curriculum and presents a pathway to college and university programs and careers in the IT field. The opportunity to work with high school students was a primary motivator for Bunmi. “I enjoyed my time with the iDEW program, especially visiting the classrooms to talk to the kids about my journey and what my day to day looks like at work,” he remembers. “Most of the students were not looking at technology as a field they want to pursue, but after my visit, I could see their eagerness to want to learn more about technology and potentially major in a technology field. I wanted to be part of this because I see how there’s a lack of diversity and representation of the underrepresented population in the IT fields. I believe it starts with the high school kids, getting them exposed to technology will play a big role in their desire in wanting to pursue a career in an IT field.”  Now a seven year veteran of the IT workforce himself, Bunmi works as Systems Specialist Manager at Salesforce here in Indianapolis. He tells us, “A typical day for me involves meeting with our product team, engineering team, and business partners to make sure my team is successfully delivering the work, and supporting innovation within our space. It’s an amazing environment to be in, and I truly enjoy what I’m doing, and happy to work at a company like Salesforce.” Bunmi sees unlimited potential in IT’s future, and the innovations coming out of IT are particularly important in the times we live in today. He points out, “As we can see right now, technology is the main reason we can all still work remotely during this pandemic. The future of technology is great, it’s exciting how the big tech companies are innovating every day… HCI / Informatics is very important to the future of technology, because if the consumer or the users can’t interact with the technology what’s the point of it? I’m looking forward to more AI innovation, how it can be used to make our lives easier.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## HCI research and practice opens doors, practically and creatively, for alumna  July 19, 2019  [Photo: HCI alumna Jennifer Palilonis, far left, poses with BSU EMDD students at Indiana Statehouse . Used with permission]  Jennifer Palilonis was a self-described non-traditional Ph.D. student in the Human-Computer Interaction program at the IU School of Informatics and Computing (SoIC) at IUPUI in 2010. At the time, she was already a tenured professor at Ball State University, teaching full time, married with young children, and commuting from Muncie for classes. Prior to that she had been working as a journalist and had never contemplated a Ph.D. in that field, saying “I learned about the SoIC at IU and suddenly a whole new set of possibilities surfaced.”  [Human-Computer Interaction](https://luddy.iupui.edu/hcc/graduate/hci/)  She says, “I always tell people, I didn’t get a Ph.D. because I needed the degree, I got the Ph.D. because I was really interested in learning the subject matter….” Palilonis says the HCI degree is relevant to journalism because much of that field has been dramatically affected by the web, especially visual journalism. She adds that digital product development is in fact a huge focus in many media environments and HCI has a lot to offer, especially when it comes to teaching students interested in building cross-platform experiences.  Palilonis, who completed her Ph.D. in 2015, says the experience was exhausting and challenging, but she was careful to avoid the “I can’t wait until this is over mentality,” instead taking each semester, each class, each day, each assignment one moment at a time to avoid being overwhelmed. She says she loved all of her classes—especially her research rotations—and applied what she was learning to her own research. HCC Department Chair Davide Bolchini was the chair of her dissertation committee. “I also had several classes with him and consider him a great mentor and collaborator,” she says.  Her path to SoIC began after graduating from Ball State with her degree in journalism and then working at the Detroit Free Press and the Chicago Sun-Times in various positions. Along the way she instructed a newspaper design class at Wayne State University, which led to an adjunct position in Chicago and teaching summer High School Journalism Workshops at Ball State. In 2001, she applied for the position of Instructor and Journalism Graphics Sequence coordinator at Ball State, earning tenure in 2009. In 2015, Palilonis launched the Center for Emerging Media Design & Development. EMDD is a graduate program and undergraduate major focused on design thinking, transmedia storytelling, and human-computer interaction. She has also been a media design consultant, redesigning more than 30 newspapers and news websites across the country.  “…our approach to HCI is through the lens of strategic communication and experience design. There’s a ton of opportunity for people in those fields to expand their knowledge, skillsets, and ability to innovate when they add principles and practices of HCI, like usability, user experience, user-centered design, etc. to their repertoire,” Palilonis explains.  Palilonis is now involved in several high-profile projects: developing a cross-platform exhibition for David Letterman memorabilia shared with Ball State that chronicles his life and career; developing a digital literacy curriculum for grades K-5 for the Professor Garfield’s 21st Century Literacy Project, a partnership between EMDD, the Professor Garfield Foundation, and Jim Davis; and developing a documentary on the growth of boys’ and men’s’ volleyball in the U.S., a collaborative effort between EMDD, the USA men’s Olympic volleyball team, and the First Point Volleyball Foundation.  Also of note was her leadership of the Blue Roots Project, a partnership with Circle of Blue, a non-profit that covers the global water and energy crisis. Her students developed a social media campaign and design challenge that collected stories from around the world on the value of water in people’s lives.

    "body": "  ## Robots, personal safety, and moving to learn: faculty research is far-reaching  September 16, 2021  Would you accept a robot telling your children bedtime stories?  In recent publications, human-computer interaction faculty and students from the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI are exploring how technology intersects with:   ### AI and bedtime stories  In their paper “ Parental Acceptance of Children’s Storytelling Robots : A Projection of the Uncanny Valley of AI,” an alumna and faculty members from the School of Informatics and Computing examined parents’ acceptance of this new technology.  Parents used robots to tell stories to their children.  Then parents were interviewed about their child’s story time, whether they used any technology, and what they envisioned future storytelling robots might be like.  Many parents valued in-person storytelling as a time to bond with their children, and worried that a storytelling robot wouldn’t be able to interact and answer questions. But some acknowledged a bedtime story surrogate might be handy (especially when a weary parent’s “The end” is met with a toddler’s emphatic “Read it again!”)  Robots that appeared more human could make some parents feel uneasy, edging into the uncanny valley of AI, perhaps because they act sociable without really understanding themselves or others.  [uncanny valley](http://www.macdorman.com/kfm/writings/pubs/Mori1970-2012UncannyValleyIEEER&A.pdf)  The paper’s authors include Chaolan Lin, an alumnus of the SOIC Master of HCI program who is now pursuing her Ph.D. at the University of California San Diego. Other authors: Lynn Dombrowski , Andrew Miller , Erin Brady , and Karl F. MacDorman , all faculty of the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, and Selma Šabanović of IU’s Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering in Bloomington. The paper was published in Frontiers of Robotics and AI .  [Dombrowski](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/lynn-dombrowski/)  [Miller](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/andrew-miller/)  [Brady](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/erin-brady/)  [MacDorman](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/karl-macdorman/)   ### Technology and domestic violence  The United Nations estimates that globally, almost one in three women have been subjected to intimate partner violence, non-partner sexual violence, or both.  [United Nations](https://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures)  More than a third of Arab women experience domestic abuse in their lifetime, the UN estimates. IUPUI researchers asked Saudi women about their practices in response to domestic abuse and how they use technology to navigate domestic safety concerns. They learned how social media and platforms, such as Snapchat, WhatsApp, and direct messaging, offer private ways to engage with other women and seek advice.  The cost of breaking away from abusive situations is high, due to cultural and social expectations, unpredictability and scarcity of public services, and policy constraints. Thus, women may decide to manage, rather than leave, an abusive situation. They use technology to keep up with personal and professional networks, and with laws and policies; for self-improvement; to remain employable; and to develop resiliency and self-esteem.  Messaging and ride-share apps allowed women to quickly communicate concerns about their safety to friends or relatives, or to arrange to leave the home.  To support these needs, the researchers noted that designing technologies which recognize non-Western religious and cultural values can help to empower women as they navigate how to manage domestic abuse.  Their paper, “ Daughters of Men : Saudi Women’s Sociotechnical Agency Practices in Addressing Domestic Abuse,” received an honorable mention at CSCW 2020, a top-tier venue for HCI research. The paper appeared in the Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction and was written by Hawra Rabaan , IUPUI doctoral student; Lynn Dombrowski , associate professor, human-computer interaction, IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI; and Alyson L. Young , former assistant professor, IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI .  [Daughters of Men](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348260357_Daughters_of_Men_Saudi_Women%27s_Sociotechnical_Agency_Practices_in_Addressing_Domestic_Abuse)  [Rabaan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WAr0hT8AAAAJ&hl=en)  [Dombrowski](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/lynn-dombrowski/)  [Young](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Alyson-L-Young-2136092408)   ### Data and movement  In “ Show Me How You Interact, I Will Tell You What You Think : Exploring the Effect of the Interaction Style on Users’ Sensemaking about Correlation and Causation in Data,” researchers studied how people interpreted data through movement.  [Show Me How You Interact, I Will Tell You What You Think](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3461778.3462083)  As we produce more data than ever before, they note, data exploration and visualization have become increasingly important. For example, museums can offer new ways for visitors to explore through interactive displays controlled by gestures and body movements.  In the study, participants interacted with 3D globes representing geo-referenced data on a 65-inch screen. The “full body” group was able to control data visualization using mid-air gestures and body movements. The other group used a Gamepad joystick device.  The researchers discovered the groups that controlled their interactions using gestures and body movements interpreted the data differently than the GamePad group.  These findings suggest that our whole body (not just our eyes) plays an important role in how we make sense of data when we interact with data visualizations. Specific gestures may play an important role in building reasoning about data.

    "body": "  ## Privacy expert Kyle Jones says student data collection can lead to ethics concerns  August 26, 2019  Kyle Jones, assistant professor in the Department of Library and Information Science at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, is in high demand these days, conducting research on learning analytics and sharing his expertise on the ethics of data privacy across the country. Recently, he received two new grants from the Institute for Museum and Library Services (IMLS), on which he is co-PI, and was interviewed for the Hechinger Report and by WUWM, an NPR affiliate in Milwaukee, following his symposium talk on the topic of student privacy.  Jones’ $306,682 grant (LG-18-19-0032-19)—in collaboration with Amy VanScoy at the University of Buffalo— investigates faculty perspectives of student privacy and their practices in relation to emerging learning analytics tools and initiatives.  Learning analytics are becoming embedded in the practices of many higher education actors, from administrators to advisors and increasingly faculty/instructors. Jones says, “As my research argues, there are significant privacy issues associate with learning analytics. And if we accept that faculty can and often do make instructional choices when adopting educational technologies—like learning analytics—that may affect student privacy, then it follows there may be a need to further explore how faculty values, perspectives, and baseline knowledge about student privacy inform those choices.” This grant will support first-of-its-kind research in this area. and bring together librarians, faculty, and instructional technologists/designers in the final phase to collaboratively develop strategies to improve student privacy conditions at higher education institutions.  It’s vital that students be able to trust that universities won’t release personal data to the public, and that the schools get the students to consent to collecting information or allow them to opt out of disclosure.  -Kyle Jones, WUWM 89.7 interview  The $249,198 training grant (RE-18-19-0014-19)—in collaboration with Lisa Hinchliffe of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign—will support the development of a continuing education program that will train academic library practitioners to comprehensively address student privacy and fills a significant gap in academic librarians’ professional practice. Jones says the ethics of learning analytics are so paradigm-shifting that there is a real need to provide practitioners the time and space to learn, reflect on, and prepare to address emerging ethical issues, including privacy, fairness, and student autonomy and agency.  Together, the two grants will complement Jones’ existing research, which was funded by the IMLS in 2018. Andrea Copeland, chair of the Department of Library and Information Science, says, “Dr. Jones’ research is an integral component to the body of data science research in our school as it critically examines the ethical implications of data collection and use, ensuring the inclusion of humanistic approaches along side technological advances.”   ### About IMLS    The Institute of Museum and Library Services is the primary source of federal support for the nation’s approximately 120,000 libraries and 35,000 museums.

    "body": "  ## Mother Nature inspired IUPUI students’ design for a safer football helmet  May 1, 2019  (originally published May 1, 2019 in JagNews, written by John Schwarb and Rich Schneider)  Two IUPUI students drew upon the wisdom of Mother Nature to create biologically inspired designs that could be used to create a safer football helmet.  Their research has been published in the Society of Automotive Engineering International Journal of Transportation Safety.  [research has been published](https://www.sae.org/publications/technical-papers/content/2018-01-1057/)  The student authors of the paper, “Cellular Helmet Liner Design through Bio-Inspired Structures and Topology Optimization of Compliant Mechanism Lattices,” are Jacob DeHart, a media arts and science student in the School of Informatics and Computing, and Joel Najmon, an engineering student in the School of Engineering and Technology.  Zebulun Wood , a lecturer in media arts and science, and Andres Tovar, an associate professor of mechanical and energy engineering and an assistant professor of biomedical engineering, are co-authors and co-directors of this research project.  [Zebulun Wood](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/zeb-wood/)  “Our research and design algorithms show innovative, energy-absorbing cellular helmet liners,” Najmon said. “Cellular helmet liners are ideal for impact energy absorption, as their structures can mimic the excellent absorbing capabilities of foam and energy protective biological structures while maintaining the ability to be engineered for specific impact, dynamic responses.”  The two students were given the reins to experiment and explore different ways of making something that could be useful to people, DeHart said. “I took a more interpretative look at nature, mimicking functions and forms from nature, while Joel took a more scientific one, putting numbers into a program to get results.”  This work shows lessons learned from bio-inspired designs using protective structures such as pomelo peel, nautilus shell and woodpecker skull, Tovar said. “Our work explores a design approach to tailor the response of a cellular material subject to impact, an approach that offers the potential to mitigate head injury by decreasing acceleration, decreasing penetration and increasing specific energy absorption.”  “What this study really gets to is that nature, through millions of years of innovation and evolution, knows best,” Wood said. “We took some of nature’s hardest surfaces — surfaces that could be translated to helmet design — and re-created them in a way that can be simulated in engineering software.”  Nature may have provided inspiration for the cellular designs, but it took the students months to figure out how the bio-inspired shapes developed by DeHart could be re-created in a way that they could be used by Najmon in engineering simulation software that showed whether their helmet liner would reduce risk of injury.  The challenge the two students faced, Wood said, was to learn how to create geometric shapes that were inspired by nature but could also be simulated in engineering software. “Until our experiment, that was very difficult to do. It’s still difficult to do. Now IUPUI knows how to get those shapes to work together.”  The kind of collaboration that enabled the students to bridge the gap between the domains of media arts and science and engineering could only happen at a campus like IUPUI that encourages people in different fields to work together, Wood said.  The helmet liner study was supported by a grant from the Sports Innovation Institute at IUPUI .

    "body": "  ## Bolchini receives Google Faculty Research Award for accessible computing research  June 18, 2018  Davide Bolchini , associate professor and chair of the Department of Human-Centered Computing, recently received a prestigious 2017 Google Faculty Research Award to support his human-computer interaction research on novel navigation principles for entirely auditory keyboards.  [Davide Bolchini](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/davide-bolchini/)  Google Faculty Research Awards provide unrestricted gifts as support for research at institutions around the world. The Google Faculty Research Awards program aims to recognize and support world-class, permanent faculty pursuing cutting-edge research in areas of mutual interest. The award is highly competitive—only 15% of applicants receive funding—and each proposal goes through a rigorous Google-wide review process.  [Google Faculty Research Awards](https://ai.google/research/outreach/faculty-research-awards/)  This year, Google received 1033 proposals from 46 countries and over 360 universities. After expert reviews and committee discussions, Google funded 152 projects.  Bolchini, who is also director of the Human-Computer Interaction graduate program, will use the $51,827 award to further his research in accessible computing, especially focusing on theoretical foundations, design strategies, and technology prototypes that enable the blind and visually impaired to navigate auditory keyboards that do not rely on a reference screen for text entry.  [Human-Computer Interaction](https://luddy.iupui.edu/hcc/graduate/hci/)  The way mobile text entry currently works is very much screen-centric, says Bolchini, principal investigator on the project, and forces people who are blind and visually impaired to keep their phones out at all times, increasing the risk of the device being dropped or stolen. Moreover, screen-centric interaction requires a high level of fine-motor, two-hand manipulation, making it difficult to type with one hand while the other is busy with a cane or a guide dog.  “We are interested in understanding the fundamental language of ‘screenless’ interaction for typing and browsing, an approach that goes beyond voice or touch interfaces and can untether the blind from continuous attachment to a screen while fully leveraging their outstanding ability to listen to extremely fast text-to-speech,” Bolchini says. “I am excited to receive from Google such a prestigious recognition and support for the research in our lab. This award further enables faculty and students to pursue forward-looking research in partnership with community organizations.”     ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## MAS graduate says semester working for Microsoft Research Asia was ‘a little taste of heaven’  July 13, 2012  Joan Savage, who earned a master’s degree in media arts and science in May, spent the spring semester in Beijing, China, working with researcher Darren Edge at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA), in its Human-Computer Interaction group. Savage earned bachelor’s degrees in psychology and communications/electronic media, and served in the United States Navy during the Gulf War.  Born in Harvey, Ill., she grew up in Asia and Venezuela. In her “free time” she is a member of the American Legion Post 438 and was nominated as First Vice Commander. She volunteers with her post, her church and a local VA hospital whenever she can fit it in to her busy schedule. Her work at Microsoft included research and design of ways to improve the experiences of both presenters and audiences for a variety of presentation types. They worked on a range of media and technologies that support every stage of the presentation lifecycle, from brainstorming, composing and styling, to rehearsing, delivering and sharing. The following is a Q&A with Joan, who also blogged about her experiences, upon her return from the internship. (To read her blog, click here: https://luddy.iupui.edu/category/joan-savage/)  Q. What were your favorite things about working in Beijing?  A. Microsoft and all my fellow interns and researchers were the best part of Beijing. MSRA was a place filled with unique people and energy and life. Everybody is trying to be the next big thing and create the next big idea. Just being around them was contagious and extremely motivating! Suddenly, the most complicated tasks and challenging missions seem a reality! I am a better person having been exposed to that environment and those amazing people from all over the world. It was a little taste of heaven and it made Beijing so very worthwhile.  Q. What was your least favorite? Beijing is a land where things don’t operate according to my outline on life; an outline that clearly states if a person commits a negative action they should be the main recipient of the negative consequences. Newton’s law – to every action there is always an equal and opposite reaction. However, in China if a manager makes a mistake or is rude, the innocent receptionist suffers if I dare to complain about it. The poor are penalized for my protests. So I found myself a coward in Beijing. I couldn’t fight the fights of injustice for fear that the blameless receptionist will suffer again for my unhappiness when all liability clearly belongs to the manager. I can’t take a stand when I know the clerk who graciously helped me will be the one to shoulder all responsibility if I am unsatisfied. I have watched over and over again the wrong person suffer for my causes and complaints. Imagine a terribly rude manager who forces a barely involved innocent office worker to apologize to me when she had nothing to do with the rudeness! I hesitated to even complain – even when the complaint was very necessary – for fear someone undeserving would be left with the burden. I dared not get angry at any injustice for fear some kind old man who helped me would be someone else’s scapegoat. I resented that so much.  Q. Would you recommend an overseas internship like yours to other students? If so, what advice would you give them?  A. I would completely recommend it. In fact even declare, go after it – with all passion and endurance. If for nothing else than to come into the realization that you are not God’s gift to the world…and that there are no islands in Microsoft. We work as a team – sharing and shouldering burdens, responsibilities and praises. My advice would be to leave the attitude. They have little tolerance for it, and it will be better for all parties involved if you go with that baggage left at home.  Q: Do you hope to continue this type of work, or did this internship help you decide to go in another direction? A: I must admit I have always had a little crush on Microsoft. I mean – come on – they had me at “Halo.” But after this internship or “courtship, as my dad has referred to it, I fell deeply in love with Microsoft. Deeply. Including the field of research. I think I can safely say I am in it for the long haul.  Q: What are your plans now that you’re back at IUPUI? Earning a doctorate? Landing a job?  A: I am currently pursuing a job at the Roudebush VA Hospital in the research department, and am also waiting to hear if I was accepted into the Human-Computer Informatics Ph.D. program at the School of Informatics and Computing.  Q: What advice would you give undergraduates who are just starting their college career in an informatics-related field?  A: Hang tight and be prepared to have your mind blown at what you find you are capable of doing. Technology waits for no one and whether you are ready or not, it keeps moving forward. Blink and you might have missed your chance.  Q: Anything else you would like to add?  A: Enjoy your life. I realize sometimes you need to do what you need to do to survive, but life is short. So find ways to enjoy it and you will be surprised how quickly you find yourself – your future – in the midst of your joy.       ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## IU trustees approve merger of schools of informatics, library science  October 12, 2012  The Indiana University Board of Trustees has approved the merger of the university’s School of Informatics and Computing and School of Library and Information Science into a single school to be called the IU School of Informatics and Computing and Computing.    Indiana University School of Library and Information Science Dean Debora Shaw and School of Informatics and Computing and Computing Dean Bobby Schnabel said the merger would provide new and significant opportunities for expanding research and education.  The change will affect schools at both the Bloomington and IUPUI campuses and is being heralded by IU President Michael A. McRobbie and administrators at both schools as an opportunity to create a single school of expanded breadth, size and quality that addresses the rapid evolution of informatics, computing and libraries.  “The study of information and computation has become more closely linked and important than ever,” McRobbie said. “Combining these two high-quality, highly ranked schools will create a single unit that can compete more effectively with the best schools in the world in this area.  “The new school will also create excellent opportunities for new initiatives that are being pursued immediately, including a new cutting-edge program in big data science, an initiative in network science, strengthened collaborations and emphasis in health informatics, and the revitalization of IU’s leadership role in social informatics.”  Demand for trained professionals in computing and informatics is expected to continue, and the need for librarians and information professionals is shifting to graduates with skills in digital curation and preservation, e-science and user-systems interaction, emphasizing the importance of a strong technological base, McRobbie noted.  “By placing these programs in a combined culture where rapid change is expected to be the norm, IU is provided with an excellent opportunity to contribute in a broader sphere at the confluence of information and computing,” he said. “Deans (Bobby) Schnabel and (Debora) Shaw are to be congratulated on developing an excellent proposal after an extensive process of discussion and consideration, and in particular for obtaining such enthusiastic support of an overwhelming number of faculty.”  With the only school in the U.S., and most likely the world, that educates and conducts research in everything from computer science and cybersecurity to network science and large-scale data, the new school is expected to broaden perspectives that will ultimately benefit students, faculty and future users of information technology and libraries.  Informatics’ Schnabel and library and information science’s Shaw agreed that new and significant opportunities exist for expanding collaborations and for bringing new and expanded curricula to undergraduate and graduate students.  “A myriad of important current and emerging areas stand to benefit from the combined school’s expertise in information and computing, enhancing IU’s ability to offer undergraduate and graduate education and to conduct leading-edge research,” Schnabel said. “To date, these interactions have been primarily focused on research, but significant opportunities exist for expanding these collaborations to the benefit of all students.”  Increased interaction in the areas of big data science, health informatics, human computer interaction, media sciences, network science and social informatics is expected, Schnabel and Shaw said, and new initiatives are already being anticipated, including a new curricular emphasis in data science, a university-wide institute in network science, and a focus on expanding the Rob Kling Center for Social Informatics, already a joint venture between the two schools  “Merging the two schools helps address issues of the pace of change in information and communication technologies,” Shaw said. “It also helps prepare students in our graduate-level information and library science programs for careers that increasingly require technical skills and sophisticated understanding of the effective uses of technology.”  The School of Library and Information Science is consistently among the top 10 (seventh in the most recent rankings) in the U.S. News and World Report rankings, and an outside analysis of information and library science journals found IU second, behind Harvard University, in the impact of its publications. The Bloomington and IUPUI campuses combined have 455 graduate students and 26 faculty members this fall; the school does not have an undergraduate program.  The School of Informatics and Computing, the first of its kind in the country, was founded as a core school in 2000 and introduced the nation’s first Ph.D. in informatics. The school, which has 1,490 undergraduate students and 892 graduate students this fall at both campuses, is an international research leader in areas including bioinformatics, complex networks and systems, cyber-infrastructure, data and search, human-computer interaction, networks and systems, programming languages and security and privacy. It has 110 faculty members.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## HCI student deepens design thinking skills as Google intern  October 25, 2023  (photo provided by Sangeetha Parthasarathi)  Sangeetha Parthasarathi took a self-guided path to learn design and successfully built a portfolio that led her to work as a product designer in India for over a year. Throughout this journey, she discovered that design encompasses much more than aesthetics – it revolves around crafting a robust design strategy to ensure functionality and user satisfaction. This realization sparked her desire to pursue further academic growth in the field of design thinking, which led her to the decision of pursuing a Masters in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and this summer, to a UX Design internship at Google.  [Human-Computer Interaction](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/masters/hci/)  Parthasarathi, who will graduate in May, 2024, chose the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering at IUPUI for several compelling reasons. She was impressed by the diverse and cutting-edge courses offered, which catered to her passion for technology and human-centered design. Secondly, the school’s commitment to practical experience through internships and industry collaborations aligned perfectly with her goal of gaining hands-on experience in the field of HCI. “I valued the opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world projects, preparing me to thrive in the industry. Furthermore, the welcoming and inclusive community at Luddy stood out to me. The collaborative and supportive environment fostered a conducive learning atmosphere, which I believed would enhance my academic journey and personal growth,” Parthasarathi said.  She said her choice of HCI was a natural extension of her existing experience and interest in design. “I was drawn to HCI because it combines my passion for technology with my desire to improve user experiences. Pursuing HCI was a way for me to deepen my understanding of design thinking, user research, and usability evaluation, making me better equipped to create meaningful and user-centric products or services.”   ### Working with the Google Design System  Parthasarathi applied for her internship through the Google Careers website after she came across the opportunity by conducting a simple online search. She spent 12 weeks at Google HQ in San Francisco, working with cross-functional teams to breathe life into an innovation project, which included building a feature prioritization user survey to capture the user reaction; crafting low-mid fidelity wireframes to receive feedback from stakeholders and designers on the design direction; and, after many iterations and feedback cycles, arriving at a concept and feature development and crafting final UI mocks for the same.   #### Navigating through ambiguity  “Working with companies like Google, I often felt like there is so much learn, I almost felt like I was in space. Every time there was a creative block or if I was stuck in the weeds of the project, I was able to reach out collaborate,” she said. “Initially, I felt overwhelmed and intimidated, hesitating to reach out for feedback and collaboration. I struggled to showcase my work with conviction and would inadvertently talk down its value, undermining my efforts. However, as I progressed, I recognized the importance of valuing my skills and contributions.”  Parthasarathi says Luddy prepared her through a relentless focus on prioritizing users’ needs and desires and an application of Design Thinking principles, fostering innovative problem-solving and user-centric solutions. She also learned dedication to reducing cognitive load for users, creating intuitive interfaces that enhance usability.  She said Luddy also fostered her eagerness to ask questions fearlessly, promoting a deeper understanding of complex topics and facilitating continuous learning. She has had to demonstrate adaptability, quickly learning new tools and methodologies to tackle diverse design challenges effectively, and cultivate effective storytelling skills, allowing her to articulate design rationale and influence stakeholders with compelling narratives.   ### What’s next?  “When it comes to my future career plans, I approach them with a dynamic perspective. While I recognize the importance of setting goals, I also acknowledge that certain factors are beyond our complete control. Instead, I focus on becoming an exceptional designer with a diverse skill set and a passion for making a significant impact in the field.” Ultimately, Parthasarathi’s ambition is to leave a lasting impression through her work, leaving behind a legacy of groundbreaking designs that positively impact users and society as a whole.  Her advice to other would-be UX Designers is to stay curious. “Curiosity has been the driving force behind my passion for design, and I firmly believe that it is the key to staying motivated and inspired in this field.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "url": "URL: https://luddy.iupui.edu/careers/services/career-prep/interviewing.html#search",
    "body": "  ## Interviewing  The interview is your opportunity to convince the employer that you are the right person for the job. Your resume gets you the interview, but the interview gets you the job. Therefore, it is important for you to be able to articulate your past work experiences, accomplishments, and future career goals, all while demonstrating your professionalism, communication skills, personality, and confidence. Therefore, you must be comfortable with the idea of marketing yourself to an interviewer.  Interviews are generally conducted over the phone, by video, or in person. Before your interview, be sure to carefully review all available information about the company, reread the job posting, and prepare to answer questions about your goals, values, education, and experience.   ### Interview Steps   #### Preparing for the interview  For a successful interview experience, you must demonstrate both self-awareness (an understanding of your own skills, abilities, values, and qualifications) as well as awareness about the employer.   #### Self-Awareness  Start by taking a personal inventory and assess your skills, education, experience, and personal qualities. By recognizing your own values, interests, and skills, you will be able to determine whether a company or organization is a good fit for you. By doing a thorough self-assessment, you should be able to answer the following questions:  What are my career goals and objectives? What are my skills and abilities? How do they relate to the job for which I am interviewing? Where do I want to work and what types of positions interest me? What are my weaknesses? Am I prepared to address those weaknesses in an interview? What variables am I willing to negotiate (e.g., salary, geographic location)?   #### Employer Awareness  You must research the potential employer to be considered a conscientious candidate. The research will help you understand what skills and qualities the employer is looking for, and you will be able to anticipate what kinds of questions may be asked during the interview. Your research should include:   #### Resources to Find this Information Include:  [Glassdoor.com](https://www.glassdoor.com/)  [Firsthand](https://firsthand.co/)  Additionally, with Handshake Q&A (Question & Answer), students can ask career and employer related questions, and get answers from other students or alumni from any school on Handshake.   #### Interview Format  Most interviews fit a general pattern lasting approximately 30–45 minutes, and a typical structure is as follows:  During the discussion of your background and credentials, the interviewer will ask questions about your past experiences both within the classroom and in professional settings. Types of questions include:   #### Behavioral  In the past, how have you applied your skills in particular situations? (“Tell me about a time when…”)   #### Situational  How would you behave in a hypothetical future situation? (“What would you do if…”)   #### Technical  What is your technical knowledge? (“Design a code that does X…”)   #### Off-the-Wall (Not common)  How do you think outside the box? (“If you could be a superhero, what would you want your superpower to be?”)   #### STAR Technique  In preparing for the interview, you should identify examples of situations where you have demonstrated the behaviors a given company seeks. During the interview, focus on a particular situation, not a general one, which relates to the question at hand.  Describe the situation, explain what you did specifically, and articulate the positive result or outcome. Organize your response according to the STAR technique to answer the question effectively.   #### S – Situation  Describe the situation you were in by briefly providing context for your story. Last year, I served as the vice president for my student organization, and I was responsible for planning a charity fundraiser.   #### T – Task  Explain the task that you needed to accomplish. My goal for the event was to raise $3,000 for a specific non-profit.   #### A – Action  Describe the various actions you took (and why) that led to accomplishing the task. To maximize efficiency, I organized the volunteers into subcommittees and delegated assignments so that each group was responsible for reaching out to a different demographic of constituents (local businesses, alumni, faculty/staff, etc.)   #### R – Result  Explain the results that followed because of your actions and what did you learn. If you would do things differently in the future based on what you learned, tell them that. Due to the targeted approach to fundraising, we raised $3,750 and engaged the entire organization’s membership in participating in the fundraiser.  Bonus Tip: After completing the STAR technique, share how your example is relevant to the role you are applying for.   #### Possible Interview Questions   #### The Meaning Behind the Question  It is important to know that some employers ask questions that seem very simple. However, the meaning behind the questions may not be simple at all. (Adapted from the book Money Jobs.)  Tell me about yourself. How does your background qualify you for this job? Can you take an incredible amount of information, organize it quickly in your head, and present it in a concise and articulate fashion?  What are your greatest strengths and weaknesses? Are my perceptions of your strengths and weaknesses the same as yours? How mature are you in dealing with your weaknesses? Can you identify methods for self-improvement?  Where do you want to be in five years? What motivates you and what do you want out of life? Is this job merely a stepping stone to something better?  Why this job? Why this organization? Have you done your homework? Are you analytical?  How would your peers describe you? How do you see yourself? Are you a leader or a follower?  What makes you think you will succeed in this organization? Have you accurately identified the skills and expertise needed to succeed? Can you prove you have them?  Why should we hire you? What do you bring to this job? How are your promotion and persuasion skills? Are you believable? If you can’t sell yourself, how will you be able to sell our products/company/ideas?   #### Questions to Ask the Interviewer  Salary should not be discussed during the early stages of the interview process unless the employer introduces the topic. Before you interview, you should decide what your financial expectations and financial needs are and find out what the general salary range is for a similar position.   #### Tips for a Successful Interview   #### Dress for Success  Our appearance during an interview is very important. You never have a second chance to make a first impression. You should dress according to your own style and budget, but your clothes should be professional for in-person and virtual interviews.  Jeans, shorts, sundresses, or athletic wear are never appropriate. In general, clothes should be tailored, in good condition, and wrinkle and lint free.   #### Video Interviews  In addition to phone and in-person interviews, an increasing number of employers are utilizing online communication tools, such as Skype, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or Google Hangouts, to conduct “face-to-face” video interviews along with prerecorded interviews in which students record interview answers within a prescribed time frame. Although the medium is different, you should prepare for a video interview in the same way you prepare for an in-person interview—do your research, know the job description, prepare responses to interview questions, and have questions to ask the interviewer.  Follow these other tips to ensure you have a successful video interview.   #### Before the Interview   #### During the Interview   #### Interview Follow-up   #### Thank You Note  Following the interview, always send a thank you letter or email to the employer. Many candidates overlook this thoughtful step in the job search process. "

    "body": "  ## Informatics alumna mixes passion for racing with artistic career  May 23, 2012  Spend any time at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway this weekend and you will likely see the work of Informatics alumna Lauren Smith.  Smith, a 2009 graduate of the Media Arts and Science program, created one of the designs being used by Izod IndyCar this year for a new line of clothing.  “I’m part of the art department at Lids Team Sports, which is a division of Lids that provides custom jerseys, spirit wear, and uniforms to schools and organizations across the country,” Smith explained. “Lids was started right here in Indiana, and its corporate headquarters is just 15 minutes from where I grew up [in Zionsville].”  Smith says there are 21 people in the art department and the entire team is responsible for creating the artwork for various sports teams and organizations. But the Izod IndyCar project was extra special for Smith.  “I was particularly excited because racing has always been a part of my life,” she said. “My dad used to race cars, so when he was home, the television was always tuned to one or more races.”  She says the art department was given the freedom to develop more than 60 potential designs for Izod IndyCar. Once the designs were created, everything was critiqued and Izod narrowed it down to their favorite designs. Then production began.  “Right now, my t-shirt design (as well as others from my co-workers in the art department) is available to buy on the Izod Indycar website, as well as the Indianapolis Motor Speedway,” Smith said.  She had her photo taken with one of her t-shirts at Pole Day last week, and a family member also spotted the shirt at a track in Florida. “…so it’s all over the place!” she said.  Smith, who particularly enjoyed her digital storytelling classes as an undergrad, says her position at Lids was exactly what she was looking for in a career.  “I knew that I wanted to end up in a creative environment with creative people,” she said. “My biggest passion has always been illustration and I’m extremely lucky to have found a job that allows me to use my skills to create fun logos and designs that people will actually buy and wear. I’ve also learned quite a bit from my coworkers. It’s amazing how being surrounded with creative people will enhance your own creativity.”  Smith credits networking and keeping her skills sharp with helping her land the position at Lids.  “I was first told about the position at Lids Team Sports by a friend I had met at IUPUI, Jon Scott,” Smith said. “He had been working for a different part of Lids for a couple of years and spoke very highly about the company. In fact, he had put in a good word for another friend and former classmate, John Hazard, to work in the art department several months before. So when I went in to interview, I had the benefit of already having two good friends within the company who were putting in good words for me!”  In addition to networking, Smith advises recent college graduates to never give up in searching for that ideal job.  “Make friends and keep your eyes and ears open. It took me three years after graduating to find my way to Lids, and on the way I worked in call centers and legal offices to earn a living,” she explained. “In every job I had, I made a point to let my employers know what I could do, and they started giving me creative projects to work on. It was important for me to have that outlet while working the jobs I didn’t necessarily like, and it helped keep my skills sharp for when the opportunity at Lids did come up.”  As for her next big project, Smith says more designs are forthcoming.  “We’re constantly getting projects in addition to our regular workload, but these projects are still in the works, so I can’t tell you much more than that!”  To purchase a t-shirt featuring Smith’s design, visit: http://shop.indycar.com/style/Racing-Mens-Blur-T-Shirt/20396042   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Barbara Hayes releases new book exploring the use of health informatics to improve lives of patients with chronic illness  October 11, 2010  Barbara Hayes, M.S.W., M.S., associate dean for administration and planning at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, has released a new book that offers a uniquely patient-centered perspective on health informatics and its potential to improve the lives of those living with type 2 diabetes and other chronic illnesses. Hayes co-edited the book, published by MIT Press, with William Aspray, Ph.D., from the School of Information at University of Texas at Austin.  The book, titled “Health Informatics: A Patient-Centered Approach to Diabetes,” examines the changing information problems patients with diabetes encounter as they cope with progressive stages of the disease. Patients, healthcare providers, and computer and information scientists are all interested in using digital tools to ease the burden of chronic illness. The book addresses the unique challenges of utilizing information technology in the complicated healthcare milieu. It offers chapters on specific topics including ubiquitous computing, educational gaming, digital “coaches” that help with diet and exercise, electronic medical records, patient access to healthcare information and challenges in health IT research collaborations.  Hayes and Aspray focus on diabetes as a model for research and analysis because of the disease’s significant impact on U.S. healthcare systems. Diabetes is the country’s most prevalent chronic illness, diagnosed in over 20 million American adults; an estimated 57 million have pre-diabetes.  “Health Informatics: A Patient-Centered Approach to Diabetes” is available for purchase through a number or retail outlets, including Amazon.com and MIT Press.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Students’ “Essential Care for Every Baby” app wins at AMIA  December 13, 2019  The first 24 hours after birth can determine long-term health outcomes for at-risk babies. Graduate students from the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI and the Purdue School of Science at IUPUI helped develop a tool that could help babies, new mothers, and their caregivers as far as the other side of the world—and as close to home as Indiana.  Labor and delivery at most hospitals is a busy place, and the nurses that care for the newest members of society have to be especially vigilant during the first day, making sure nothing is overlooked. Vitals must be monitored and a baby’s status needs to be updated and communicated multiple times a day. Recently, the team of Kevin Horan (Computer Science), Radhika Ravindran (Human-Centered Computing), and Anushri Singh Rajapuri (BioHealth Informatics)—pictured above with BioHealth Informatics faculty Dr. Saptarshi Purkayastha and IU School of Medicine researcher Dr. Sherri Bucher—answered a challenge from the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) to design a digital solution to support the decision-making of health care providers in any area of medicine.  At the 2019 AMIA Conference on November 19, Rajapuri presented the team’s app, Essential Care for Every Baby: Neonatal Clinical Decision Support Tool, which garnered the team a first place in the AMIA Design Challenge.  According to the team’s proposal, every year, globally, there are 2.5 million stillbirths and 2.7 million neonatal deaths during the first month of life.  Low- and middle-income settings, particularly within sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, bear the highest burden for this newborn mortality. The great tragedy of these deaths is that most are preventable.  To address this urgent global health challenge, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and key global development partners have deployed a suite of interrelated maternal and newborn educational and training programs called Helping Mothers Survive and Helping Babies Survive. These initiatives have been specifically designed to equip health care providers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) with the knowledge, skills, and competencies to provide evidence-based, life saving care to mothers and babies during labor, delivery, and the first month after birth.  Essential Care for Every Baby (ECEB), part of the Helping Babies Survive series, is designed to equip health providers in LMICs with the ability to prevent, recognize, and manage common newborn complications from birth through the first 24 hours postnatal, or until discharge from a health facility after delivery. However, key challenges, barriers, and bottlenecks threaten the sustainability of this program at scale. In particular, perennial challenges in LMICs, including understaffing and extremely high nurse-to-patient ratios, deleteriously impact the ability of healthcare providers to adequately monitor, track, and provide integrated essential newborn care interventions to mother-baby pairs under their care.  “Despair, grief, and helplessness are the three words that resonate with the statistics on the number of children that die in the first month and first 24 hours of life.”  Due to a lack of specialists, including physicians in these settings, nurses provide the vast bulk of care—around the time of labor, delivery, and the postnatal period—to mothers and babies. This, in turn, results in significant cognitive load for nurses, who struggle to perform varied tasks every few minutes for each baby under their care. Finally, in many settings, where newborn death is frequent and there is a feeling of “learned helplessness” in prevention of newborn mortality, healthcare providers often feel social and cultural pressure to attend to potential maternal complications more urgently. In this high-load situation, although mothers might receive some care, the ‘voiceless’ baby is sometimes ignored.  The team explained, “The digital tool we have designed is built to tackle these complex challenges. It has been purposely designed to deliberately and thoughtfully reduce cognitive load among healthcare providers who provide essential care for every newborn in overcrowded, high-pressure clinical care environments.” Built with open-source methods, the ECEB Digital Action Plan is an innovative, scalable, clinical-decision-support mobile app that incorporates key educational, training, and evidence-based methodology from the paper-based ECEB curriculum, but prioritizes recognition over recall and addresses the many barriers encountered by healthcare providers who deliver maternal-newborn care to mothers and babies on a daily basis in LMICs.  “Winning this highly reputable and competitive design challenge is a testament to the interdisciplinary spirit of my lab, school, and campus. The team included students and faculty from the departments of Human-Centered Computing, BioHealth Informatics, Computer Science, and the School of Medicine. Without this interdisciplinary collaboration, solving complex problems is nearly impossible,” Purkayastha said.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Media Arts and Science Faculty Receives New Frontiers Grant for AMPATH Project  March 31, 2015  An Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing faculty member at IUPUI has been awarded a $44,000 Indiana University New Frontiers grant to produce a series of short films addressing issues of HIV stigma that will be shot in Kenya involving MOI University faculty and students.  “Derived from real-life scenarios of HIV-infected youths, these films will empower and support those with HIV by generating empathy, fostering understanding and confronting community stereotypes and false beliefs,” said Thomas Lewis, a Media Arts and Science lecturer. “The films will be used in AMPATH counseling and support groups, but they will find a larger social impact with screenings in schools and churches throughout Kenya and other Sub-Saharan countries.”  According to Lewis, ethnographic filmmakers have long sought to directly involve the film’s subject and surrounding community in the telling of their own stories. The resulting films–far richer, accurate and culturally aware than otherwise possible– are products of relinquished control over film direction and a creative process guided by diverse perspectives and opinions.  This project seeks to use these participatory techniques, but for the creation of narrative films that engage with the issues of HIV stigma as they pertain to youth and African audiences, Lewis said. “This is a novel approach to the creation of narrative films.”  An advisory team will direct the project. Team members include Lewis; co-principal investigator Jeanette Dickerson-Putman, IU School of Liberal Arts; Christopher Odhiambo, Moi University; Rachel Vreeman, Indiana University School of Medicine, and selected HIV+ youth.  Students from the Media Arts and Science program have the opportunity to be part of the pre and post production crew through Independent Study, writing stories and editing films. They also have the opportunity to work with faculty and students from Moi University in Kenya to develop the stories.  Currently, Lewis and his local team conduct regular meetings with their partners in Kenya via Skype, during which they are refining the logistics of their international collaboration and formulating the stories to be developed into scripts. This summer Lewis and his team will spend 5 weeks in Eldoret shooting the resulting scripts. Upon their return they will enlist Tyler Sapp, a Media Arts and Science student, to assist in editing a portion of the seven films as part of his Capstone experience fall 2015.  With the New Frontiers grant, Lewis will continue work he began in January of 2012 when he received an IU International Development Fund Grant to launch a collaborative partnership with the Kenya-based HIV pediatric research program of the Department in Pediatrics at the Indiana University School of Medicine. Lewis spent 10 days in Eldoret, Kenya working with local crew and actors to produce eight short videos that addressed issues around disclosure of HIV status to children.  IU’s Frontiers in the Arts and Humanities funding helps IU faculty members by supporting the initial stages of path-breaking and transformative programs of scholarly investigation or creative activity.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

McRobbie awarded one of the first four grants from IU’s President’s International Research Awards to Professor Steven Mannheimer, associate dean of faculty affairs and professor in the Media Arts and Science program at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI.  Read the IUPUI news release.  The new program sponsors international collaborative research projects that engage one or more of IU’s Global Gateways and the communities they serve. Mannheimer received the grant for his partnership with the Indian Institute of Technology-Delhi.  “This grant from the P.I.R.A. program is a great honor, and allows to build on years of research and civic engagement at the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI with the blind and visually impaired community of Indiana—and more recently with collaborators in India,” said Mannheimer.  Mannheimer will work with teachers and students from two schools for the blind—one in India and one in Indiana—to develop and test new tactile and audio graphic strategies that better align with the ways that blind and visually impaired students experience the world, with the goal of enhancing their classroom learning.  Mannheimer’s teacher and student workshops incorporate his original concept of “audemes”—meaningful units of sound, such as the jingle of keys or clicks on a keyboard—which are used to enhance blind and visually impaired students’ aural memory of subjects.  The work is part of the Accessible Careers through Technology (ACT) initiative in the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, which presents new avenues for workforce development for the blind and visually impaired that include educational enhancement and assistive technologies in the workplace.  “Over the past year, thanks to the support of the IU India Gateway, we have established collegial partnerships with researchers in India, and are working with them to develop an exciting exploration of innovative design strategies for tactile graphics, which are used internationally in schools for the blind,” said Mannheimer. “This has been a team effort here at the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, involving several faculty and grad students over the years.”  “We are grateful for the chance to expand the scope of our research and service.”     ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## First Wilma Gibbs Moore Graduate Endowed Scholarship recipient seeks MLIS  January 8, 2019  In 2018, the Department of Library and Information Science at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI established and sought funding for the Wilma Gibbs Moore Graduate Endowed Scholarship, honoring IU alumna Wilma L. Moore of Indianapolis. Olivia MacIsaac is the first recipient of the scholarship, and is enrolled in the Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS) degree program at IUPUI.  MacIsaac holds a B.A. in Art History from the Herron School of Art and Design, a certificate in Museum Studies, and a minor in Classical Studies from the IU School of Liberal Arts. While an undergraduate she was a Diversity Scholar, a peer advisor, a research assistant, and a service learning assistant. Currently, she is a scholarly communication associate at Butler University Libraries.  She points to several people who inspired her to enter the field. Modupe Labode, associate professor of history at IUPUI first suggested that she apply for the diversity scholar position. Caitlin Pollock, digital humanities librarian at IUPUI University Library was an early mentor on a multidisciplinary digital mapping project. “Caitlin and Modupe were two of the first WOC I had the pleasure of working with at IUPUI within the classroom setting and within IUPUI’s University Library. Without their continued presence and mentorship, I would not have excelled in the same way as I did as an undergraduate student and budding professional,” MacIsaac says.  MacIsaac decided to pursue her MLIS degree with the aim of becoming a public scholar in libraries and information science and developing best practices and standards for sustainable digital preservation within libraries and archives. “I am continuing to figure out what I love most about libraries, but so far I like that there’s always a potential to change and to do more—nothing seems stagnant,” she says.  The Wilma Gibbs Moore Graduate Endowed Scholarship has opened doors for MacIsaac and allowed her to work toward her goal of becoming a librarian or archivist, and she is thankful for those who started and contributed to it. “There were a number of barriers preventing me from pursuing the MLIS on my own,” MacIsaac says. “(The scholarship) helped me tear down what was blocking my path and allowed me to focus my time on my academic success within the program.”  MacIsaac is also grateful to faculty in the MLIS program who have already had an impact on her—especially Mahasin Martinson, Kisha Tandy, and the Chair of the Department of Library and Information Science, Andrea Copeland. “I’m excited for the challenges to come as I pursue an MLIS degree and I can’t wait to make an impact in the field,” she says.   ### About Wilma Gibbs Moore  The Wilma Gibbs Moore Graduate Endowed Scholarship memorializes Moore, whose contributions to the historical record of African Americans in Indiana are well documented.  Wilma Gibbs Moore graduated from Crispus Attucks High School and received her B.S. in sociology and her master’s in library science degree from Indiana University. She worked at Indiana University Libraries and the Indianapolis Public Library, and retired from the Indiana Historical Society after 30 years.  Moore served as editor of Black History News & Notes, and was contributing editor of Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History. She received the Award of Merit from the American Association for State and Local History and the Eli Lilly Lifetime Achievement Award for her contributions in the field of history.  She participated in a number of local organizations serving the Indianapolis community, among them the Indiana African American Genealogy Group, Indiana Freedom Trails, the Association for the Study of African American Life and History, the Indiana Landmarks’ African American Landmarks Committee, the Neal-Marshall Black Culture Center at Indiana University, and Crispus Attucks High School and Museum.

But what does the general public really understand about all the various applications of AI that are currently in use, and in fact, have been for quite some time? Much of this development is taking place right here at our IU Indianapolis campus.  According to a survey of over 11K adults conducted by the Pew Research Center , only 30 percent recognized examples of such embedded AI applications currently in their hands: music playlist recommenders, wearable fitness trackers, web-based chatbots, and email spam detectors, to name a few. And 44 percent didn’t even realize they had interacted with AI at all.

    "body": "  ## Informatics student uses hobby to give back to sick children  January 22, 2015  Josh Hansen, an Informatics undergrad at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, has always had an interest in technology. A native of Nebraska, he came to IUPUI from California where he was a member of the United States Airforce and decided to use the GI Bill to get his degree.  Engineering was what he initially considered for his career, but chose Informatics because he likes the broad range of technology it encompasses and the variety of industries in which you can work.  In addition to his interest in technology, Josh has a hobby of costume making and cosplay; Indiana Jones and Aqua Man are just a sample of some of the costumes he has created. Ironman, his most recent, took five months to complete.  Josh considered costume making an outlet for his creativity, until he received some big attention from attendees at a gaming convention. He then began looking into how he might be able to put smiles on the faces of those more in need.  “When I received such a great response, I thought wow, this might be an opportunity and that’s when I started looking into how I could visit sick children and their families as a way to lift their spirits, and brighten their day,” said Josh. He started on his mission to see how he might be able to visit children’s hospitals in the area and began reaching out, trying to connect with someone that would provide an opportunity for him to visit and foster his mission.  Josh eventually heard back from the Peyton Manning Children’s  Hospital. “I know this sounds corny, but I kinda felt like a super hero being called to serve. I suited up and off I went. It is a bitter sweet feeling, seeing the smiles was rewarding, but knowing the children are really sick brought me back to reality. I am just glad that I could make them smile.”  Josh is working on a predator costume for his next project. He also is planning to graduate with a BS in Informatics May 2016, and hopes to secure a position where he can blend technology with his creativity.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

In addition to her bachelor’s degree, which she will earn this spring—and her master’s degree which she is on track to complete in 2024—she is completing a minor in cybersecurity through the Purdue School of Science at IUPUI.  [Accelerated Degree program with a B.S. in Informatics plus a Master’s in Jurisprudence](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/undergraduate/informatics/jurisprudence/)  Brooks has also achieved some personal firsts as she starts her summer internship with Chevron in Houston the day after graduation. She will be assisting in cybersecurity, incidence response, compliance and risk, and data privacy, while educating system users.  In fall 2022, Brooks attended the Grace Hopper Celebration, an annual tech conference aimed at women. During that time, she was able to interview with several companies seeking interns. “Originally, I was skeptical because I didn’t want to go out of state, but a friend persuaded me to sign up. I was nervous at the interview but then I got an offer,” Brooks said. She had another offer around the same time, with a food service company in Chicago, but ended up choosing Chevron and pushing herself out of her comfort zone.  Brooks graduated from Providence Christo Rey High School where she was active in the Luddy-sponsored Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce (iDEW) program and was information technology intern at Eli Lilly. It was through iDEW that she met Jim Lyst, Vicki Daugherty, and Tina Rice who encouraged her interest in both technology and law. At Luddy IUPUI, she has been a student ambassador for three years—and the first diversity outreach ambassador, a position created at her request this year—as well as a participant in IUPUI Regatta and a member of the school’s DEI Working Group.  [Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce (iDEW)](https://luddy.iupui.edu/idew/)  Her advice to others is to align purpose with passion. “Although it can be overwhelming, find the right opportunity by knowing yourself and your boundaries. Stay focused, stay involved, and have fun while making an impact. Life is trial and error, don’t be scared to try new things, to make the impossible, possible. The worst that can happen is a no,” Brooks said.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Animation students continue effort to address ocean pollution with “Sea Creatures Congress”  March 2, 2022  In fall 2020, members of the NEWM-N441 3D Team Production class taught by Media Arts and Science (MAS) faculty Albert William and Zebulun Wood built a 3-minute animation of a sea turtle, Mr. Bubbles , based on Herminia Din’s book, “Our Plastic Ocean, Our Clean Ocean.” Din is an artist/author at the University of Alaska-Anchorage, currently living in Taipei, and wrote the book to raise awareness of plastic pollution in the oceans.  [Albert William](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/albert-william/)  [Zebulun Wood](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/zeb-wood/)  [Mr. Bubbles](https://luddy.iupui.edu/news/story/students-3d-animation-plastic-pollution)  This was an international collaboration led by Dr. Darrell Bailey, with music created in Sweden by Erland Hiland, story by Despina Mosidou, and screenplay by Larry McCollough.  Recently, a new team of students in the same course elaborated on the theme and created the next chapter of the story, titled “ Sea Creatures Congress .” There will eventually be at least one more installment to complete the book’s narrative, according to William, with all the same collaborators. “This was a unique and extraordinary opportunity for students to collaborate with international partners to address a significant environmental issue. Zeb and I are extremely proud of how the team met all of the challenges in a short time frame to produce an outstanding piece of animation,” William said.  [Sea Creatures Congress](https://vimeo.com/658687261/1e5cd96c85)   ### The story, and the animation, continues  Sea Creatures Congress once again stars sea turtle Mr. Bubbles, who now has several aquatic friends helping him battle the ever-growing plastic pollution of the ocean.  Jacob Bridenthal, Virginia Hooten, Aaron Keilman, Jacob Moffitt, Kendall Riley, and Alexander Young were members of the development team for this second film.  Young and Bridenthal, both Media Arts and Science students specializing in 3D Graphics and Animation, were the designated pre-production duo, responsible with determining the layout of the sets and how the heroes, Speckled Maya and Mr. Bubbles, would journey through them to reach their destination at Gull’s Inlet. Beyond their initial iterations, the pair moved on to incorporating assets as they were being created, then used those revisions to continue ideating on their vision for the film as a regular progress presentation for their team-members and professors. This process continued most of the way through production, and even as the team was tying up loose ends in animation and texturing, there were still camera and shot-composition changes for Young and Bridenthal to make that would enhance the final product.  Throughout all that, Bridenthal helped with modeling many of their trash-berg assets, unwrapping models for texturing, applying Riley’s toon-shaders and look-development tools and validating they all worked correctly and consistently in scenes, animating heroes and background characters through all of scenes one and three, set-dressing scenes one and three, and rallying the team’s efforts for rendering in the last couple weeks.   ### Team work makes the dream work  Bridenthal explained that everyone bore some responsibility for many aspects of the project at some point or another. “In terms of personal highlights, it was pretty difficult to contain my excitement and concern for my non-conventional use of XGEN to populate scene one with trash,” he said. “It was thrilling to get it to work the way I wanted, but the road to get there was rocky. Producing the film was an exerting endeavor for us, and I’m very glad we made it out the other end intact! This experience was a great way to crack the shell of solo-work and learn the ropes of working on a production team.  “It’s a caliber of intensity and difficulty that I hadn’t encountered yet with group work, and I feel it really pushed us all to make sure we were doing our most in terms of collaboration and coordination. I’m excited for where it’s already taken me, and I’m looking forward to my next opportunity to tackle a project as impactful as this one!”  Young added, “The highlight of my experience was getting to work with a great group of other talented students to create the short film. It was a great learning experience from beginning to end.”  Bridenthal, a senior, is currently working a capstone internship at Aero Industries, Inc., a manufacturing company in southern Indianapolis, where he is taking on niche projects for their industry as a Media and Marketing Intern, and will be traveling with IUPUI’s Service Learning Project to Greece, where he’ll be working on multi-media projects to document cultural artifacts, historic locations, and the local traditions of the people of Paros. He hopes to work as a CAD drafter and 3D Environmental Artist following graduation and eventually end up at a major production studio like Industrial Light and Magic.  Young, who is a junior, is preparing for capstone next fall and after graduation wants to work in the animation industry as a storyboarder or character designer.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## First cohorts of iDEW students graduate college: Where are they now?  June 16, 2022  The IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI class of 2022 was 423 members strong; several of those graduating began their journey in the Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce (iDEW) program over the last seven years.  As of 2021, 563 students—from eight Indianapolis area high schools—had embarked on their post-secondary journey in 19 states; 14 enrolled at 7 HBCUs. And 20 had graduated from two- or four-year programs, with two enrolled in master’s programs. Seventy percent majored in a STEM subject.  iDEW is a pipeline from high school to workforce initiative designed to encourage and support underserved youth in developing skills for an IT career. Certifications, field trips, mentoring, workshops, and internships in preparation for the workforce and/or degree programs are part of the wraparound support to the curriculum. Those attending IUPUI or Ivy Tech also qualified for the Learning Informatics for Tomorrow (LiFT) scholarships funded through an NSF S-STEM grant awarded to Mathew Palakal, Ph.D., senior executive associate dean of the School of Informatics and Computing and leader of the iDEW program.  Following is a sampling of former iDEW students and where they are now.   ### Rebekah Holcomb  A 2018 graduate of Pike High School, Rebekah Holcomb participated in the iDEW program starting her junior year. That summer she interned at Eli Lilly and Co, working with their databases. “I learned a lot about professionalism in the office. Coming from high school directly into a business casual office was different and hard. Everyone was older and more mature than me, so I felt like I had a lot to make up and I couldn’t just be a high school student. Thanks to that, I’m a lot more professional and charismatic in the tech field. I learned how to be myself, while still being professional,” Holcomb said.    When I was a student in IDEW I learned how to code, build a robot, and even work in a team. Overall, it was through the bonds that I built and the skills that I learned that helped me find out that college was for me.  Holcomb went on to major in Informatics as a LiFT Scholar at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI and graduated May of this year. During her time at SoIC, she was selected as a summer Techpoint XTern working at Techpoint. “I did a lot at TechPoint from planning events, to taking attendance and even visualizing data. It was in my TechPoint internship that I truly learned about having a love for a job,” she said. “They made me feel right at home and my love for Indiana grew as well. It didn’t just show in the numbers, but also the events that they planned and how well they interacted with their Xterns.”  She also had high praise for the SoIC and iDEW staff during her time at Pike, IUPUI, and Techpoint including Vicki Daugherty, Tina Rice, Merillat Flowers, Le’Joy White, and Molly Morin.  “Vicki encouraged me to do my best and was always a listening ear,” Holcomb said. “Tina was the one who introduced me to so many opportunities. She reminded me of when I needed to do things and she understood when I tried to spread myself thin and do some things that I couldn’t. She was basically my voice of reason.  “Merillat was my supervisor at TechPoint. She taught me that my way of working was putting a strain on me and that I needed to be able to prioritize my work. Le’Joy was always flexible and understanding whenever my schedule was way too much. She taught me that it was okay to fail and that other people’s expectations of me shouldn’t come before my health. Molly taught me how to navigate being a woman of color in a predominately non-folk of color field. We were both first generation students who supported their families. It meant a lot when she saw something in me and when she gave me an open ear to vent. It was her enthusiasm….that kept me in college and going when I started to feel that it wasn’t for me.”  Holcomb will be working at Celigo, Inc. an IT service management company, following graduation.   ### Karen and Katherine Barrientos Moreno  Pike High School graduates Katherine and Karen Barrientos Moreno have UX internships this summer; Karen is at Oracle and Katherine is at 3M. They are both attending Purdue University.   ### Tyler Bowling  Bowling is a graduate of Arsenal Technical High School in 2018 and Purdue University in 2022, with a BS in Computer Information Technology. He now works as an Operations Engineer at ReliaQuest.   ### Emerald Evans  Evans graduated from Arsenal Technical High School in 2016 and Purdue University in 2020, with a B.A. in Law and Society. She is currently enrolled at the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law.   ### Patience Korrie  Korrie is also an Arsenal Technical High School graduate and received her B.S. in Applied Science from Taylor University in 2021. She is employed as a full-stack (web) developer at Infosys.   ### Isabel Lopez  Lopez graduated from Providence Cristo Rey High School in 2018 and completed her B.S. in Informatics at IUPUI in 2022. While at the School of  Informatics and Computing, she was selected as an I3 Researcher, iSchool Inclusion Institute (I3) in 2019. Lopez has accepted a position as a Business Intelligence and Data Analyst at General Motors.   ### Oscar Aca Saucedo  Saucedo is a graduate of Pike High School and received his B.S. in Computer Engineering from IUPUI in 2021. He is employed as a Software Development Engineer in Test at Moser Consulting and is pursuing an M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering.     ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

There are other types of visas that grant work authorization; for example, H1B, O, TN, etc.  Questions? Contact Julie Seman at jseman@iu.edu   ##### Curricular Practical Training (CPT)  Work authorization that allows international students with F-1 status to accept practical training in their academic field. Internship programs are some of the most common types of CPT opportunities for international students.  Duration: There is no limit, but 12 months of full-time CPT eliminates eligibility for OPT. Part-time CPT employment does not affect eligibility for OPT.  Hours: Students can either work part-time (20 hours or less/week) or full-time (more than 20 hours/week). The employer decides the student’s hours. Employer Role:   Must give the student an offer of employment. Applying for CPT work authorization is the student’s responsibility, and no action is required on the part of the employer.  Cost: There is no cost to the employer.   ##### Optional Practical Training (OPT)  Post-completion work authorization that allows international students with F-1 status and who have graduated to gain practical work experience related to their major field of study. This can also be done before completing their degree program.  Duration: 12 months  Employer Role: Applying for OPT work authorization is the student’s responsibility, and no action is required on the part of the employer. OPT can be approved with or without an offer of employment.  Hours: Students can either work part-time (Less than 20 hours/week) or full-time (20 hours or more/week). The employer decides the student’s hours.  Cost: There is no cost to the employer   ##### STEM OPT Extension  An additional 24 months (about 2 years) of OPT work authorization (for a total of 36 months) allowing international student with F-1 status and who have graduated with an approved degree in Science, Technology, Engineering or Math (STEM) to gain extra practical work experience.   ##### Hiring international students with F-1 status  Do not let fear of the visa process prevent you from hiring the best and brightest international graduates available. U.S. law provides several ways for employers to hire foreign graduates of U.S. universities.   ##### Frequently Asked Questions  We do not currently sponsor employees or file for future work visas. Can I still hire an international student with F-1 status?  Yes! CPT and OPT work authorization does not require sponsorship from an employer to apply; only a job offer.  How much must the employer pay to hire an international student with F-1 status for Curricular Practical Training (CPT) or Optional Practical Training (OPT)?  There is no cost to the employer. Students pay the application fee to receive their work authorization.  How much paperwork does the employer need to fill out to hire an international student with F-1 status?  Very little! All paperwork is handled by the student, the school, and the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The employer must fill out the usual hiring paperwork (Example: I-9, etc.)  How long can an international student with F-1 status work for an employer?  For CPT, it can vary but typically work authorization is granted on a semester basis.  For OPT, international students with F-1 status are granted 12-months of work authorization to work in their major field of study post-graduation.  For the STEM OPT Extension, certain international students with F-1 status are granted an additional 24-months of work authorization post-graduation. The employer must participate in the E-Verify system for the student to file for their STEM OPT Extension.  What about taxes?  International students with F-1 status earning income while working on practical training are subject to applicable federal, state, and local income taxes. Generally, international students with F-1 status are exempt from Social Security and Medicare tax requirements.   ### 2022 Recruiting Highlights  84% Undergraduate degree earners were employed in Indiana  68% Graduate degree earners were employed in Indiana  40% Degree earners were ethnically diverse  $15 Median internship pay for undergraduate students  $25 Median internship pay for graduate students "

    "body": "  ## iDEW virtual summer program receives $10K grant from Donaldson Foundation  May 29, 2020  The Donaldson Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Donaldson Filtration Solutions, recently awarded a $10K grant to the IU School of Informatics and Computing (SoIC) at IUPUI’s Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce (iDEW) program. The iDEW Summer Program will support students’ participation in the school’s summer technology workshops and trainings, which are being held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Planned online activities include Scrum training/project management certification, Code Black Indy-Salesforce project build-out training, Black Data Processing Associates (BDPA)-iDEW mentorship, and a customized Speaking College, as well as a virtual workshop in Game and Creature Design taught by SoIC faculty.  Programs will be presented through a virtual platform. In addition to the IT skills learned via the workshops, these students will be guided by trained student mentors, who will encourage and support them along the way.  The award-winning iDEW program is now finishing its fifth year of providing free computing by design (CxD) support and instruction to eight area high schools—Pike, Providence Cristo Rey, Arsenal Technical, Herron, George Washington, Riverside, McKenzie Center for Innovation and Technology, and Southport—and has reached more than 1680 students through its curriculum. To date, 492 students have graduated from the iDEW program and over 90% of them are now attending college; 80% percent in STEM-related majors.  [award-winning iDEW program](https://luddy.iupui.edu/idew/)  In addition to completing learning modules in robotics, internet of things (IoT), trivia apps, chatbots (AI), video game design, and data visualization, iDEW students are offered internship opportunities, visit IT industries, receive SAT prep assistance, and attend summer workshops and national IT conferences. Beyond building coding skills, students develop confidence and learn teamwork and communication.  “We have grown the iDEW program in size and scope over the last four and half years,” said Mathew J. Palakal, senior executive associate dean of the School of Informatics and Computing and iDEW program director. “The grant from the Donaldson Foundation gives us needed resources to fund this unique opportunity to benefit underserved youth in the Indianapolis community during the summer months as well.”  Established in 1966, the Donaldson Foundation has funded charitable causes on behalf of Donaldson Company, Inc.  The Foundation’s mission is to positively impact the communities in which Donaldson Company employees live and work by supporting education. The company has manufacturing or distribution in Anderson, Frankfort, and Rensselaer, Indiana.  “We are excited and honored to contribute to the success of the iDEW program,” said Chini Zeman, Donaldson Foundation board member. “Donaldson has a strong footprint in the greater Indianapolis community and this program allows us to help support our community while aligning perfectly with our core charter of supporting educational opportunities for those who otherwise may not have them.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Professor Holden wins Applied Ergonomics 2015 Best Paper Award  February 22, 2016  The Applied Ergonomics journal awarded its 2015 Best Paper prize to IU School of Informatics and Computing Professor Richard Holden for “Interruptions in the wild: Development of a sociotechnical systems model of interruptions in the emergency department through a systematic review,” which provides the most comprehensive model of interruptions in ER settings.  Read the Virtual Special Issue.  Co-authored by Holden’s former student Nicole E. Werner, assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin, the paper reviews and synthesizes 15 international studies that assess ER interruptions, responding to gaps in the previous literature that had looked at only the number and frequency of interruptions in an environment that is notoriously fast-paced, complex, and chaotic—where doctors and nurses face a spectrum of interruptions that can put patients’ safety at risk.  “There were too many reductionist views of interruptions that didn’t match what happens in ER settings, such as in trauma resuscitation,” Holden says. “No one had put these pieces together.”  Taking into account a wider range of factors—the cause of interruptions and how they unfold, the influence of team dynamics, types of tasks, technology, settings, “stacked” or multiple interruptions, and organizational systems—the model will serve as a gold standard in health informatics systems reviews and in further explorations of how the multilayered nature of ER interruptions may contribute to doctors’ and nurses’ loss of situation awareness, decreased critical thinking, stress, and error rates.  The award will be presented at the CIEHF Awards Ceremony at the Ergonomics and Human Factors Conference to be held in Daventry, UK, on April 20.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Media Arts and Science Student Creates “Shake It Off” Video for Fun and a Cause  October 14, 2014  IUPUI students are dancing in a music video to Taylor Swift’s song “Shake It Off.” But they are doing more than dancing to the catchy beat. They are raising awareness about a social issue and challenging other college students to do the same.  [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyN9jXCk0fM&list=UU9pzO_q2bFStJHD1LYhutlw)    The video was created by an IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI freshman student Jacob Harris, who was inspired by videos of others dancing to Swift’s song. Harris is pursuing a Media Arts and Science degree.  [Media Arts and Science](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/undergraduate/media-arts/)  “I saw the videos and kind of brainstormed a little bit,” Harris said. “I thought it would be really cool to do and to do it for a great cause.”  He settled on raising awareness about suicide prevention. In a message posted with the video, Harris provides the Web address for a suicide prevention website and a telephone number. He wrote, “If you are having thoughts of suicide, there is always help…You are loved and you are important no matter what. And if you still don’t think you are, you’re wrong. There are so many great things about life still ahead for you.”  Harris also challenged students at Indiana University Bloomington, Purdue University and Wabash College to produce their own “Shake It Off” video. He urged them to choose their own cause about which they could raise awareness.  Using University Library at IUPUI as a backdrop, Harris set up a video camera on a tripod. With the help of a roommate and two signs, Harris asked students as they passed the camera if they would dance for a few seconds in the video.  He had a box with an assortment of props, including wigs of various colors, a clown nose, a magic wand, a lime-green traffic vest, sunglasses and a pirate hat that dancers could wear, if they wished.  The fledging filmmaker learned that it is harder than one might think to get people to be in a video.  “About 80 percent of the students walking by wanted nothing to do with the video,” he said. “We had to beg some to do it. Some people wouldn’t dance alone on camera, so my roommate and I danced with them,” he said.  Two and a-half hours later, after a second shoot at the Campus Center and a little editing, the video was done.  “It was fun to do and it would be so cool if it could help save a life,” Harris said.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

This course emphasizes the development of basic skills that will allow you to create webpages and to combine these pages into functional websites. After several weeks of working on your technical skills, you will be making valid, accessible, and usable websites that are viewable on all devices. This course requires that you develop a proficiency in both technical skills as well as conceptual skills. The future of information delivery is through a screen of some sort, whether it be a desktop monitor, a tablet, a smartphone, or any other device. You need to know how the users receive that information and what must be done to accommodate them. You may never enter a career where you actually create websites, but if you plan to be an information professional of any type you will certainly assist in developing, judging, acquiring, accepting, promoting, and rejecting information delivered by a web-enabled device of some sort. Learning and employing this technology will be situated in group work done collaboratively at a distance across time zones and cultures. Outcomes will include both technical skills along with the ability to establish shared goals with collaborators across cultures and produce an artifact that addresses an information need that this distance collaboration team has identified.

    "body": "  ## IUPUI Announces New Degree in Informatics  March 4, 2015  The Indiana University Board of Trustees has approved a proposal for a new degree at IUPUI that provides a path for students to transition rapidly into in-demand and well-paid information technology jobs.    IUPUI will ask the Indiana Commission for Higher Education for final approval to offer the degree beginning in the fall.  “This program amongst others is the latest example of IUPUI’s tradition of developing distinctive programs that respond to student demand and meet employer needs,” said IUPUI Executive Vice Chancellor Nasser Paydar.  The new program is a master’s degree offered by the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI. The proposed Master of Science in informatics offers specializations in data analytics, biomedical informatics, knowledge and information management, and user experience design.  The goal of the Master of Science in informatics is to enable students to apply informatics in their respective disciplines. To achieve that goal, the department proposes first to establish the new degree itself, providing specializations from within the school; and then to offer interdisciplinary five-year B.S./M.S. programs and dual degrees with other schools at IUPUI to meet the competitive requirements of Indiana’s job market.  Informatics has become not only an integral part of many disciplines and professions but also an essential skill for graduates.  The Master of Science in informatics will expand career opportunities of undergraduate students and degree holders in nontechnical disciplines by enabling them to apply information technology skills to their own field or to transition into information technology fields.

    "body": "  ## School partnership with Hope Training Academy studies tech training in a virtual world  April 13, 2022  When Zebulun Wood , lecturer and director of the Media Arts and Science (MAS) undergraduate program at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, is not teaching in the classroom, he’s educating in and about the virtual space. Virtual reality, that is.  [Zebulun Wood](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/zeb-wood/)  Wood and Angela Murillo , Ph.D., assistant professor in the Department of Library and Information Science, embarked on a new research project last fall, partnering with Rick Barretto and his Hope Training Academy (HTA) in Indianapolis.  [Angela Murillo](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/angela-murillo/)  [Hope Training Academy](https://hopetrainingacademy.org/)  The School of Informatics and Computing team, including Alex Nichols, a senior studying 3D Graphics and Animation in MAS, Patrick Tener, senior MAS major, and Mayank Saxena and Pranali Shinde, HCI grad students, set out to develop in VR an entire set of lessons for HTA on how to build a computer—beginning with the chapter on power supplies.  Wood is heading the production management of the application, surveying tools, and data collection of the study and will also lead the building of a scalable VR tool to be able to use in any educational context. Wood teaches undergraduates and graduates content creation skills to create virtual reality experiences.  Wood says, “Project partnerships like working with Angela, our students, and Hope Training Academy illustrate the power of innovative thinking that may not otherwise be able to happen in a traditional 16-week semester or a non-profit’s budget.  Our students get to practice the skills they have learned within classes across many different domains (3D, Game Development, User Experience Research, Learning Research) within our school while contributing to findings that COULD reveal that Virtual Reality (and the spatial component it affords) for learners is better than traditional means of learning. The best part is that they work on teams, together, that could never be assembled in one class or even one degree.  This is much more like working with (young) experts that you would encounter at a game production studio, for example.  “I often use the analogy that VR for learners can capture that same magic and joy in learning that Miss Frizzle’s class experienced on ‘The Magic School Bus’ animated series.  VR transports learners anywhere, at any time in history, to places both in the past and imagined.  I am really excited to see what HTA’s learners tell us about this early prototype and if they are excited to learn in VR.  Thanks Rick, Hope Training Academy, and our whole team for partnering in this mission. Go IU!”  Murillo is heading the educational research component of the study, developing pre-test and post-test of course assessments, research instruments, data collection, data analysis and dissemination of research results. Murillo, director of the Applied Data and Information Science undergraduate program who has worked in industry, government agencies, and academia, is an expert in data fluency and data-related education.  “The theoretical concepts and the research design are an extension of the study I conducted for my SEIRI grant . This study with HTA will capture data related to retention of concepts and student learning, student engagement, and ease of use of the VR environment and provide pilot data for future work examining VR in learning environments,” Murillo says.  [SEIRI grant](https://seiri.iupui.edu/fundingopportunities/ssg/2019-ssg-awards.html#5)  Barretto has long been a pioneer in exploring new applications for emerging tech with his latest venture being improved access to tech education for the masses, especially within underserved populations. The data collected through his online learning tools will allow the VR data from this research project to be directly compared to traditional (in-person) and 2D digital learning experiences.  Barretto and Wood met around 2018 when Baretto’s esports gaming center partnered with IUPUI to sponsor their first League of Legends tournament to raise awareness of esports and IUPUI’s programs throughout the Midwest. They worked together again when Wood’s students created virtual walkthroughs of HTA classrooms including interactive hotspots. Barretto says his organization has many ideas but spends much of their time spent running day-to-day operations. Working with IUPUI and its resources in people and expertise gives them the chance to have support in asking these questions about overall educational outcomes and to more rapidly prototype and execute their concepts.  “We have seen so much need statewide for education and jobs as we help students and Hoosiers bridge ‘the digital divide.’ In the incredible number of students we have worked with we know that anything we can do to help give access to education and add interactivity and immersion will help further simulate real world learning scenarios. Many of our students don’t have access to the IT computer or hardware resources to effectively train and gain experience in IT,” Barretto says. “We believe this partnership with Indiana University will help greatly extend reach to other Hoosiers who need training and jobs. Combining leading-edge VR and educational research technologies with one of the leading schools in the nation and partnering with other funding partners will help us increase completion rates, retention and fill more jobs for unemployed Hoosiers.”  Wood will also serve as a co-investigator with Murillo and will assist her research team in addressing the following research questions: Does VR improve student learning, engagement, knowledge, short-term and long-term retention and Can VR be implemented in technical courses to provide students’ hands-on training? The short-term goals of this project are to implement VR into courses at the HTA certification classes and to test how these impacts various aspects of student learning. The long-term goals are to build a model/software tool for utilizing VR in technology courses, from the student perspective, instructor perspective, and long-term implementation perspective.  Nichols is the 3D artist on the team, responsible for creating all of the computer parts, the room the player is in, lighting, colors, and just about everything that the player sees. “It’s important that I make the parts look believable enough that once the subject goes from the simulation to real life, all of the knowledge and practice they have will translate into the real world,” Nichols says. “Not only do the parts have to look good, I have to make sure that all of the parts, ports, screws, and slots fit together accurately and tightly just like they do in the real world.”  [grid size=”halves”]  [/grid]  Nichols says that this is the most rewarding project he has ever worked on because of its potential to impact the future of learning in a positive way—especially so because it involves VR. “Watching people step into the world we created never gets old because everyone has a reaction to it even if they have been in VR before. There is a lot of building excitement for the future when we will start to see the results of our hard work,” he says. Nichols hopes to continue working in VR after graduation on 3D interactive projects ranging from video games to architecture visualization.   ### About Rick Barretto and Hope Training Academy  Rick Barretto, an IU alumnus of Kelley School of Business and School of Computer Science, is a visionary entrepreneur, inventor, strategist, and published author.

    "body": "  ## Students and faculty team up with IMA to bring exhibit to life  April 27, 2015  Thousands of people are expected to visit the Indianapolis Museum of Art to see a motor vehicle spectacle when it arrives in May. When they do, they will have their experience enhanced by an app developed by two Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing students.  “Dream Cars: Innovative Design, Visionary Ideas ,” will feature rare concept cars from the early 1930s to the 21 st century, showcasing some of the most unique vehicles ever created by top names in the automotive field.  Visitors drawn by the radical, curvaceous motor vehicle designs will be able to use an app on a museum iPad or downloaded to their own tablets that was developed by Vance Vaden, a graduate student, and Michael Auer, a freshman. Vaden was project manager and animator. Auer was interaction developer.  The app offers insights into car design by letting app users design their own cars, learning about decisions that contribute to the cost, fuel efficiency and speed in the process.  Vaden and Auer began work on the app in September, working with a museum design team. The app was completed in December.  “It’s fairly experimental for all of us right now,” said Zeb Wood , a Media Arts and Science lecturer in the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI. “The museum wanted to try using technology to enhance the exhibit and we wanted to give students the chance to work on a real-world project for real clients.”  [Zeb Wood](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/zeb-wood/)  [Media Arts and Science](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/undergraduate/media-arts/)  Among the app requirements: it had to be entertaining and easy to use for all ages, yet more informative for adults.  The challenge that faced the students was between “kind of hard and really hard, these two wanted the opportunity, and we briefed them, they have been dealing with an entire committee at the IMA ever since.” Wood said. “We have students that sometimes graduate without creating something like this. Now we have a freshman and a first-semester graduate student creating fully function apps. This is a huge jump for us.”  The success of the project will open the eyes of other students, Wood said. “They are going to say I don’t have to wait four years to try to create something for a community partner. I can get started right away.”  The experience is one Auer won’t forget.  “This project has given me the chance to learn about working with a professional development team,” he said. “My previous projects were mostly solo ventures and so making the transition to a team based one was incredibly enlightening. Since most projects in the real world are centered around group work and deadlines, experiencing these things really improved my skills.”  Auer, who volunteered for the project, said his ability to write algorithms and his problem-solving abilities increased ten-fold. “There is a big difference between working for yourself and working for a large art museum and I believe that it really pushed me to become better at what I do.”  Varden also found the project to be an interesting experience. “Having an actual client definitely changed the way I approached each task since everything I did was for them, rather than for a grade and myself. I found myself communicating more and paying close attention to wording and detail a lot more than I usually would,” he said.   “The internship was probably the best experience I had this semester since I got more professional experience, and worked in a different environment than I had ever worked in previously.”  What makes this particular project unique is the fact that the museum is so willing to work in tandem with the school’s students, treating this as a learning experience for both student and the professionals on the IMA side of things, said Travis Faas, a Media Arts and Science lecturer.  Perhaps the most interesting part of this project is the skill levels involved, he said. “The primary developer, Michael, was a first-semester freshman going into this project. Working along with this team he has had more opportunity to learn ‘how it is done’ in the real world compared to many of his peers. It is a real eye-opener to learn just how much work goes into the production of an even relatively simple app.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## LIS professor receives IMLS grant to research learning analytics and privacy  May 1, 2018  Kyle M. L. Jones, assistant professor in the Department of Library and Information Science (LIS) at the Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, has received a $514,000 three-year grant (#LG-96-18-0044018) from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS).  The project, “Getting to know their data doubles: An inquiry into student perceptions of privacy issues associated with academic library participation in learning analytics,” is a collaboration between IUPUI and researchers at six other academic institutions. Jones is the principal investigator on the grant.  Mathew J. Palakal, senior executive associate dean of the School of Informatics and Computing, said, “This is certainly a remarkable achievement. We congratulate Kyle on receiving this highly competitive grant.”  Learning analytics is the measurement, collection, analysis, and reporting of student and other data. Goals of learning analytics are to identify factors that impede or promote success, enhance pedagogy, reinforce student learning outcomes, shore up retention rates, and improve institutional efficiencies, among others.  Libraries are pursuing learning analytics to evaluate the impact of library services, collections, and spaces on student learning. Higher education administrators often expect their libraries to tie efforts and resource expenditures to student success. Learning analytics is one way to demonstrate these metrics.  Andrea Copeland, chair of the LIS department, said “Librarians’ professional ethics have always placed considerable value on an individual’s right to privacy and Dr. Jones’ work will provide leadership in this new area of concern—safeguarding the privacy of academic library users.”  Like other data mining and analytic practices, learning analytics raises a number of questions around privacy. The team wants to learn what privacy issues students identify in relation to particular technologies, goals, and data practices, types and sources—especially as these things relate to library initiatives. They will also explore how perceptions change based on demographics, which library and non-library learning analytics scenarios are acceptable to students, and how students would resolve any existing privacy problems.  Jones says, “It is necessary to respect the privacy of our students, and this research will give them a voice. There are a lot of assumptions floating around that students don’t care about their privacy. That may be so, but we need empirical evidence to back up these claims and inform institutional uses of student data.”  Researchers will conduct preliminary interviews with students to identify themes, then survey undergrad and graduate students at each researcher’s institution. Following that, they will run a series of focus groups to explore possible learning analytics applications that respect and break expectations of privacy.  The team is currently developing a website to disseminate findings and discuss progress, but their work is immediately accessible by following their Twitter account, @datadoubles. In addition to publishing and presenting their work, they also plan to create research-informed training sessions, teach workshops at participating institutions, and develop “Libraries, Learning Analytics, and Student Privacy: A Toolkit,” which will be deposited in IUPUI’s institutional repository at year three.  Jones is joined by the following members of the research team :  ·      Andrew Asher, Indiana University-Bloomington ·      Kristin Briney, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee ·      Abigail Goben, University of Illinois at Chicago ·      Michael Perry, Northwestern University ·      M. Brooke Robertshaw, Oregon State University ·      Dorothea Salo, University of Wisconsin-Madison   ### About IMLS  The Institute of Museum and Library Services is the primary source of federal support for the nation’s approximately 120,000 libraries and 35,000 museums.

His pioneering approach to programming helped him develop the concept of platform as a service in cloud computing, catapulting ServiceNow into a multi-billion dollar company and landing Luddy on the cover of Forbes Magazine as one of the top 100 innovators alive .  [one of the top 100 innovators alive](https://www.forbes.com/feature/innovative-companies-service-now/#4e6ecef5c603)  Born in New Castle, Indiana, Luddy arrived on the IU campus in 1973 and immediately pursued his passion for programming. He saw the future in technology, and he found success beyond his wildest imaginations. When a setback in the early 2000s left him looking for a new path, his drive to identify the next revolution allowed him to see how ServiceNow could make an impact on the world.  The willingness to accept change has been a hallmark of his career.  The world today is so different than it was even 10 years ago. If the world and the human condition is going to change, and change radically, I surely would rather be part of the driving force of that change than to have it thrust upon me.  Luddy showcased his philanthropical vision when his generous gift served as a catalyst for the construction of spectacular Luddy Hall, the home of the then-School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering. Luddy Hall quickly become an interdisciplinary hotbed of innovation on the IU Bloomington campus.  In 2019, Luddy bestowed a historic gift that will propel the school into the future. In honor of Luddy’s generosity—the second-largest private gift in IU history—the school was named the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering. Along with support for faculty and both graduate and undergraduate students, Luddy’s gift will allow the creation and construction of the Luddy Center for Artificial Intelligence, which will have an initial focus on AI approaches to digital health.  “Predictions are that 2050 may not be recognizable from today,” Luddy says. “Medicine, energy, transportation, communication, sustenance will all surely be radically different than today. In 1948, a group of scientists were already dreaming of AI and autonomous transportation, the very beginnings of which are upon us today.  “More has changed in the human condition in the past 200 years than in the prior 12,000 years. This change is non-linear, ever accelerating. My family and I are so pleased to be a small part of realizing this great vision started by President Herman B Wells and now carried on by President Michael McRobbie, supercomputer Big Red 200, and the many fantastic faculty and students who will learn, research, and create a wonderful future here with a vision to improve the human condition.” "

    "body": "  ## Informatics medical animation featured in public television series on health  April 30, 2009  One of the great values of 3D animation, as taught in the Media Arts and Science program, IU School of Informatics and Computing, is the ability to make complex issues easier to understand. That’s been the longtime mantra of Albert William, an IUPUI research associate. To that end, a health-related animation project created by William is featured in an important series of broadcasts on public television stations across Indiana.  Mastering Your Health is a new half-hour television program aimed at educating the public on how to take control of their health. An episode about diabetes treatment and prevention includes an animation of views of anatomic structures and cellular processes involved with, and related to, diabetes. William, who teaches 3D stereoscopic animation at the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, is the animation’s creator.  “This episode of Mastering Your Health utilizes animation as a tool to help people understand the ‘unseen’ aspects of the disease,” explained William. “We are using these visualizations to help people understand the structures in the body that are at risk for diabetes, and to give a simplified description of how the body creates and processes insulin.”  The first two segments, which will air on eight public broadcasting service (PBS) stations in Indiana in April, May, and June, will focus on diabetes and skin health, respectively. Each of the Mastering Your Health segments will include information on nutrition and physical activity. Plans call for contacting the other 49 states, inviting them to participate in this integrated TV/radio programming project.  Content for the Mastering Your Health segments was developed with input from IUPUI, Ball State University, Butler University, Purdue University, Chef Academy, and Indiana Medical Group. Each episode features a variety of experts including well-known accredited chefs, chiropractors, clinical nutritionists, medical doctors, physical therapists, and psychologists.  “Our access to nationally recognized medical experts, our affiliations with leading university researchers, and our inter-disciplinary approach will allow us to deliver and explore medical topics from all perspectives in order to offer both sound medical solutions and unique natural alternatives,” explained Shawn Benzinger, DC, DACBO; CEO and president, Mastering Your Health in a news release.  The first two episodes of Mastering Your Health will appear on the following PBS stations in the state: WTIU-TV, Bloomington WNIT-TV, Elkhart WNIN, Evansville WFWA-TV, Fort Wayne WFYI-TV Indianapolis WYIN-TV, Merrillville WIPB-TV, Muncie WVUT-TV, Vincennes  A Web site, Mastering Your Health, showcases cooking recipes, exercise programs, and extended health-related interviews.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that the demand for computing jobs will outpace other U.S. job markets in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Nearly 75% of new science or engineering openings will be in computing, compared to just 16% in traditional engineering jobs.  A June 1 hiring study by Dice Holdings, which operates Dice.com and other job boards for technology professionals, found that approximately three quarters of employers and recruiters intend to increase hiring by 10-20% over the second half of 2010.  Supporting Dice’s finding is a June 2 “Help Wanted Online” report by The Conference Board, a non-profit business advocacy group, that indicates the number of computing and technology positions available continues to lead other fields in online job postings.  Salaries and job stability for computing hires also look promising. The Dice study reported that 25% of employers are increasing salaries for new hires. Furthermore, approximately 70% of employers polled do not anticipate layoffs and recruiting for new hires has more than doubled since fall of 2009.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## New integrated degrees prepare students for wider range of career opportunities  August 11, 2015  The IU School of Informatics and Computing (SoIC) in Indianapolis will expand their accelerated degree options beginning fall 2015 with integrated degrees with the School of Science and the School of Physical Education and Tourism Management (PETM).  The Accelerated Five-Year BS/MS Degree Program allows students to complete complementary bachelor’s and master’s degree programs in a shorter time, giving them a head start on their career.  The two schools are jointly offering an integrated five-year BS/MS degree with the School of Informatics and Computing consisting of a Bachelor of Science in Biology through the School of Science and Master of Science in Bioinformatics and Bachelor of Science in Tourism, Conventions, and Event Management through the School of PETM and a Master of Science in Informatics with a specialization in sports analytics. These are in addition to the Bachelor of Science in Health Sciences and Master of Science in Health Informatics that was approved earlier this spring with the School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences. “The BS/MS program has several features that are attractive to students and employers, including greater breadth (BS) and depth (MS) of interdisciplinary programs and informatics fundamentals; better starting salary upon completion of the program; better career growth opportunities; and better preparedness to meet employment opportunities and challenges,” said Karl MacDorman, Associate Dean of Academic Affairs for the School of Informatics and Computing.  Those obtaining the BS/MS degree will graduate with advanced skills preparing them for the career paths of tomorrow. According to the Economics and Statistics Administration, in the past 10 years science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) jobs have grown three times as fast as those in other professions and STEM workers are less likely to experience joblessness than their non-STEM counterparts. STEM occupations are projected to grow 17% by 2018 compared with 9.8% for non-STEM occupations.  Consistent with IUPUI’s vision and mission, the BS/MS degree provides students with intensive hands-on experiential and problem-solving learning. The primary benefits of this combined degree program are to broaden students’ career horizons by allowing them to receive two degrees in a shorter time frame and at lower costs than it would take to pursue the degrees separately.  Students interested in applying for the integrated degree will be able to do so in the sixth semester of their BS or when they have successfully completed their first five semesters (75 credit hours) with a cumulative undergraduate GPA of 3.25 or higher. The School of Informatics and Computing will waive all application fees.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

This investment builds on the firm’s previous support, nearing $500,000, to expand IT education for iDEW students, as well as summer employment and internships in partnership with Project Indy, a program of EmployIndy.  The COVID-19 crisis and associated economic impact, including a 14.7 percent U.S. unemployment rate, are leading to less access to summer jobs, part-time work and internships that teens rely on to support themselves and their families. By 2020, 65 percent of jobs in the U.S. will require some postsecondary education, training or credential. These heightened expectations will require young people to gain work experience and develop skills today to enable them to compete in the global workforce in the future.  Last year’s program enabled 127 iDEW students to participate in summer jobs or internships and the goal for 2020 is to increase that number.  “JPMorgan Chase has been a strong supporter of the iDEW program since the very beginning, for the past five years,” said Mathew J. Palakal, senior executive associate dean at the School of Informatics and Computing. “This years’ $100K grant from JPMorgan Chase to support the iDEW Summer Youth Employment Program is wonderfully timely and much needed to keep the iDEW students engaged during the summer months given the COVID-19 situation. Through this support from JPMorgan Chase, the iDEW staff was able to support participating students last year and again this year.”  Five years ago, JPMorgan Chase and the School of Informatics and Computing collaborated to launch a new initiative to promote IT education to underserved youth in Indianapolis. The resulting Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce , or iDEW, program has served nearly 1700 students in eight area high schools to date, having just celebrated its fifth year in operation.  [Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce](https://luddy.iupui.edu/idew/)  “Indianapolis, like nearly every city across the country, is feeling significant impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly under resourced communities and young people,” said Jim Macdonald, Market Manager for Indiana and Kentucky for J.P. Morgan Private Bank. “We know that young people depend on summer jobs to provide critical income to their families. JPMorgan Chase is working with partners like IUPUI to ensure that young people continue to find opportunities for work-based learning experiences and help prepare them with the skills they need for jobs of the future.”  [IUPUI](https://www.iupui.edu/)  The iDEW program began with just three classes in 2015 and expanded to 30 classes in 2019-20 for a total of 160 classes over 5 years. Student participation also increased, from 75 in year one to 815 in year five. Of those, 79 percent were people of color and 24 percent were women. Seventy-two percent of graduates from the iDEW program attend a 2- or 4-year college with 75 percent of those pursuing a STEM degree.  Students in the iDEW program also registered in 260 dual credit courses; participated in 31 internships; took part in industry visits, and attended Black Data Processing Associates (BDPA), Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing, and Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing conferences. In addition, iDEW students have had the opportunity to participate in summer educational programming in partnership with BDPA, Code Black Indy, and beLithe – including SAT prep, speaking college, and scrum training – as well as workshops provided by the School of Informatics and Computing.  This summer, iDEW educational programming was successfully offered virtually due to the pandemic, and plans are being made to continue to offer the program throughout the coming school year through various instructional modalities.  This investment is a part of JPMorgan Chase’s $350M New Skills at Work program, including the firm’s $17 million, five-year commitment to U.S. cities working to increase the number of teens with access to quality summer work experiences that put them on a path to greater economic mobility. This nationwide effort continues to equip young people with the skills and experiences they need to succeed and bridge the gap between the demand for summer jobs and the number of available positions.

    "body": "  ## Health Information Management student Tarek Matar receives IHIMA Rising Star Award  May 10, 2023  Tarek Matar, a senior studying for a B.S. in Health Information Management (HIM) recently received the Indiana Health Information Management Association (IHIMA) Rising Star Award at the annual IHIMA meeting. Matar also won the IHIMA annual meeting theme naming competition for 2024. “I was honored that my theme “The Legacy of Health Information” was selected for the 2024 IHIMA Annual Event and I hope that this theme will give HIM professionals a chance to reflect on our many achievements,” he said.  [Health Information Management](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/undergraduate/him/)  Matar noted that reflection is one of the most valuable tools for development as one can analyze the progression, successes, or setbacks of something. The HIM field, like many others, has gone through significant advances these past decades, so taking the time to reflect on growth felt like an excellent opportunity to spark motivation and recognize the individuals who are involved.  IHIMA President Necole Coots said,  “Tarek has created opportunities for himself. Tarek’s passion and enthusiasm for HIM are evident in his willingness to assist with any endeavor. Tarek is looking to make an impact in the healthcare field. We are excited to have Tarek in the health information profession.”  Upon starting college, Matar was interested in studying health information and found the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering a prestigious school for this respective field. He also spoke with current students to learn about their experiences within different programs in Luddy. Ultimately, he was able to gauge potential opportunities that aligned with his goals and found the committed faculty in Luddy to be very reassuring.  “Being able to make a difference in healthcare has always been a passion of mine. During the COVID-19 Pandemic, I worked as a personal care assistant in an assisted living environment and found my experience extremely rewarding. The patients on the receiving end were a major influence, and through my experience, I utilized various technologies that aided in the management and use of their health information. This led me to choose an HIM major as I would still be able to support patient care and the technologies involved,” Matar said.  Nicole Van Andel, lecturer in the HIM program, said, “Tarek is an exemplary student who loves the health information profession. He brings an enthusiastic spirit to everything that he does. He is highly deserving of this amazing honor at this point in his career. He will be a true asset to the profession.”  Being a part of his major’s affiliated club, HIM Connections, has been one of Matar’s many highlights while at Luddy. He has been able to take on the role of vice-president within the club and gain valuable leadership experience. He said another highlight is fostering terrific relationships with his fellow students, faculty, and academic advisor who have supported him these past years.  Matar plans to pursue a career in information security for a healthcare or pharmaceutical organization and to continue his education at IUPUI. Through his internship experiences, he has found that this field will allow him to support a vital role of healthcare delivery: securing an organization’s information assets.  Matar’s advice to students who may be interested in Health Information Management is that it is a versatile major that will allow them to seek an array of career opportunities such as health IT, data management, analytics, healthcare reimbursement coding, and others. He recommends that students assess their career goals and passions to locate areas of interest in the HIM field, and speak with the HIM faculty as they have a wealth of knowledge in the field and will support students throughout their journey in the program.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Janga named as standing member of NIH’s Molecular NeuroGenetics Study Section  April 27, 2022  The National Institutes of Health has selected Associate Professor Sarath Chandra Janga, Ph.D., in the Department of Biohealth Informatics , Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing (SoIC) at IUPUI, to serve a four-year term as a standing member of the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) Molecular NeuroGenetics (MNG) Study Section.  [Department of Biohealth Informatics](https://luddy.iupui.edu/biohealth/)  The National Institutes of Health is the nation’s medical research agency and the largest source of funding for medical research in the world. Study sections review grant applications submitted to the NIH, make recommendations on these applications to the appropriate NIH national advisory council or board, and survey the status of research in their fields of science. These functions are of great value to medical and allied research in the United States.  “I am very honored by this recognition of my expertise in cutting-edge technologies emerging in genomics, bioinformatics, and data science, and the opportunity to contribute to one of the most rigorous and fundamentally important processes of the NIH,” Janga said. “This puts SoIC and IUPUI on the map as a contributor to the national biomedical research effort and gives me an opportunity to view and assess top-quality research. I believe this will help me to not only provide critical input for improving the research quality in neurogenetics on the campus but also advise various colleagues in employing interdisciplinary, data-driven skills to address fundamental problems in a wide range of fields from psychiatry to radiology.”  Neurogenetics studies the role of genetics in the development and function of the nervous system and focuses in particular on how the genetic code carried by an organism affects its expressed traits. Mutations in this genetic sequence can have a wide range of effects impacting neurological diseases, behavior, and personality. The field of neurogenetics emerged in the mid to late 20th century and currently is the center of much research utilizing cutting-edge techniques.  The director of the NIH’s Center for Scientific Review, Noni Byrnes, said, “You have been nominated because of your demonstrated competence and achievement in your scientific discipline as evidenced by the quality of your research accomplishments, publications in scientific journals, and other significant scientific activities, achievements, and honors. Service on a study section also requires mature judgment and objectivity as well as the ability to work effectively in a group, qualities we believe you will bring to this important task.”  In addition to his work with the NIH, Janga’s pioneering work on RNA regulatory processes and RNA-protein interactions is supporting by multiple NIH and NSF grants, the U.S-Indo collaboration forum, as well as an LRAP award from the Lilly Research Award Program to dissect the role of RNA-mediated alterations in health and disease. Janga’s lab works at the interface of multidisciplinary sciences employing both experimental and computational methods to develop novel technologies for studying cellular systems, with most recent work diversifying into medical informatics by employing retinal imaging data to study the early onset of diabetic retinopathy and various retinal diseases. Work led by his lab in collaboration with ophthalmologists and molecular biologists at IU is supported by a pilot grant from the Artificial Intelligence Institute on the IUPUI campus.

After earning a BA in History from Ball State University in 2013 and an MA in Public History with a Museum Studies certificate from IUPUI in 2015, Blair applied to the School of Informatics and Computing to pursue an Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS) degree.  [Master of Library and Information Science](https://luddy.iupui.edu/lis/master-library-science/)  Blair’s professional career has consisted mostly of performing archival, collections, curatorial, and public programming work for many cultural institutions in Indianapolis, including the Indiana State Museum, Eiteljorg Museum, and Indiana Historical Society (IHS). She believes the MLIS will supplement her previous education, specifically in enhancing her digital curation skills.  She applied for and was awarded the Wilma Gibbs Moore Endowed Scholarship in 2019. Ms. Moore, who received her BS in Sociology and MLS from Indiana University, worked for 30 years as senior archivist of African-American History at the Indiana History Center and dedicated her life to building a more inclusive history. Coincidentally, Blair had worked with Moore to process the Bethel A.M.E. Church collection, as well as the Madam C.J. Walker collection, while at IHS.  [Wilma Gibbs Moore Endowed Scholarship](https://luddy.iupui.edu/alumni-partners/moore-scholarship/)  “Hopefully, I will be able to join the ranks of Wilma and other Black professionals in Indianapolis—such as Kisha Tandy, Susan Hall Dotson, Nichelle Hayes, and Willie Miller—as an advocate for greater diversity in the field,” Blair said. Many of them along with Andrea Copeland, chair of the LIS Department, encouraged her to apply for the Scholarship and have continued to offer guidance and support during her time in the MLIS program.  In the future, Blair hopes “to find a position where I can combine my public history skills with my future digital curation skills—collections, curation, web archiving, and preservation” and is especially interested in working with born-digital content.     ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Students celebrate Gen Con with games, costumes, role play and Tracy Hickman  July 23, 2010  Students and faculty turn the School of Informatics and Computing into the land of “geekdom” with the return of the IUPUI Gen Con Extravaganza — a free evening of gaming and fantasy open to the IUPUI community and the general public.  This year welcomes best-selling fantasy author Tracy Hickman. Hickman is the author or co-author of more than 40 fantasy novels, and has created a number of role-playing products. He began his career writing for the “Dungeons and Dragons” game.  Hickman, accompanied by his wife Laura, will lead one of his hugely-popular “Killer Dinner” performances. The “Killer Dinner” is a twist on the Hickmans’ famous “Killer Breakfasts” where the duo take on all comers in wacky, no-holds-barred role playing game. Seating is limited to the first 200 guests. Hickman’s “Killer Breakfast” performance at Gen Con is sold-out, so this will be the only other opportunity for individuals to take part in the “Killer” experience.  Hickman will follow his performance with a discussion of his new project, “Dragon’s Bard,” and the future of fantasy literature in our changing media landscape. He will answer questions from the audience and be available afterwards to sign any books guests bring with them. Guests will also be able to subscribe online to “Dragon’s Bard.”  Other events include a standard-rule Magic the Gathering tournament, costume role play (cosplay) and a costume contest with prizes. At this time, the costume contest is open only to IUPUI students with a valid student ID.  This is the second year for the IUPUI Gen Con Extravaganza. Its mission is to increase the sense of community among gamers on the IUPUI campus and in Indianapolis, taking advantage of the excitement built by the Gen Con gaming convention held annually in the city.  The primary driving force behind the event is the students and faculty of the School’s Media Arts and Science program, many of whom are avid gamers and Gen Con enthusiasts who wish to bring a piece of the Gen Con energy back “home” to the School. In addtion to several other specialties, the Media Arts and Science program offers students the opportunity to transform their passion for gaming into an understanding of how to use digital technology and communication principles to build and develop their own games.  The end result? Maybe one day they’ll be showing off their own successful games at Gen Con.

    "body": "  ## Bioinformatics researchers identify protein mechanisms behind limb regeneration  February 15, 2010  The most comprehensive study to date of the proteins in a species of salamander able to regrow appendages may provide important clues to how similar regeneration could be medically induced in humans who have experienced severe tissue damage.  Bioinformatics researchers from the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI collaborated with the IU Center for Regenerative Biology and Medicine and other colleagues to investigate more than 300 proteins in the amputated limbs of axolotls. Axolotls are a type of salamander with the unique natural ability to regenerate appendages. Researchers hope this knowledge will contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms that allow limbs to regenerate. Their findings were published online in the journal Biomedical Central Biology on November 30 (BMC Biology 7:83, 2009).  Bioinformatics was essential to the study’s success. “Traditionally, biological research has focused on analyzing one or few proteins at a time. Bioinformatics allows us to look holistically at proteins that carry out the regeneration process,” said Mathew Palakal, Ph.D. and Director of the Text Information Mining, Analysis, Prediction Laboratory (TiMAP) within the IU School of Informatics and Computing. This research specifically examined the networks and relationships between identified proteins. “We analyzed the patterns of expression in proteins present during regeneration – how they differ at various points in the process,” said Deepali Jhamb, a Ph.D. candidate in Bioinformatics and co-author of the study. “We were then able to determine functional clusters in the data that are critical to limb regrowth.” Future research will utilize additional systems biology tools to develop a global protein map of limb regeneration.  With few exceptions – notably the antlers of moose, deer and their close relatives, the tips of the fingers and toes of humans and rodents, and the ear tissue of certain strains of mice and rabbits – the appendages of mammals do not regenerate after amputation. Limb regeneration in the axolotl occurs when undifferentiated cells accumulate under the wound epidermis at the amputation site, a process known as the establishment of a blastema. These cells are derived by the reprogramming of differentiated cells to a less specialized state, and from resident stem cells.  Investigating the proteins found in the axolotl limb, the researchers noted three findings that appear to have significance in reprogramming cells to grow new limbs: 1.) Quantities of enzymes involved in metabolism decreased significantly during the regeneration process; 2.) There were many critical proteins that helped prevent cell death after traumatic amputation; 3.) A protein that appears to keep cells from dividing until they are fully dedifferentiated and reprogrammed to form a new limb was expressed at high levels throughout blastema formation.  Co-authors of the study, which was funded by the W. M. Keck Foundation, are David L. Stocum, Ph.D., Nandini Rao, Ph.D. and graduate student Behnaz Saranjami of the School of Science; Fengyu Song, D.D.S., M.S., Ph.D. of the IU School of Dentistry; Mu Wang, Ph.D. and Michael W.

    "body": "  ## Working as a compositor at MPC Technicolor is nothing but fun for MAS alumnus Joshua Barriger  June 14, 2023  Media Arts and Science alumnus Joshua Barriger’s passion for movies led him to working today on such films as The Witcher, Quantumania, and Transformers. He graduated from Luddy IUPUI in May 2022, with a specialization in 3D and a minor in Audio and Video. and quickly found work as a compositor at MPC Technicolor in Montreal, Canada. Originally when coming to Luddy IUPUI, he wanted to pursue video game creation, but shortly after taking a few coding classes he knew the coding side of video games wasn’t for him. so he decided to pursue the 3D side of video game creation.  [Media Arts and Science](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/undergraduate/media-arts/)  [MPC Technicolor](https://www.technicolorcreative.com/studios/mpc/)  “What started as focusing on asset creation and modeling, soon turned into a passion for all things 3D. I felt the need to take all courses involving 3D, modeling, texturing, organic modeling, animation, unreal, lighting, etc. During this time I had also found a passion for film, learning a lot about audio and video. During my third year at IUPUI, I was told about the 3D compositing class, which had really piqued my interest in mixing film and 3D, both things I clearly had passion for. So come that fourth year, I took the 3D compositing course and I knew that was what I wanted to pursue. Having all the other 3D skills on my toolbelt definitely was a good thing to have, but now I had one specific field I wanted to get into,” Barriger said.   ### SoIC was just one big highlight  Barriger chose Luddy IUPUI (then School of Informatics and Computing or SoIC) because his cousin Jordan Barriger had already been there for a year prior and had told him a lot of wonderful things about the program and school, and it was just the best fit for him, being so close to home and being in the middle of downtown Indianapolis.  “There are too many great memories of my time at Luddy IUPUI/SoIC to talk about, but I will share a few. The connections and friends I made at SoIC are some of the best in my life. Without coming to SoIC, I wouldn’t have met some of these amazing people without taking courses with them through SoIC,” he said.  Barriger’s independent study with MAS lecturer Zebulun Wood was a big highlight for him, as this was the time he got to learn Nuke (VFX and film editing software) and really dive into what would eventually turn into his career. “It was an opportunity for me to teach myself, to rely solely on myself to learn and gave me all the responsibilities for a whole semester,” he said. “During this time, Zeb and I had formed a great bond and he had become a very important mentor to me. Zeb Wood had the biggest impact on me both personally and professionally. He was a mentor to me for the last 3 years at IUPUI, and continues to be a mentor and friend to me even after leaving IUPUI. Zeb had shown me not only how to apply myself in what I was learning in 3D, but how to apply myself professionally and helped me become ready for the real world. His methods of teaching in some of the courses he provides is what really helped me get through tough times in college where I wasn’t sure what I was doing was, well, what I wanted to do. He’s been a great mentor to me and a great friend.”  [Zebulun Wood](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/zeb-wood/)  Barriger said his Capstone was also a huge highlight. He got to work on an amazing project where his friend Isaac Johnston and he made a short 30-second shot all in Unreal. They used a virtual camera, where they could move virtually in their Unreal scene and record the camera movement, set up and used motion capture to have our CG characters animate, and themed it all around a mash-up of WW1 and medieval crusaders. “It was an extremely ambitious project but I am super proud of what we achieved and for how many people enjoyed my presentation of it at Capstone. I set up a huge TV with the Unreal scene loaded and a VR Vive controller mounted to a camera rig, so people could walk up and become the camera man! It not only showed off our amazing work, but it informed people of what was a newer technology of virtual cameras and virtual productions, mixing real world movements and cameras with the virtual world,” he said.  I feel overall, SoIC was just one big highlight. So many memories and moments in my life are based off being part of the amazing SoIC family. I am in my career because of my SoIC family, the opportunities that arose because of being here and the knowledge shared by each of my professors and peers throughout my years at Luddy IUPUI/SoIC.  He said the biggest highlight post-graduation was obviously moving to Montreal and working at MPC. “Moving to a whole other country was a mix of emotions, happy, scared, sad and excitement. It was extremely hard leaving my family and moving to a different country. So often I thought I couldn’t do it and I would fail and come back to Indiana. But I kept going, I stuck with it and I proved myself wrong. I could do it and I did it. I am proud of all I have done in the past year,” Barriger said.   ### Life as a compositor: nothing but fun and excitement  Barriger’s job now is a Compositor at MPC Technicolor. He said he actually got a little lucky landing this job as originally, he was hired at Mr. X, which was in the process of merging with MPC. He had spent a lot of time job hunting but found this job through LinkedIn.  “I chose this career because of so many reasons, but it all boils down to passion. Ever since I was a kid, I had always loved movies,” he said. “The earliest movies that I had fallen in love with and really made an impact on me were the Spider-Man films, directed by Sam Raimi, and the Transformers movies. YouTube also played a big role in why VFX was so big for me. I grew up with YouTube. I got to see the beginning of the site and the beginning of a lot of great channels and YouTubers.  “No one was more impactful, though, than a channel called FreddieW. It was a channel where a group of friends worked together and uploaded short films that were full of VFX. The thing that was so special about these guys was that they all taught themselves how to make some amazing visual effects all at home on their own computer. I always thought that was amazing to me, the fact that just some random people could teach themselves some amazing skills in the comfort of their home and share with the world their work. It was just amazing and inspirational to me.  A group with some of the same people that were on the FreddieW channel have their own massively popular channel on YouTube called Corridor Digital. They post some amazing things, like their popular series ‘VFX Artist React’ where they sit down on a couch and react to good, bad and all in between visual effects. It’s a great example of showing off the minds of VFX artists and the things I personally do and think about every day in my career.”  Barriger describes a compositor as the person who puts everything together and finishes up the shots. Basically, they are the one who gets the footage, gets the renders of the CG elements, and puts them together. As a quick example, if the footage has a blue or green screen, they key out the blue or green screen, and are provided with what would replace the blue or green screen to do so.  [grid size=”halves”]  [/grid]  “My experience in my current job has been nothing but fun and excitement for me. I go into the office, and I get to work on movies! How awesome is that?,” Barriger asked. Some of the projects he has worked on are Amsterdam, directed by David O. Russell, The Witcher: Blood Origin, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, and Transformers: Rise of the Beasts. In each of these projects, Barriger did a number of things, from implementing CG characters and creatures, background extensions, painting out things like wires, lights and other things, adding extra people and characters into the shot, and much more. Barriger said with each project he works on, his skills and knowledge as an artist improve, and he gets to bring those skills and knowledge into the next project.  “My proudest moment so far with being at MPC was the opportunity to work on both Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania and Transformers: Rise of the Beasts. Like I mentioned before, I loved the Transformers movies and have always been a Marvel fan, and I had a feeling that within the first 2 years of my career, I would probably work on something Marvel related. I was definitely not expecting that to happen less than a full year into my career. I am super proud of the work I did on the film and super lucky to have worked with the team I worked with,” Barriger said.   ### Teamwork makes, well you know…  Barriger said the big thing that he feels is super important to talk about is teamwork. Each project is always different and that means each team is different. Learning to adapt and help one another is the one thing that he has really started to master after a year at MPC. “Without great teamwork, a project will not be enjoyable to work on. Working together and helping one another is fundamentally how we succeed in this industry,” he said.  “When I first moved to Montreal and started this journey, I was extremely scared and worried I would fail. This was especially the case because I had still felt like I wasn’t good enough to be in this position, to be in my field and my career. I had only taken one course to learn Nuke, which is the industry standard for compositors, and when starting my first day, I really was unsure as to how much I had remembered and extremely worried about not being able to pick it back up and re-learn. All of these things went away after the first week. I had gone through half my training, I had met and talked to some amazing artists that really made me feel like I would fit in and was already part of the team, and I was starting to feel more and more confident that I could do this,” Barriger said.  Barriger said the best advice he could give to anyone who is interested in the path and career he went down, or really any path for that matter, is to take your time. Take your time in learning the things you are learning. Take your time in exploring options in your career. Take your time in applying yourself, academically and professionally, and with applying to jobs in your field. “Before getting a job at MPC, I had applied to about 60 jobs, out of which I only had 3 interviews! That should tell you that taking your time and being patient will always pan out in the long run,” he said. “If you are passionate about something you really want to do in life, always continue trying.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

Gormal (pictured above) and Gray co-founded the full-service agency in 2007, with a vision of doing great work with a big purpose.  “We wanted to do work that made a difference for people, industries, and companies. Ten years later, we are still finding our purpose, helping companies meet their objectives, tell their stories, and connect and engage with new targeted markets,” says Gormal, now president and CMO of Matchbook. Gray is CEO.  Gormal and Gray met during a class where, by process of elimination, they wound up together on a group project. According to Gormal, that was not only the start of their partnership, but also their first paid job, which they were awarded by the client participating in the class project. Freelance work was followed by committed work and then a business model.  Matchbook has expanded from 3 to 17 full-time employees over the decade and has increased its revenue about 25 percent per year. They have outgrown their space twice and moved to a state-of-the-art, three-story building in July, 2016.  Gormal has high praise for the program that prepared her and Gray to be entrepreneurs, and says that it taught them to always think differently and strategically. They found the MAS master’s program instrumental in developing a deeper understanding of digital media and how to apply those practices in the marketing and advertising world.  Joe Defazio , associate professor of media arts and science and co-director of the MAS graduate program, encouraged and believed in Gormal and Gray. “Our background was creative. We did not think like developers or programmers, but he, along with others, encouraged us to apply our creativity to these new mediums,” Gormal says.  [Joe Defazio](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/joseph-defazio/)  Gormal maintains relationships with faculty and staff, who continue to be mentors and networking partners, and hires interns from the MAS program. “We know first-hand the caliber of individuals and talent that is nurtured and developed in this program,” she says. Gormal is also an advisory board member for the program.  Her advice to others considering this path? “This program is a life-changing experience. Once you have committed, look beyond the degree, coursework, and assignments. Ask what is the true value that this program can bring you.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Alumni Film Accepted Into Heartland Film Festival  October 10, 2014  Two Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing alumni filmmakers will have their work screened at the Heartland Film Festival.  An official selection of the festival and part of its Indiana spotlight series, “ Three Months ” will receive its world premier when it is shown during Indiana’s largest and longest-running independent film festival. The festival will showcase more than 130 independent films from filmmakers around the world Oct. 16-25.  [Three Months](http://prod1.agileticketing.net/websales/pages/info.aspx?evtinfo=88361~20589ba4-0f0d-4c54-b2c4-cef4475db0aa&epguid=ba4a8f5a-f1df-407d-9b4d-be19fed08e44&)  The 20-minute film was created by Matt Spear, 23, of Martinsville, and Selena Hubbard, 22, of Greenwood. Both Spear and Hubbard studied Media Arts and Science , with an emphasis in video production, and graduated earlier this year from the Indianapolis campus. Hubbard and Spear co-wrote the film. Spear also directed and served as executive producer. Hubbard is cast member and served as film producer.  [Media Arts and Science](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/undergraduate/media-arts/)  “Three Months” tells the story of a man who puts off his dream. Now, after a cancer diagnosis, it may be too late. This film follows the themes of pursuing dreams and not pushing them off for another day.  The pair created the film for their senior year capstone project. With a few minor changes, they then submitted the film to be shown in the Heartland Film Festival, one of more 1600 films that were submitted for consideration.”  As they began working on the film, Hubbard and Spear decided they wanted the film to be about something that was personal and something to which they could relate.  One of the big themes in the films is about not being afraid to pursue your goals, because the time everyone has to do that is limited, Spear said. “We hope our film can be an inspiration to those students to take the risks needed to reach their biggest goals.”  “The cancer diagnosis is a way for the main character to realize you don’t have forever,” Spear said. “It is about life being short and you shouldn’t hold back on anything,” Hubbard said.  While Hubbard and Spear were hopeful that Heartland would accept the film, they still had doubts about their chances of success. But a faculty member in the Media Arts and Science department knew the two students had produced a great film.  “I knew early on that Matt and Selena had a good film in the works,” said Thomas Lewis , a lecturer in the Media Arts and Science department. “It was such a pleasure to see it take shape over the course of the semester. To have Three Months get accepted into the Heartland Film Festival is almost as rewarding for me as I can imagine it is for them. It makes me extremely proud to see students of mine produce a great film and get the recognition they deserve.”  [Thomas Lewis](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/thomas-lewis/)  “As we worked on the capstone, we set some goals and one of the goals was to have the film shown beyond school,” Spear said. “Our goal was to submit it to a film festival and the Heartland was our first choice,” Hubbard said.  Spear received an email last August while sitting in a Media Arts and Science department class that Heartland would screen the film. “I kind of smiled, got on my phone and texted Selina.”  “I was so excited,” Hubbard said. “Somebody else watched it and wanted to show it to lots of people.”  “It was very definitely exciting to know that a project we made for school was going beyond that, that other people outside IUPUI saw it and thought it was good and worth being part of a festival that is international,” Spear said.  Spear and Hubbard credit the School of Informatics and Computing for preparing them to make a festival-worthy film. “We wouldn’t know how to make these films without getting the knowledge from our classes,” Hubbard said.  “The school was a great environment,” Spear said. “The classes in Media Arts and Sciences are project based, providing students with experience in different areas of filmmaking. The program is definitely geared toward experience and getting people out there and ready for the real world.”  Hubbard and Spear have submitted the film for entry into five other film festivals, including one in Berlin and another in California. Meanwhile, the two have formed Creative Pear, a business in which they will work on video projects and  additional films.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Book explores teen novels’ portrayals of autism to help libraries choose wisely  September 21, 2015  A new book detailing teen novels that feature characters with autism will help libraries select books that help young readers understand the disorder and foster acceptance, says one of the three authors, an associate professor at IUPUI.  “Autism in Young Adult Novels: An Annotated Bibliography” identifies novels published between 1968 and 2013 that have autism content and evaluates how the lives of characters with autism are portrayed, said Rachel Applegate , chair of the Department of Library and Information Science in the School of Informatics and Computing .  [Rachel Applegate](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/rachel-applegate/)  [Department of Library and Information Science](https://luddy.iupui.edu/lis/)  [School of Informatics and Computing](https://luddy.iupui.edu/)  “This is a book that focuses on the autism spectrum, and there hasn’t been anything like it before,” she said  The target audience for the book is librarians who will be able to use it to select high-quality, engaging novels that positively and accurately portray autism and use those works to educate young adults about the disorder, Applegate said.  Awareness of autism has grown significantly, but teens often don’t know much about it, the authors said. With greater awareness and understanding comes greater acceptance, they said.  A second author is Marilyn Irwin, a retired IUPUI library and information science associate professor who began work on the book in 2010. Her research interests focused on literature for youth and disabilities. The third author is Annette Y. Goldsmith, a lecturer in the University of Washington Information School.  In the first section of the book, the authors analyze how characters with autism spectrum disorder are presented. They ask questions such as:  This discussion is followed by a comprehensive bibliography.  The three authors read nearly 400 novels to write the book. They found the books through keyword searches in publishers’ catalogs, including Amazon’s, and asked for suggestions through librarian listservs.  “It was an eye-opening experience,” Applegate said. “As a whole, the novels contained a surprisingly small number of stereotypes, and the characters tend to have a better life than often occurs in real life.”  One novel was written by a young man with autism, Applegate said. “One thing I remember from that book is that every adult talking to the child character who had autism seemed to be shouting, screaming at the child. I wondered if that’s what people with autism perceive day to day, that people are shouting at them, because they are very sensitive to things like noise.”  Courtesy: Rich Schneider, IU Communications Specialist   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Media intern gives assist to professional soccer team Indy Eleven  August 10, 2022  Mark Ostermeier had been following the Indy Eleven , Indiana’s professional soccer team, since 2014, so when it came to finding an internship during his senior year at the IU School of Informatics and Computing (SoIC) at IUPUI he took his shot.  [Indy Eleven](https://www.indyeleven.com/)  Ostermeier chose the School and the Media Arts and Science program because he observed media production was an ever-growing field. “With media production growing at the rate it is I knew I would be able to find a job quickly. As someone who spends time on the internet I have always been fascinated by content creation and wanted to learn how to do that myself,” he said.  [Media Arts and Science](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/undergraduate/media-arts/)  When he saw the opportunity for a media internship at Indy Eleven posted on a job site he applied. His duties included being in charge of capturing content—mainly video—for pre-season, practice, and regular season activities for the team and also shot interviews with different sponsors. “This experience has helped me take what I have learned in the classroom and use that knowledge in a real-world setting,” Ostermeier said. “I feel as though what I have learned in my past three and a half years at IUPUI has been vital, but it is a different skill to transfer the knowledge I have acquired into a professional setting.”  As a student Ostermeier was selected to receive an RJE Knoll Internship Scholarship , open to SoIC undergraduates who pursue an internship that is not otherwise financially supported. “I chose this scholarship because I knew it would be a great learning experience from being behind the camera to being in full on marketing meetings that I can actively participate in.”  [RJE Knoll Internship Scholarship](https://luddy.iupui.edu/cost-financial-aid/scholarships/)  Since Indy Eleven does not have a position open in the field he is in, Ostermeier plan to find a job in the media marketing field.  “One main piece of advice I would give to students seeking an internship is do not be afraid of the commitment. When I first started I did not know what was expected of me, nor did I even know what I would be doing. The first day of my internship I went through my previous work with everyone on the team and they helped fit me into their system and it was a blast. It did not feel like work because I enjoyed what I was doing and who I was around,” Ostermeier said.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Dr. Brad Doebbeling’s paper accepted into AMIA 2014  November 7, 2014  Dr. Brad Doebbeling, chair of the BioHealth Informatics Department, has co-written a paper that has been accepted to the AMIA 2014 Annual Symposium.    Doebbeling, the primary investigator of a $2 million grant for Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), the first on the campus, and in the state of Indiana, is providing a patient-centered focus to research done here at IUPUI.  The paper, titled Patient-Centered Appointment Scheduling Using Agent-Based Simulation, co-written by Dr. Doebbeling with Ayten Turkcan, PhD, assistant professor of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering at Northeastern University, and Tammy Toscos, PhD, an assistant professor of health informatics at Indiana University–Purdue University Fort Wayne (IPFW), and Parkview Research Center, is an effort to show that primary care clinics should consider implementing scheduling options tailored to their population needs. The paper demonstrates the value of simulation models in improving access to care through scheduling.    “We wanted to bring the patient into the research and work with clinics to create convenient tools that they can use, to check appointment availability, to view the provider information, so that they don’t have unnecessary trips to the emergency room, and out of pocket expenses,” said Doebbeling. “IUPUI and Indianapolis is one of the few places in the world where innovation comes together with cutting edge health care delivery and innovative technology development, where groundbreaking research can take place.”  Doebbeling has been an advocate for the role of informatics in informing evidence-based practice and driving system change. His work lays the groundwork for the Learning Healthcare System, through its focus on partnership, teamwork, collaboration and using HIT and data effectively to drive system transformation.  AMIA (the American Medical Informatics Association) is a professional scientific association and the academic home for informatics.  The AMIA 2014 Annual Symposium received 1,085 submissions in all categories for this year’s Symposium in Washington, DC. Submitted manuscripts, proposals, and abstracts were carefully reviewed by at least three selected expert referees.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Love of history and public service leads LIS grad to US Copyright Office  October 11, 2023  (photo provided by David Fiora)  After starting the Library and Information Science master’s program (MLIS) at Luddy Indianapolis in 2021, David Fiora became aware of the Junior Fellows Program at the US Library of Congress from a classmate. He then learned about the copyright metadata capture project that was being conducted by the US Copyright Office, which he felt best reflected his skills and interest as a library professional and was his top project choice. The project, which began at the end of May, was full-time and fully-remote, allowing Fiora to work out of his home in Cincinnati, Ohio.  [Library and Information Science master’s program (MLIS)](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/masters/mlis/)  Fiora, who graduated at the end of the summer 2023 semester, said that library information science reflects the skills and interests that he has, specifically the opportunity to interact with history, continual learning for both yourself and the people you interact with, and the opportunity to perform public service in a meaningful way.  Fiora’s interest in library information science started when he interned at White Water Shaker Village as a history undergraduate student. The internship turned out to be archives-focused and through this experience he began to realize he enjoyed the work that he was doing. After this internship was over, he began to strongly consider his academic and professional future.  When considering his career, he met with professors, and library and archive professionals to learn about their professional and academic experiences and how they continued to develop and learn. “Through this learning experience, I realized that the best path forward for me academically was to pursue a master’s degree in library and information science, as the wide variety of career opportunities reflected my interest in this field, but also because I was not totally sure what type of job I wanted to have in the future. During my two years of graduate school, my goals for my professional future have evolved and changed significantly through my classwork and professional experiences.”  Fiora chose Luddy as he felt confident in the professors through his initial interactions. “Being from Cincinnati, I felt very familiar with and comfortable attending Indiana University for graduate school. I’ve spent so much time in Indiana and had known about Indiana University that it felt very natural to attend IU for this graduate program even though it was fully remote. I liked the idea of visiting the Indianapolis campus when I wanted to, as it was only two hours away. The lower price point for the Indianapolis campus made it very affordable to attend and furthered my interest and desire in pursuing this opportunity immediately after graduating with my bachelor’s degree. Also, it turned out that there was a scholarship for students from the Cincinnati area, although I didn’t know about this prior to applying and starting classes,” Fiora said.   ### Working in the US Copyright Office  Fiora’s job in the copyright card catalog metadata capture project was that of quality assurance as a first level reviewer for metadata that was extracted from the catalog cards of historical copyright registration records dating prior to 1977. This work involved him fixing errors and inconsistencies that resulted from the optical character recognition used to extract the data, and due to human error when the cards were written. It also involved him researching copyright records at times to determine what the right answer for a problem is. He also assisted the copyright office by developing training guides and learning manuals that will be used in the copyright card catalog metadata capture project. This work has helped to improve the searchability and overall quality of the copyright records in the Copyright Public Records System, the catalog of copyright public records the US Copyright Office is in the process of developing.  He said he has learned so much about the technical services side of librarianship through this project. “This project provided me great insight into the world of copyright law, metadata, contracts, database management, the research process, extensible markup language, and instruction design. I’ve also learned so much about the work that the Library of Congress does, and important skills about how to be a professional in the world today. The Library of Congress has done a great job mixing hands-on practical experience and giving lessons to interns about how to prepare their job search, recognizing that we are emerging professionals,” Fiora said.  “Attending library school gave me the knowledge needed to have the confidence to pursue this opportunity. Although I was just working at the public library and had only been introduced to the world of librarianship a few years prior, I felt that my time, skills, and knowledge learned from library school gave me the ability to obtain this highly sought after opportunity. My class work focused on the archival sciences and technical services side of librarianship helped me to gain the knowledge needed to be prepared for my time in the copyright office.  “My advisor Denise Rayman was very helpful in pursuing this opportunity. She has been great at providing encouragement, giving recommendations about how I can continue my growth, and always being there when I have questions about being a library professional. Lydia Spotts was also very important in my preparation for this opportunity; the archival focus classes that she taught were the foundation upon which I was able to get this opportunity.”  [Denise Rayman](https://luddy.iupui.edu/contact/profile/denise-rayman)  [Lydia Spotts](https://luddy.iupui.edu/contact/profile/lydia-spotts)   ### Future plans and advice for others  Fiora plans on pursuing a technical services-focused librarianship opportunity in his future. It is his goal to work in an academic library, helping students to achieve their goals. He also has an interest in working in an archives-focused position, based on his prior experiences. He said his time being an intern for the Library of Congress has also inspired an interest to continue working for the federal government.  His advice to other prospective library science students is: Never let an opportunity pass you by, growth happens when you get out of your comfort zone, don’t be afraid to take risks, you never know where an opportunity will lead you to. “I never would have expected that I would be a participant in the Junior Fellows program at the Library of Congress, but I am forever grateful that I took this risk and went for an opportunity that will positively change my professional future,” Fiora said. “Pursuing this opportunity was a risk for myself, as it meant leaving a full-time position in the public library. But in order to grow and continue to develop my skills, I knew it was necessary to move on and pursue this opportunity. Throughout my time in library school, I have always tried to pursue every single opportunity that has been made available to me, from participating in student organizations, professional organizations, attending learning opportunities, and going to library conferences in person. I feel that all these experiences have made my time in library school more well-rounded and have complemented the classwork that I have done. Moving forward in my professional future, I plan to continue to never let an opportunity to increase my skills and capabilities and librarianship pass me by, as I never know where it’ll lead me to for the better.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Graduate students gain hands-on experience designing online tools for alcohol/drug recovery programs  January 13, 2012  Josette Jones, associate professor of Health Informatics, and graduate students Van Hemmerlein, Juma Magere, Justin Snodgrass and Troy Tucker teamed with White Pine Systems, LLC, during the fall 2011 semester, to design requirements for online tools that help recovery coaches work with men and women with drug and alcohol problems.  “We are thrilled to have had the opportunity to work with this excellent team,” said Doug Dormer, White Pine’s founder and CEO. “Following our Care Unit Method, the team interviewed industry leaders and reviewed literature to develop an excellent Care Unit Analysis that expresses the unique requirements around substance abuse. Based on this important work, White Pine is now delivering a patient portal for one of the leading substance abuse organizations in the United States.”  White Pine’s patient portal system (called SPINN – the Secure and Personal Information and Notification Network) is organized around Care Units, resulting in a user experience that is easier, quicker and more relevant for each patient and caregiver. Examples of Care Units include diabetes, COPD, hypertension, pregnancy, cancer, pediatrics and substance abuse.  The Substance Abuse Care Unit includes a number of features appropriate to substance abuse recovery that are not found in other patient portals. The Substance Abuse Care Center follows similar work by White Pine and IUPUI around other care units including diabetes, hypertension, juvenile obesity and pediatrics.  “Through the collaboration with White Pine, our students gain real-world, first-hand experience,” Jones said. “With the ability to view their personal health information and share it with trusted healthcare providers and coaches, people will be empowered to make more informed decisions about their health and the health of their families.”         ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## School of Informatics and Computing faculty receive Google Research Award  January 4, 2011  Faculty at the School of Informatics and Computing are recipients of a $50,000 Google Research Award in support of their work exploring the semantic and cognitive value of non-speech sound.  The award will fund a one-year project using short but complex collages of sound effects and music – referred to as “audemes” – to supplement K-12 textbooks and develop audeme-based games for students at the Indiana School for the Blind and Visually Impaired.  Audemes and audeme sequences serve as powerful mnemonic prompts that leverage the innate human ability to recognize, remember and interpret the world as a “soundscape” of aural signs.  The one-year project is led by School of Informatics and Computing professors Steve Mannheimer, M.F.A., and Mathew Palakal, Ph.D. It builds upon three years of previous research with students at the Indiana School for the Blind and Visually-Impaired. That work, funded by a grant from the Nina Mason Pulliam Charitable Trust, found that audemes significantly enhance students’ ability to imprint and recall academic information.  The current Google-funded project engages students in further exploration of how sounds can combine to form new meanings with greater semantic richness than names or verbal labels. The Indiana School for the Blind and Visually-Impaired will continue to serve as a partner in the testing and evaluation of the research. Mannheimer and Palakal hope to incorporate their findings into a rich “audeme dictionary” of particular use to students whose primary sensory channel is auditory.  But the project may eventually have even broader applications. Mannheimer and Palakal believe that audemes and non-speech sound in general represent an under-utilized platform for cognition and interface design, especially as consumer technologies offer greater multimedia capabilities, handheld devices with small screens become increasingly popular for accessing information, and books, including student textbooks, evolve onto digital platforms.  Google Research Awards are a reflection of Google’s commitment to the support and development of new research and technologies emerging from university faculty. The awards are given annually to academic institutions and researchers worldwide pursuing innovative research aimed at improving information access.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

To better understand and appreciate libraries and the roles they have played throughout the history of civilizations, one may turn to the study of ‘Library History.’ This course traces the development and evolution of libraries from the ancient world to the modern, with an emphasis on the macrocultural forces shaping libraries within each specific tradition. Library traditions in both Eastern and Western cultures are explored.   ### Program Learning Goals Supported  Instructors map their courses to specific LIS Program Goals . Mapped program goals drive the design of each course and what students can expect to generally learn.  [LIS Program Goals](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/masters/mlis/program-goals.html)   ### Learning Outcomes  Instructors develop learning outcomes for their courses. Students can expect to be able to achieve the learning outcomes for a given course after successfully completing the course.   ### Course Overview  Instruction is in Canvas. Lessons are organized into Modules whose length may vary.  Module 1: Why Study Library History?  Module 1 sets into motion the conversations we will have throughout the entire semester by setting the context of Library History within the field of Library & Information Science. We examine the scope, breadth, and focus of Library History, as a discipline, and then explore its relevance to contemporary degree programs.  By the end of this module, you will be able to answer the following questions:  Module 2: The Power of Libraries as Cultural Heritage Institutions  Module 2 provides an important theoretical paradigm that we will use throughout this course: i.e., Understanding libraries as ‘cultural heritage institutions.’ In particular, we examine how cultural heritage institutions structure how one interacts with information and cultural artifacts, and – through this interaction – reinforce cultural identity. We also examine the definition of library , and how these institutions have been used as tools to reinforce and/or undermine dominant cultural narratives.  By the end of this module, you will be able to answer the following questions:  Module 3: Mesopotamia and Egypt  Module 3 focuses on Mesopotamia and Egypt, allowing us to explore the earliest examples we currently have of library traditions. We investigate the primary cultural conditions that have often influenced the birth and development of libraries, including 1. Social conditions, 2. Economic conditions, and 3. Political conditions. This module also covers the origin of writing systems and how those influence the manifestations of unique library traditions.  By the end of this module, you will be able to answer the following questions:  Module 4: Greece and Rome  Module 4 allows us to explore the library traditions unique to the Greco-Roman world. We also begin investigating the role of professional librarians, as well as the development of bibliographic practices. This module also covers the topic of ‘public libraries’ and how public has been defined differently within different traditions.  By the end of this module, you will be able to answer the following questions:  Module 5: East Asia  Module 5 shifts our discussion away from Western traditions by introducing us to the earliest examples of libraries, librarians, and library classifications that arose in East Asia. While the primary focus of this module is on the birth, development, evolution, and knowledge-classifications of libraries in ancient China, we will also cover aspects of Japanese libraries. We examine the role religion and philosophy, especially Buddhism, played in the formation of East Asian libraries and their collections.  By the end of this module, you will be able to answer the following questions:  Module 6: South Asia  Module 6 continues our examination of Eastern library traditions as we shift our focus to South Asia and the native library traditions of India. Again, we examine the role religion and philosophy, especially Buddhism, played in the formation of South Asian libraries and their collections.  By the end of this module, you will be able to answer the following questions:  By the end of Module 6, you will also be able to complete your first major synthesis of course content and compare/contrast the birth and unique manifestations of ancient library traditions within both Eastern and Western cultural contexts.  Module 7: Byzantium and Islam  Module 7 shifts our focus to Eastern Europe and the Middle East. In particular, we look at 1. Greek influence on the continued evolution of libraries within what became known as the Eastern Roman Empire (or Byzantine Empire); 2. The role Orthodox Christianity played in the establishment of later-Byzantine libraries; and 3. The influence that the rise and spread of Islam had on the birth of an entirely new and highly sophisticated culture of learning and its accompanying library tradition. We also begin to explore the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5 th century of the common era and the impact that had on literature, learning, and libraries.  By the end of this module, you will be able to answer the following questions:  Module 8: Charlemagne, Monasteries and Cathedrals  Module 8 covers roughly the same time period as Module 7 (i.e., Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages), but the emphasis shifts to the historical trajectory of the geographical area that formerly comprised the Western Roman Empire. We will cover the immense influence the early Roman Catholic Church had on the evolution of libraries during this period, while taking deep-dives into the importance of monastic and cathedral libraries. We also examine the role Charlemagne and his cultural renaissance had on writing, literature, learning, and libraries.  By the end of this module, you will be able to answer the following questions:  By the end of Module 8, you will also be able to complete your second major synthesis of course content and 1. Provide an overview of how religion has been tied to the development of specific library traditions from the ancient world to the medieval; and 2. Compare and contrast how libraries have been connected to or influenced by religious traditions in at least two different cultural contexts.  Module 9: High Middle Ages, Universities, & the Renaissance  Module 9 continues our discussion of the evolution of libraries within Western Europe by examining the technological innovations of the High Middle Ages; the intellectual needs accompanying the birth of universities; and the near cult-like status that classical learning, classical authors, and classical literature held during the late-Medieval Renaissance. In this module, the core focus is on the shift from Church-controlled library collections to the establishment of secular, academic libraries.  By the end of this module, you will be able to answer the following questions:  Module 10: Medieval Asia  Module 10 gives us the opportunity to shift our focus back to native Asian library traditions by exploring India, China, and Japan during the same period as that previously covered in Western Medieval Europe. We cover the changing sociocultural and political landscapes of these areas, and how these changes impacted the growth, spread, and use of libraries and their collections.  The continued influence of Eastern religious and philosophical thought (e.g., Buddhism, Hinduism, Confucianism, etc.), as well as the spread of Islam into South Asia, are also covered.  By the end of this module, you will be able to answer the following questions:  By the end of Module 10, you will also be able to complete your third major synthesis of course content and compare/contrast the unique manifestations of medieval library traditions within both Eastern and Western cultural contexts.  Module 11: Gutenberg and the Early Modern World  Module 11 examines the role Gutenberg and the printing revolution of Western Europe had on the development and function of Early-Modern libraries. The rise and influence of royal and national libraries are also covered during this period.  By the end of this module, you will be able to answer the following questions:  Module 12: Industrialization, Education, & Modern Libraries in Europe  Module 12 shifts our focus from the Early-Modern to the Modern world, and we examine the contributions that industrialization, education, literacy rates, and economics had on the establishment of modern libraries. The infancy of the Anglo-American ‘public’ library model is introduced.  By the end of this module, you will be able to answer the following questions:  Module 13: Americas  Module 13 continues the discussion introduced in Module 12 but shifts the geographical focus to the Americas, primarily covering the United States and Canada during the colonial and modern periods. The Anglo-American public library model is explored in greater detail, and we explore how the term public is not universal but – rather – context specific. We also take a deep-dive into the ways modern public libraries have been used as instruments of the state and how different models of government with their own governing principles impacted the collections and usage of public libraries. North American academic libraries are also covered in relation to their predecessors.  By the end of this module, you will be able to answer the following questions:  By the end of Module 13, you will also be able to complete your fourth major synthesis of course content and 1. Think critically on and evaluate your own biases of how public libraries should look/operate; 2. Compare/contrast different manifestations of public library traditions within different contexts/periods; and 3. Compare/contrast the importance of books/libraries in the development of Europe’s earliest universities and the earliest universities founded in colonial America.  Module 14: Modern Asia  Module 14 examines library traditions as they appear within Modern Asia, again focusing primarily on India, China, and Japan. This module allows students to take a deep-dive into the phenomenon of colonialism and how libraries have been and continue to be used as instruments of colonial hegemony. In particular, we examine how 1. Western standards of Library & Information Science have been imposed on native Asian library traditions, and 2. Chinese colonialism has eradicated the native library tradition of Tibet.  By the end of this module, you will be able to answer the following questions:  By the end of Module 14, you will also be able to complete your fifth major synthesis of course content and 1. Provide a detailed analysis of the similarities/differences between libraries in Western Europe, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, the Americas, and different regions of Asia; 2. Provide a detailed analysis of the similarities/differences between Eastern and Western libraries across the Ancient, Medieval, Early-Modern, and Modern worlds; and 3. Identify and deconstruct colonial practices within Library & Information Science.  Module 15: Library Science & the Rise of a Profession  Module 15 briefly covers the rise of Library Science as an academic discipline and profession. It also allows us to return to the first questions asked in Module 1 and reflect upon our original answers:   ### Policies and Procedures  Please be aware of the following linked policies and procedures.

    "body": "  ## LIS-S 557 Marketing for Libraries  3 credits  [schedule](https://sisjee.iu.edu/sisigps-prd/web/igps/course/search/)   ### Description  Marketing is much more than creating attractive displays and updating your Facebook page, it’s about meeting the needs of individuals and groups. If library users aren’t aware of your resources and services they’re unlikely to visit your physical or virtual library. If they’ve had a bad experience in the past, they may be sharing this negativity with their friends and colleagues. Marketing is about understanding the needs and interests of current and potential users, reaching those individuals with quality resources and services, and evaluating the experience so adjustments can be made to increase effectiveness, efficiency, and appeal.   ### Program Learning Goals Supported  Instructors map their courses to specific LIS Program Goals . Mapped program goals drive the design of each course and what students can expect to generally learn.  [LIS Program Goals](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/masters/mlis/program-goals.html)     ### Learning Outcomes  Instructors develop learning outcomes for their courses. Students can expect to be able to achieve the learning outcomes for a given course after successfully completing the course.   ### Course Overview  Instruction is in Canvas. Lessons are organized into Modules whose length may vary.  Module 1: Marketing for Libraries  Marketing is the process of creating a connection between the users and the library. The library must demonstrate its value in meeting a customer’s need.  Module 2: Market Research and the Value of Libraries  Value is the benefit that a library user receives when using a product or service. Libraries can create value by offering the types of services that customers need in a way that is effective, efficient, and appealing.  Module 3: Audience Analysis and Needs Assessment  Patrons, customers, clients, users… this is the primary audience for our resources and services. However, we also have an internal audience. These are our stakeholders, board members, and staff members. Both play an important role in marketing.  Module 4: Market Segmentation  Library users are varied. Although it would be desirable for everyone in the potential audience to use the library, not every segment is a viable market for a particular library type. Effective market segmentation groups customers in ways that result in similarity within each segment and dissimilarity between each segment on relevant characteristics. Matching customers to the library’s mission and capabilities is vital.  Module 5: Product and Service Identification  Rather than trying to be all things to all people, today’s libraries are positioning their services to appeal to specific market segments.  Module 6: The Market Plan and Cycle  A marketing plan provides a structure for the activities of public relations, promotion, and the other elements associated with this process.  Module 7: Promotion  Promotion is used to gain participation by encouraging people to take advantage of library offerings.  Module 8: Message Design, Branding, and the Library’s Story  Each library and service has a story to tell. Design, develop, test, apply, and deliver informational, educational, and persuasive messages to meet specific communication needs. Branding involves establishing a link between the library and a logo/slogan/phrase and developing a profile that can be used to build loyalty.  Module 9: Public Relations  Public relations involves building long-term positive relationships between users and libraries.  Module 10: Publicity  Publicity is a way of communicating messages to the public.  Module 11: Advertising and Sponsorship  Advertising draws attention to the products and services available through announcements.  Module 12: Consultants  Whether it’s designing a logo or setting up a content management system, you may need to seek help in turning your vision into reality. In addition, many companies provide marketing resources at little or no charge to support library services.  Module 13: Outreach & Advocacy  Advocacy generates support for specific proposals or issues associated with libraries such as funding and privacy rights through getting people who have good opinions about the library to speak on its behalf about the value of the organization and its services.  Customer retention involves marketing aimed at developing and nurturing long-term relationships between the librarian and users.  Module 14: Internal Marketing  Conveying the value of the library to the board of trustees, administrators, or other stakeholders is an essential component of library marketing. In addition, allied departments, staff members, and volunteers also need buy-in.  Module 15: Measuring Impact and the Service Review  Conducting a service review involves examining all aspect of the marketing process and making changes based on evidence.  Module 16: Innovation and Change  Marketing requires creativity and an open mind. New services and marketing strategies come from libraries who are innovators and agents of change.   ### Policies and Procedures  Please be aware of the following linked policies and procedures.

    "body": "  ## Media Arts & Science Students and Faculty Go Behind the Scenes of Pixar During Trip to San Francisco  April 6, 2015  Zeb Wood and Travis Faas, both lecturers in the media arts and science (MAS) program in the School of Informatics and Computing, along with 11 students, recently traveled to San Francisco, California as part the Game Developers Conference (GDC).    The GDC, now in its 29 th year, has grown from the informal gathering of a small group of developers to what it is today hosting over 24,000 game development professionals, and being the primary forum for those involved in the development of interactive games, to gather and exchange ideas and shape the future of the industry. The conference featured over 400 lectures, panels, tutorials and round-table discussions.  As an added surprise, Wood coordinated a visit with MAS alum Frank Tai, a studio artist for Pixar since he graduated in 2008. “Working for Pixar is a dream job – One that many students in the media arts and science program aspire to. So this was a great opportunity to visit the Pixar studios and for the students to meet a graduate of the program. It was good for them to get a real life view of what life is like in the industry,” said Wood.  AJ Shannon, Wen Krogg, Kevin Jethrow, Stafa Al-Hassani, all undergrads in the MAS program, were the students selected to accompany Wood and Faas on their visit to Pixar and with Tai.  The group was able to tour the Pixar grounds and learn about production operations.  They learned about work flow and volume, working on several films at once, as well as pre-production art and the life of studio artists – Everything from eating habits, workouts, yoga, to what it’s like on-the-job.  After the tour, they were able to have dinner and some one-on-one conversation with Tai. “When you watch a Pixar movie, it is normal to dream of one day working there, but to meet someone who was once a student just like me, that is actually working there, it’s like meeting a famous actor. Being able to spend time with him, getting his insight and knowing that he took the time to share his experience with us was one of the best memories of the trip,” said Shannon.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Dean’s Corner-Winter 2021 Newsletter  April 19, 2022  Greetings, alumni and friends.  As usual, another academic year has passed all too quickly and is coming to a close. Despite the pandemic, we returned with full energy, excitement, and enthusiasm and have made some important and exciting additions to our degree and certificate offerings this past year. These include a new Bachelor of Arts in Artificial Intelligence and three undergraduate certificates that are part of the State of Indiana’s Next Level Jobs initiative, as well as a Virtual Production Certificate. And we’ve added a new Study Abroad in Finland, led by LIS and MAS faculty, Bill Helling and Travis Faas.  I also want to welcome our new Assistant Dean,  Amy Maidi, to the SoIC family. Amy comes to us with a wealth of experience in all things student services at both IU Bloomington and IUPUI and we are excited to have her here with us now.  The Polis Center completed its move to the IT building last summer while we were all quarantining and is fully operational in their fourth floor home now. We are able to partner and offer our students and faculty so many great research opportunities as a result.  I am pleased to report that our 72 percent of our faculty obtained a grand total of 32 grants for a total of $7,095,785 in 2021.  Speaking of opportunities, many of our students have participated in and won local tech challenges this past year. They were especially successful at the ATT 5G Sports Challenge (see story below) last fall, where six teams received awards, including the overall prize. These competitions showcase our students’ exemplary skills and talents and give them a chance to make a difference with their human-centered tech solutions.  Finally, as you may know, declining high school populations and the ongoing effects of the pandemic, among other factors, have slowed enrollment in higher ed. Although we have managed to persevere with strong growth at the graduate level , it is imperative that we continue to reach out to prospective students, especially undergraduates, in order to thrive. Please continue to spread the word about our programs, our school, and our IUPUI campus.  Best wishes for good health and continued success,  Mathew   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Fulbright scholar William Helling takes Library and Information Science international  December 20, 2019  School of Informatics and Computing faculty William “Bill” Helling is a true polyglot, speaking some level of four languages in addition to his native English, and is also fully conversant in using technology to create and develop international community in Library and Information Science (LIS). In January 2020, the second-time Fulbright scholar will be heading back to Haaga-Helia University in Helsinki, Finland to further develop instructional methods, materials, and content, while conducting a class simultaneously across both campuses.  [William “Bill” Helling](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/william-helling/)  [Library and Information Science](https://luddy.iupui.edu/lis/)  [Haaga-Helia University](http://www.haaga-helia.fi/en/frontpage)  Helling first visited Haaga-Helia in 2013 when he received his first Fulbright scholarship. There he taught on improving business services with information technology, and developed an asynchronous online course at IUPUI that he combined with a face-to-face class in Finland. He says that conducting one class across two campuses was beneficial for all students because of the exchange of ideas and perceptions. “This was an opportunity for American students to work with different cultures on common concerns; Haaga-Helia students profited likewise because of their interactions with American students,” Helling says.  On this trip, he will build on the connections he made in 2013 and expand his relationships with faculty and staff there and elsewhere in Finland. He will also lay the groundwork for the Finland Study Abroad program that he and Andrea Copeland , the chair of the LIS Department, hope to initiate in the next couple of years.  [Andrea Copeland](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/andrea-copeland/)  “For the Department of Library and Information Science, international interaction is difficult to achieve but necessary to keep this discipline truly global, so that it addresses the needs of worldwide users.”  Helling began his lengthy career at the University of Kansas teaching college-level foreign language, having earned a Ph.D in French, but found himself returning to school to earn an MIS degree at Indiana University. He then worked for IDG books and as a public librarian before becoming an adjunct instructor at IU Bloomington and IUPUI. His interest in instructional technology and his professional experience eventually led to his current full-time position in the Department of Library and Information Science.  His study of French, German, Spanish, and Finnish, and his multiple travels abroad have served Helling in dealing with information architecture as he examines how to accommodate the international user experience on websites and the labels, both textual and iconic, that are used to convey information to web users. For example, Europeans often study and understand British English as opposed to American English, which can lead to confusion if not taken into account, as so much web content is created by native speakers from the U.S.  “My international experiences have helped me understand my need for cultural sensitivity as well as the need to take responsibly my role as a cultural ambassador.”  Helling has published and presented on a variety of topics, such as film interpretations of literature and French 19th-century exploration of Australia, and has much experience in library system software, including compatibility with RFID and integration with eBooks and similar third-party services. He is also an expert in digitization of library historical resources as well as website usability and accessibility.  “Dr. Helling’s work in cross-cultural education is just one of the many ways that our department benefits from his unique set of expertise and lived experiences. The LIS community is excited for him and can’t wait to see what comes next,” Copeland says.   ### About the Fulbright Scholar Program  The Fulbright Scholar Program was established in 1946 under legislation introduced by then-Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas. The Fulbright Program is sponsored by the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs and awards approximately 8,000 grants annually.

    "body": "  ## Network with LinkedIn  LinkedIn is a professional networking resource that is increasingly used by employers and recruiters to find potential candidates. It also is a space for candidates to find employers and build a professional network. LinkedIn is NOT Facebook. The connections you make on LinkedIn should be people who can potentially make introductions for you, or for whom you could make introductions. Be selective about who you add to your professional network.  [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/)   ### Complete Your Profile  When building your LinkedIn profile, be sure to make it as complete as possible. Complete profiles garner more views and therefore more opportunities.   #### Headline and Photo  Your headline should be a concise but descriptive branding statement that shows your current position and goals. The default headline is your current title, but you can customize it to reflect your brand and your aspirations. Unlike Facebook, you only get one photo on LinkedIn. Make sure the photo is a high-quality headshot of just you, professionally dressed.  Examples: “Media Arts & Science Junior Seeking Summer Internship”, “Future Video Game Developer & Designer, Luddy Indianapolis,” “Data Enthusiast Looking for Summer Internship Opportunities // Master of Data Science Candidate”, etc.  Make it memorable. It should help someone understand the role you want to do next and/or contain keywords important to your profession. You have 120 characters Your headline is NOT just “Student at IUPUI”.   #### Summary  It is important to craft your professional summary by including information about your work passions, skills, qualifications, goals, and interests. This is where you can include relevant work experience as well as non-academic involvement.  Write your summary in a first-person narrative and tell your story in a way that gives employers a quick glimpse of who you are and what you care about in your career.   #### Experience  Add your work history and involvement/volunteer roles, providing a thorough description of your work responsibilities, tasks performed, and key accomplishments and contributions. Your experience does not need to be paid or full time—you can include internships, part-time jobs, volunteer work, or extracurriculars. Include strategic key words and phrases that will stand out to recruiters.   #### Education  Include all the institutions you’ve attended and list your concentration, major, and/or minor. Include student organizations you are involved with on campus. Consider embedding class projects to showcase your work you’ve done in classes.   #### Skills and Endorsements  The skills section allows you to highlight the skills you have on your resume and any additional skills you feel you can bring to the table. Your network—those colleagues and friends who are familiar with your work—can “endorse” those skills, vouching for your professional abilities.   #### Projects  This section gives you the opportunity to highlight projects that you are particularly proud of and would like to bring to the attention of an employer. Put the project in context (class project, professional project, voluntary, etc.) and discuss your specific contributions. If you worked in a team, add the team members to the project listing.   #### Additional Considerations   ### Make Connections  When building your network, make connections with people you have met and interacted with—professors, supervisors, coworkers, peers, and others. Be sure to personalize the note when inviting someone to connect with you by reminding them where they met you or why you would like to connect.   ### Join Groups  You can join groups or associations based on your interests, connections, education, or industry, and these groups give you an opportunity to interact directly with professionals through ongoing group discussions. You will want to join and display membership in different groups on LinkedIn that are relevant to your job search and reflect your network. These groups appear at the bottom of your profile, which shows employers and your other connections that you are interested in engaging in the professional community. Join at least three “Groups” on LinkedIn–including the “ Luddy Indianapolis Career Services ” group.  There are alumni and current students there!  [Luddy Indianapolis Career Services](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luddy-indy-career-services/)   ### Search for Career Opportunities on Linkedin  After completing your profile, you can easily search for internships and full-time career opportunities on LinkedIn and narrow down your results using filters, keywords, and advanced search. Consider researching the companies and ways you can recognize and avoid fraudulent tactics before you apply.

[Epitranscriptomic code and its alterations in human disease](https://www.clinicalkey.com/#!/content/playContent/1-s2.0-S1471491418301497?returnurl=https:%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1471491418301497%3Fshowall%3Dtrue&referrer=https:%2F%2Fwww.cell.com%2Ftrends%2Fmolecular-medicine%2Ffulltext%2FS1471-4914(18)30149-7)  In their paper, Kadumuri and Janga surveyed and compiled the literature to date on RNA modifications — a field increasingly being referred to as epitranscriptomics — and summarized significant findings.  Additionally, they have proposed a new model for how genes are regulated in a cell.  RNA plays an important role in human health. Since many diseases — neurological diseases, developmental defects, multiple types of cancer — are directly due to “incorrect” forms of RNA, treatments targeting the components that modify RNA may offer new ways to fight these diseases.  In their paper, Kadumuri and Janga hypothesize that there may be more regulation of RNA protein production than previously thought. More than 160 unique RNA modifications have been documented to date. These modifications act like cellular traffic signals, turning access to RNA on or off.  “We are identifying the ‘traffic lights’ for every gene in a cell across the length of the gene so that we can uncover the code’s full potential. We’re also studying how it impacts other traffic lights in a gene,” Janga said. “In other words, we are developing experimental and computational methods to identify this code in human RNA.”  Kadumuri and Janga are currently generating data to extend their observations.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Informatics students and alumni take on the 48 Hour Film Project  July 21, 2010  Multiple students and alumni of the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI are participating in the 48 Hour Film Project, an international traveling film festival visiting Indianapolis July 30 through Aug. 1. They are forming teams to compete with other groups of Indiana-based video amateurs and professionals. The goal? To produce the best short film possible in 48 hours.  One such team is Pants Cannon Media, a team consisting of Kylee Wall, Joshua Fike and Katie Toomey, Aaron Whiteford and Jeremiah Nickerson, all Media Arts and Science graduates from the 2009 or 2010 classes. Like other teams, they hope to win the event’s top prize, which includes a trophy, a screening of their film at the 48HFP Awards Weekend, Hollywood’s premier screenwriting software and, of course, bragging rights.  The event kicks off at the Indianapolis Museum of Contemporary Art. Teams will draw a genre at random on Friday, July 30. They will also receive a character, a line of dialogue and a prop that must be incorporated into their film. Teams will then have 48 hours to script, shoot, edit and score their short film. Films will be screened at the Indianapolis Museum of Art’s Toby Theater on August 7th, with awards for categories including best film, best use of prop and best editing. In 2009, nearly 40,000 filmmakers made 3,000 films in 76 cities around the world as part of the 48 Hour Film Project.  Registration for the event remains open to teams throughout the month of July, and individuals can make posts on the website to be recruited by an existing team. Learn more at www.48hourfilm.com/indianapolis/.  UPDATE: Pants Cannon Media was awarded Best Musical Score in the 48 Hour Film Project competition for their fantasy-genre short film, “Cooper O’Brien and the Magical Moustache.” The Pants Cannon Media team also included Ricardo Laranja, a lecturer in the School of Informatics and Computing’ Media Arts and Science program.     ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

[Department of Library and Information Science](https://luddy.iupui.edu/lis/)  The MLIS is essential for leadership in public libraries and provides valuable management skills. It is also universally required for professionals in academic libraries.  Graduates of the Department of Library and Information Science MLIS program have been honored as Movers and Shakers by the Library Journal, earned national awards for their work, and achieved positions of prominence.  The Department of Library and Information Science specializes in fostering collaborative learning from a distance, and its MLIS degree is offered completely online, making it convenient and accessible for students.  “Our program has continued to expand enrollment and course offerings, with a 39% increase in new students over the past 5 years and two new specializations, digital curation and archives management.”  Andrea Copeland, Ph.D.   ### Meeting high standards  The ALA says its standards stress innovation, and encourage programs to take an active role in and concern for future developments and growth in the field. An accredited program has demonstrated a commitment to continuous review of its mission and goals, and to clearly defining student learning outcomes, and regularly revising the curriculum to keep it current.  Other curriculum requirements include:  The ALA notes, “Graduating from an ALA-accredited program provides flexibility in the types of libraries and jobs you can apply for and enhances career mobility. Many employers require an ALA-accredited master’s degree for professional level positions, and some states require an ALA-accredited degree to work as a professional librarian in public or school libraries.”     ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Chakraborty awarded NSF grant to develop AI approaches for identifying dynamic clinical data patterns, causal links in text  October 2, 2020    Sunandan Chakraborty , assistant professor of data science at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, recently received a $174, 332 CRII award from the National Science Foundation’s Division of Information and Intelligent Systems. The grant project, entitled “Capturing Dynamism in Causal Relationships: A New Paradigm for Relationship Extraction from Text” will use artificial intelligence (AI) to discover new clinical data patterns in vast repositories of text data.  [Sunandan Chakraborty](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/sunandan-chakraborty/)  Text mining is extensively used in medicine, health, economics, public policy, and journalism. This project aims to address public health and how changing climatic, political, and economic policies and conditions affect mental and physical health of populations in different geographic areas.  The AI technique has been used to convert large, unstructured text data into knowledge, but has been limited to capturing snapshots in time, rather than the dynamic nature inherent in knowledge. Findings may be conflicting, inconsistent, refuted, contradicted, or confirmed over time. This project intends, in particular, to look at any causal relationships, i.e., changes in one variable resulting from changes in another variable.  Chakraborty’s research will be used to discover little known symptoms and signals of the rare disease Sjögren’s Syndrome by mining research articles and clinical notes in order to target significant reduction of diagnosis time for this disease. This process can be used to study other diseases as well.  He is also collaborating with the CDC to “identify the latent connections between real-world events and mental health issues of the general population by mining and validating causal statements from scholarly medical text, news, and social media data.” The CDC investigators are particularly interested in detecting the causal effects of extreme weather conditions, e.g. heat wave, or drastic changes in the economy, e.g. sudden loss of jobs, on mental health issues.  Although Chakraborty and his colleagues originated this research prior to the current COVID-19 pandemic, they are now thinking about how this project can help in this and similar public health crises.  Davide Bolchini , chair of the Department of Human-Centered Computing and professor of human-centered computing at the School of Informatics and Computing, said, “Sunandan’s project is very timely and original, because it augments text mining with state-of-the art neural network approaches in order to drive more powerful tools that can extract hidden meaning from text data, especially clinical information. This is an exciting example of research that is advancing the fundamentals of computing while creating the basis to make a positive impact on public health.”  [Davide Bolchini](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/davide-bolchini/)   ### Acknowledgement  This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1948322.

[Ayoung Yoon](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/ayoung-yoon/)  [Andrea Copeland](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/andrea-copeland/)  Yoon and Copeland, co–principal investigators, received $355,816 for their project, “Data Reuse for Local Community.”  Their goal is to support community members’ data reuse by facilitating their connection with existing resources and data infrastructure. The project will address societal challenges in education, health, economic development, and environment to help members gain better access to stores of data being collected about their communities. Yoon and Copeland will focus on public libraries, which can play a role in facilitating community interaction.  In the past, data reuse research has been overwhelmingly focused on scientific and academic contexts, according to Yoon. “As the practice of data reuse is expanded, it is timely to investigate data reuse practices outside the academic context, particularly from community and citizen perspectives,” Yoon says.  The researchers will conduct interviews and surveys, collaborate with stakeholders to create theoretical models for data exchange and workflows, and develop educational resources for librarians. Partner organizations across the country will help the team connect with local data reusers in order to understand their needs, practices, and challenges.  Copeland says, “Most citizen science projects utilize citizens through their contribution of data to a large research dataset, but do not involve them in the complete research cycle. This project takes an important step in the direction of including citizens throughout the process.”  This project evolved from an earlier pilot study conducted by Yoon. She was able to address critical issues, most notably the lack of interaction between communities and libraries. Yoon and Copeland will attempt to identify other barriers through this project, in order to create a data workflow model and understand the role of public librarians in supporting community members in data reuse. They hope to create a collaborative data reuse culture by designing services and providing useful resources for librarians.  “I think this research has the potential to change the way public librarians provide access to data-rich resources and data services,“ says Copeland.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## $1M alumni gift to benefit School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI and IU Summer Theatre  January 22, 2020  Danita and Robert Forgey, longtime friends of the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI , have made a deferred gift in excess of $1 million to further fund several existing student scholarships at the school and to support the IU Summer Theatre program in Bloomington.  [School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI](https://luddy.iupui.edu/)  This represents the largest single philanthropic gift to the School of Informatics and Computing on the Indianapolis campus.  The Forgeys’ contribution of more than $700,000 will impact School of Informatics and Computing students through the Jan Ashton Health Information Management Scholarship, the Ruth Walker Health Informatics Graduate Scholarship and the Danita H. Forgey Scholarship in Health Information Management.  Funds are also earmarked for the Alvin and Nadine Givens iDEW Scholarship and the school’s general fund, with emphasis on diversity programs. “I’ve really been impressed with what they’ve done to get diversity in the tech workforce,” Danita Forgey said.  Senior Executive Associate Dean Mathew J. Palakal expressed his appreciation to the Forgeys for supporting student success at Indiana University: “This is an exciting year of growth for the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, and with the support of Danita and Robert Forgey, we will be able to do even more in the coming years.  “We are focused on the future and centered on inclusion, which is why I’m so pleased the Forgeys chose to fund the Alvin and Nadine Givens iDEW Scholarship,” Palakal said. “This is a program specifically created to bring minority, female and underrepresented students into the IT workforce pipeline, and this gift from the Forgeys will allow us to make our efforts in those key areas even stronger.”  Danita Forgey, who runs a coding and reimbursement consulting business, holds a Bachelor of Science in medical records administration and a Master of Information Science from the School of Informatics and Computing. She was director of the Health Information Administration program — now known as Health Information Management, or HIM — after the school took it over from the IU School of Allied and Health Sciences. The HIM program celebrated its 70th anniversary this year.  [Health Information Management, or HIM](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/undergraduate/him/)  “Informatics came along and accepted the program, and not only accepted but really supported it — helped it grow, and it’s doing very well in that school. So, I have gratitude to informatics,” she said. “I will add that I’m happy the school got accreditation for the health informatics master’s program.”  “I hope this helps with their recruitment to have those scholarships available to people, and it will also help with recruitment to be able to do that 4-plus-1 program for the HIM students. That’s another scholarship that’s available to them if they decide to go that route,” Danita Forgey said. The accelerated B.S.-plus-M.S. program allows completion of both the bachelor’s in Health Information Management and the master’s in Health Informatics in just five years.

She has also received distinguished member and professional achievement awards from the Indiana Health Information Management Association .  [Indiana Health Information Management Association](https://www.ihima.org/)  Robert Forgey, who earned a B.A. in history and a B.S. in accounting from IU Bloomington and pursued a career in accounting, fondly remembers summers as a child spent attending IU Summer Theatre performances with his family at the Brown County Playhouse, located in Nashville, Indiana. “I really enjoyed going in the summer — the old Brown County Playhouse back then was open air. Later, it did have a metal tin roof, and it rattled. I remember a play when it was raining so hard on the metal roof, you could not hear the dialogue.”  [IU Summer Theatre](https://theatre.indiana.edu/on-stage/summer-theatre/index.html)  The Forgeys have continued to attend shows in Bloomington since IU’s Summer Theatre was relocated to the campus in more recent years — next year will be the 70th anniversary of the university offering the Summer Theatre program — and now include several friends in their tradition.  “IU Summer Theatre has long been a beloved program within our Department of Theatre, Drama, and Contemporary Dance , and we’re deeply thankful for Danita and Robert’s generous support,” said Rick Van Kooten, executive dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. “Every summer, this program gives our theatre students the opportunity to work side-by-side with professional guest actors, so the performances are rigorous training opportunities as well as wonderful productions. Danita and Robert have a passion for the performing arts, and their generosity ensures that Southern Indiana will remain a summer destination for theatre.”  [Department of Theatre, Drama, and Contemporary Dance](https://theatre.indiana.edu/about/index.html)  Danita and Robert Forgey are members of the Indiana University President’s Circle and are dedicated fans of IU sports as well as loyal patrons of the IU theatre program.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Human-Computer Interaction Faculty and Students Recognized by Premiere International Conference on Computers for Accessibility  July 10, 2013  Professor Davide Bolchini and human-computer interaction doctoral students Tao Yang, Prathik Gadde and Robert Morse in the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, recently had their refereed full paper “Bypassing Lists: Accelerating Screen-Reader Fact-Finding with Guided Tours” accepted at the highly-selective 15th ACM SIGACCESS International Conference on Computers and Accessibility (ASSETS 2013).    The paper reports a study that reveals for the first time that blind and visually-impaired users using screen readers (software that reads aloud the content of a website) can find information on the web almost twice as fast when relying on linear rather than hierarchical navigation structures. The research contributes key evidence to augment the design of current and next-generation interactive systems that can empower blind and visually-impaired web users to access and browse web applications more quickly.  “Since the early days of the web, web applications have been heavily relying on organizing collections of information in hierarchical fashion through long indexes (e.g., list of links), because that is the easiest way for sighted users to browse large information sets” says Bolchini. “Unfortunately, this assumption does not hold for people who cannot use their eyes to quickly glance over an index to make an informed navigation decision. By observing blind users navigating a website with screen readers, we quickly realized that sifting back and forth through long indexes is one of the most frustrating hurdles they encounter every day when they browse the web. We were excited to discover that complementing an index with simpler, linear navigation patterns can tremendously augment the ability of screen reader users to quickly scan a collection of items, thus empowering them to find the desired information much faster than with current browsing mechanisms”.  This research is based upon work supported by the NSF grant on “Navigating the Aural Web” IIS-1018054, and has been conducted in collaboration with high-school students and teachers from the Indiana School for the Blind and Visually Impaired (ISBVI) in Indianapolis.  The paper will be presented at ASSETS in Bellevue, Washington October 21-23, 2013. ASSETS is the top research conference specializing in computing and information technologies to benefit people with disabilities and older adults.

[Register Internship](https://iupuisoic-fireform.eas.iu.edu/online/pageforms/index/89b57030-01dc-40f4-c4b2-08dac108dba4)   ### Internship Benefits   ### Register credit and non-credit internships  Whether you plan to earn course credit for your internship or not, make sure you complete our internship application. Notifying us of your non-credit internship can help us provide opportunities for future Luddy Indianapolis students.  When you submit your internship application for credit, you will also need to include a copy of the signed Internship Agreement form that both you and your internship site supervisor will need to review and sign.   #### International Students who have F-1 Status  If you are an international student with F-1 status, please refer to the information on Curricular Practical Training (CPT) eligibility as it pertains to your internship application process.   ### Frequently Asked Questions   ### What are credit internships?  Credit internships are structured internships that require a student to complete a course for college credit (3–6 credit hours). Internships that extend beyond one semester may be considered for additional credit hour registration in future semesters. Coursework for credit internship courses includes:  You may seek credit for paid or unpaid internships. It is up to the student to seek credit for curriculum fulfillment or in response to an employer requesting an internship to be taken for credit. Courses are taught via Canvas so in-class time is not required.   ### Can full-time employment and undergraduate research count for academic credit?  Full-time employment related to your degree and research may also be used for internship credit. Both are experiential learning within the industry where you are directly applying the skills you have learned in your program.   ### What is the pay for an internship?  We encourage employers to pay their interns. Pay can average $10–15 per hour with an overall range of $8–25+ per hour depending on major, industry, and demand.   ### What is the length of an internship?  Credit and non-credit internships typically last the duration of a summer, spring, or fall semesters, but may depend on dates set between the employer and student.   ### What are the working hours of an internship?   ### Is it required for me to register for my internship for a credit or non-credit internship course?  Yes, it is required! Once an internship is obtained, an internship form will need to be filled out. The mentoring supervisor will need to sign off on the form to acknowledge the internship and verify that all information is correct. You will be contacted with a course number for registration should your internship qualify for credit.  The student and site supervisor also must sign-off on the Internship Policy Acknowledgement and submit it on Canvas.  Non-Credit Internship Recording on Transcripts—INFO I490 Professional Practice  International students on visas are generally not eligible for non-credit internships.  Students may apply for a “Milestone” to be designated on their transcript for internships that are not taken for credit. Milestone internships are a good way to show experience on a transcript to employers or for applying to graduate programs. To obtain a Milestone designation, a student must fill out and return an internship form and indicate a Non-Credit Internship at the top of the form. This form must be submitted prior to the start of the internship.  All Milestone Internships must meet the minimum non-credit internship standards as stated on the form to be considered for transcript designation. Internships reported for credit will not be marked as Milestones. Credit-bearing internships are recorded as a course on the transcript under the appropriate internship course number upon registration.  All Milestone Internships must meet the minimum non-credit internship standards as stated on the form to be considered for transcript designation.   ### More info about internships  Master of Library & Information Science Internships  [Internship Reports](https://indiana.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/msteams_38f7ca/EnEZluAycXtNn70R7JtlYbwBIndCOloeTCgo7s8RoFq-_g?e=CF8m0Y)  Internship Reports "

    "body": "  ## Human-Computer Interaction Faculty Featured by Tech Site  March 24, 2014  Associate Professor of Human-Computer Interaction, Dr. Karl MacDorman, was recently interviewed by the technology news website, Slashdot.    Dr. MacDorman gave his thoughts on the uncanny valley theory, the idea that computer-animated characters evoke a negative reaction when they look and move almost, but not quite like actual human beings. He also discussed the uncanny valley’s negative effect on the appreciation of video games and how this phenomenon operates differently in video games than in other forms of media.  It isn’t a necessity to have humanlike characters in many video games for them to be effective and appealing to their audiences, but there are instances where the opposite it true. “There’s almost no control over how the characters are going to be viewed,” according to MacDorman. “Oftentimes you’re able to view them from any direction. You can rotate around the arena and look at the characters from different directions. There’s not the same control over the presentation, the posing, the lighting, how it’s rendered and so on that you would have in film, so I think the uncanny valley in theory could be a larger problem.”  MacDorman adds, “Our brains are extremely good at processing human faces and detecting emotions from facial expressions, so even the small imperfections won’t go unnoticed.  We’re over trained in observing humans, but if we became similarly over-trained in observing digital doubles, that too might help us overcome the uncanny valley.”  Slashdot is a site geared towards the technology field by providing news and expert commentary on the latest technology through informative, balanced, and even humorous articles.

[Albert William](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/albert-william/)  [Zebulun Wood](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/zeb-wood/)  According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature , “at least 8 million tons of plastic end up in our oceans every year  and make up 80% of all marine debris from surface waters to deep-sea sediments. Marine species ingest or are entangled by plastic debris, which causes severe injuries and deaths.”  [International Union for Conservation of Nature](https://www.iucn.org)  Team member Alex Nichols—now a senior in the MAS program—was mostly involved in the preproduction phase, working on many of the paintings and textures of city scenes, as well as textures of Mr. Bubbles, the turtle hero of the story.  “Creating a film that tells such an important and urgent story with very talented people from all around the globe, and all in the midst of a pandemic that forced us to work remotely for the entire project, was something to be very proud of, for all of us. It was the first project in my life that felt real and alive, and the first time I could see myself doing this sort of thing every day,” Nichols said.  Earlier, a larger project was initiated by Darrell Bailey, Ph.D., of the Purdue School of Engineering and Technology at IUPUI, in collaboration with Erland Hilden and Despina Moysidou of Gothenburg, Sweden who created a story and composed a musical. Bailey, a founding dean of the School of Informatics and Computing asked William to provide animation based on the story in the musical, which was also incorporated into the N441 class.  Albert said, ”Zeb (Wood) and I incorporated this project into our course to create “Mr. Bubbles and the Tangled Web”, which was a true international service learning project with potential for significant impact.”  “Mr. Bubbles and the Tangled Web” can be viewed here on Vimeo .

    "body": "  ## Human-Computer Interaction Faculty Member Awarded Patent for Medical System  March 17, 2014  Dr. Anthony Faiola,  associate  professor of human-computer interaction (HCI) and Dr. Simon C. Hillier, MD, professor of anesthesiology (Geisel School of Medicine, Dartmouth College) were recently awarded a US Patent for their new medical system invention: Medical Information Visualization Assistant System and Method (MIVA), #8,645,164.    MIVA will provide critical care physicians and nurses working in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a data visualization diagnostic tool for interpreting large and diverse patient datasets, transforming data into contextual information and knowledge suitable for rapid decision-support. The mobile function of MIVA will allow clinicians to collaborate with their ICU team regardless of location, in or outside the critical care area.  Dr. Faiola is currently working on a third clinical study with the product. In the first two studies, clinical participants showed positive results, noting that MIVA provided added data visualization points without the need to review traditional paper charts, was consistent with clinical practice, provided external representations of activities for clues about group coordination, and was a solution to resolve conflicts about interpreting others’ activity. In summary, participants agreed that MIVA provided a unique analytical perspective and a broader context of real-time ICU experiences and human activity that could significantly impact clinical decision-support.  Dr. Faiola received considerable help from his team of Research Associates during the Phase-Two Funding period, which was supported by a grant from the IUPUI Solution Center (ISC). This included the work of Robert Comer and Christine Newlon, who authored the interface code and database back-end architecture, both from the School of Informatics and Computing. Dr. Atif Zafar, MD, Professor at the Indiana University School of Medicine and Physician of Internal Medicine at Methodist Hospital also contributed as a consultant on interface content. The project is currently in its fourth phase of funding from ISC, with other grant proposals in the pipeline. All support from ISC was matched with funds from the Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing, IUPUI.  Dr. Faiola’s paper on MIVA, written with his team of graduate students, was recently accepted to the prestigious Association for Computing Machinery Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI) in the Works-in-Progress category; which will be presented in April in Toronto, Canada.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Luddy IUPUI receives $2.6M IDOE Explore, Engage, and Experience (3E) award  March 3, 2023  The Indiana Department of Education grant “Establish Meaningful PK-12 Pathways and Opportunities for All” includes expansion of the innovative Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce (iDEW) computing curriculum and co-curricular activities already implemented in partnership with area high schools, along with additional teacher training and expanding into area middle schools and elementary schools. The 3E award is aimed at helping local schools and communities strengthen, expand and create effective pre-K to career pathways.  The Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering at IUPUI along with TechServ and TechPoint Foundation for Youth (TPF4Y) will continue the work of the iDEW program and expand STEM programming for additional students in Indianapolis.  Mathew J. Palakal, Sr. Exec. Assoc Dean of Luddy IUPUI, the PI of this award and director of iDEW, said, “Employment in informatics and IT is projected to grow 12 percent through 2024, the fastest among all occupations and is expected to add 488,500 new jobs, from about 3.9 million jobs to about 4.4 million jobs by 2024. However, employers have identified a gap between this demand and the supply of young people prepared to enter the IT/STEM workforce, and Indiana is no exception. We and our partners have proven that with funding like this IDOE grant, we can successfully address the gap and will continue to do so.”  Palakal founded and has expanded the iDEW program to eight area high schools since 2015. To date, over 500 STEM teachers in Indiana have been trained on the iDEW curriculum. iDEW has served over 2500 central Indiana high school students to date, many of whom have pursued a college degree, primarily in STEM programs, and/or entered the IT workforce.  This is the third award Palakal and Luddy IUPUI has received from the IDOE. In 2019, he received the Teacher Professional Development in Computer Science award to train Indiana teachers on essential computer science curriculum.  The 3E (Explore, Engage, and Experience) grant period is through September 2024. 3E is a part of the third round of federal ESSER (Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief) funding.  Read more in the IBJ   ### About iDEW  Designed and managed by the Indiana University Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering in Indianapolis, the Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce (iDEW) program prepares underrepresented minority and economically disadvantaged high school students in Indiana for informatics and computing careers. Students can participate in iDEW for multiple years during high school, diving into new projects and learning modules as they advance through the program. Many will earn professional IT certifications that prepare them for the workforce or for going on to two-year or four-year academic paths in informatics. Working in teams, iDEW students present informatics projects that tackle real-world problems incorporating mobile apps, robotics, video games, internet of things, chatbots, data visualization and other trends in IT.  The iDEW program continues with the addition of the Google Data Analytics Certificate program offering Indiana University dual credit through the IUPUI SPAN program for eligible iDEW high school students. Luddy IUPUI is currently working with 19 students from Arsenal Technical, McKenzie Center for Innovation and Technology and Pike High Schools in the pilot year.  The iDEW program received the national US2020 STEM Mentoring Award in 2017; a $4M National Science Foundation S-STEM Grant; the Indiana Award for Excellence in Career and Technical Training and the TechPoint Mira Award for Tech Educator of the Year in 2018; and the 2022 Bridge Builder Award from the TechPoint Foundation for Youth.   ### About Our Partners  The project also brings a number of entities together with Luddy IUPUI, including the TechPoint Foundation for Youth, Speaking College, Agile Meridian (beLithe), and TechServ. New partners include The ROCK Community Center, Eastern Star Church, and Techucate.  Speaking College, Agile Meridian and Techucate will provide programming for middle school students at the ROCK as part of STEM@ The ROCK. TPF4Y will expand its VEX robotics outreach to reach both elementary and middle schools that are potential ‘feeders’ to the iDEW high school classrooms.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## IUPUI has huge economic impact on central Indiana  June 12, 2009  Recently, the Indiana Business Research Center (IBRC), part of Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business, undertook a study of the economic impact of IU’s campuses statewide, including IUPUI.  City leaders called for the establishment of IUPUI in 1969 because they wanted to improve Indiana’s economic competitiveness with access to higher education. IUPUI answered the call by providing a comprehensive range of academic programs at the state’s population center that made it affordable and convenient for central Indiana residents to improve their earning power and enhance their quality of life.  The IBRC study considered both \"core\" and \"collateral\" benefits, to determine the value added, the impact that would not exist \"but for\" our being here.  The short answer? The direct and ripple effects of IUPUI’s presence in the capital city accounts for $2.5 billion of central Indiana’s economic activity.  How did the IBRC calculate $2.5 billion of impact?  First, it examined the \"core\" benefits that derive from our central mission of education and research, such as where alumni settle to work after graduation or the extent to which IUPUI’s academic programs support the state’s economic development priorities. Second, it examined the \"collateral\" benefits by calculating the impact of university spending and the value of civic engagement in the community.  The IBRC study showed 90 percent of our students are Indiana residents. For undergraduates, the rate is even higher: 96 percent. Of the 19,700 people who received degrees at IUPUI between 1998 and 2002, 72 percent of our alumni were residing in Indiana as of 2008, their education allowing even more significant contributions to their communities.  Most of these were in Marion and Hamilton County.  Between 2002 and 2007, 21,800 degrees (bachelor’s, master’s, professional, doctoral) were earned at IUPUI. More than a fourth (27 percent) were in fields related to the life sciences, a top economic development priority for Indiana.  IUPUI also leads the state in professional degrees (such as law, dentistry, and medicine) conferred by Indiana’s universities.  Because so many alumni remain in Indiana, their lifetime wage-earning potential remains in state with them. The IBRC study also calculated that impact.  The typical male IUPUI graduate can expect to earn $2.1 million in lifetime earnings—64 percent more than an associate degree recipient. This increases to $2.5 million with a master’s degree and $2.9 million with a professional degree.  The typical female can expect $1.5 million over her lifetime—50 percent more than with an associate degree. With an advanced degree, her earning potential goes up to $1.8 million with a master’s and $2.4 million with a professional degree.  The IBRC quantified IUPUI’s impact through university research by determining that, in addition to IUPUI’s employment of 7,051 faculty and staff, university research expenditures account for an additional 13,210 jobs in the region.  IUPUI averages $166 million in annual research expenditures supported by contracts and grants from external sources. These funds, three-fourths of which are from the federal government, are spent mainly in Indiana on goods, services, and the employment of well-educated people who contribute to the state’s economy.  Between 2004 and 2007, IUPUI research generated 483 new invention disclosures, 178 new patent applications, and 64 new patents. Since 2000, technologies developed at IUPUI have generated 11 startup companies, 9 related to life sciences, employing 160 in the Indianapolis area.  More than 100 of these jobs are with ANGEL Learning, course management software developed by Professor of Computer and Information Technology Ali Jafari and David Mills, one of Ali’s students, a 1999 School of Engineering and Technology graduate. Blackboard Inc. just purchased ANGEL Learning for $95 million (editor’s note: Jafari is an adjunct faculty member with the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI.)  The IBRC also measured the impact of civic contributions, such as the value of service learning programs, voluntarism, and charitable contributions. The economic benefit of voluntarism by members of the IUPUI community is $3.4 million annually. Furthermore, IUPUI students, staff, and faculty contributed $4.3 million to Indianapolis-area charitable organizations in 2006-07 alone.

    "body": "  ## Informatics Ph.D. candidate and Regenstrief assess value of public health information exchange  May 21, 2010  As the United States moves toward the goal of a secure nationwide health information network (NHIN), a new study from the Regenstrief Institute and Brian Dixon, a Ph.D. candidate in health informatics from the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, provides a framework for evaluating the costs, effort and value of what is sometimes referred to as the health internet.  The study, which appears in the May/June 2010 issue of Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, also reports on the initial assessment of that framework by health information exchange experts across the nation.  “This work is important, because the framework will help those engaged in health information exchange around the country measure the value of NHIN services to patients and health-care providers as well as to the national health-care reform goals of quality, safety, cost and efficiency,” said Dixon, M.P.A., the study’s first author and a Regenstrief program manager.  The Regenstrief framework also will help the nation track the development and utilization of health information exchange and the array of NHIN services currently under development with support from the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  “Historically novel health care information technologies have been underutilized, restricting their impact on quality of care and patient safety. This new framework will help policymakers understand its value not only in terms of quality and safety but also how widespread data exchange is being used in clinical practice. This will help answer the question of whether the national health information network envisioned by the federal government is a bridge to nowhere or a public utility that is making a difference in improving health care,” said Dixon.  Regenstrief created and operates the Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC), one of the highest volume health information exchanges in the United States. The INPC daily handles approximately 2.5 million secure transactions of clinically relevant data such as laboratory test results, medication and treatment histories, and other clinically important information in a standardized, electronic format. This information is critical to diagnoses, treatment and referral decisions. The INPC membership includes hospitals, physician practices, clinical laboratories, radiology centers, as well as rehabilitation and long term care facilities throughout Indiana.  “The new Regenstrief framework will help health information exchange developers and researchers improve efforts to measure the value that these services provide their members and communities. Locally, we will use the framework to measure how the INPC and the NHIN provide value to Hoosiers in terms of quality, safety, cost and efficiency. We hope the framework can serve as a catalyst for other communities as well to perform similar evaluations of health information exchange,” said J. Marc Overhage, M.D., Ph.D., director of medical informatics at the Regenstrief Institute, Regenstrief Professor of Medicine at the Indiana University School of Medicine, and president and C.E.O. of the Indiana Health Information Exchange  The Regenstrief Institute has been an international leader in the development, implementation and evaluation of health information technology and health information standards for over three decades. Regenstrief investigators are leaders in the development of clinical data standards and health care system interoperability. The institute is located in Indianapolis, the most health-wired metropolitan area in the country.  The study, also co-authored by Atif Zafar, M.D. of the IU School of Medicine and the Regenstrief Institute, was funded by the Regenstrief Institute.     ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Faculty work featured in new digital humanities research methods book  January 28, 2019  Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI faculty Andrea Copeland, Albert William, Zebulun M. Wood, and Ayoung Yoon recently detailed their local heritage, community-based project, Virtual Bethel, in a new book titled Research Methods for the Digital Humanities.  The four researchers authored the chapter, Virtual Bethel: Preservation of Indianapolis’s Oldest Black Church, in the book edited by lewis levenberg, Tai Neilson, and David Rheams and published by Palgrave Macmillan in 2018. In it, they introduced the principles behind 3D imaging, modeling, and representation of spaces and objects, and how they can be used in research, teaching, and learning.  Copeland, William, Wood, and Yoon also shared several important lessons learned that they hope will inform others considering virtual recreation projects. The authors explain that community-based heritage projects require a large investment of time building relationships and trust. These projects aren’t accomplished alone, but require a large, diverse team of highly skilled people. And, partnerships are essential to meet the necessary range of skills and financial cost. Most importantly, they wrote, “respect for the intangible cultural heritage of the people involved needs to be reflected in the virtual recreation. Above all else, we want our community partners to feel respected by the rendering of their cultural heritage when they and others experience Virtual Bethel.”   ### About Bethel AME  Bethel is the oldest African American church in the city of Indianapolis, and was once a vital part of a thriving African American community in the heart of the Indiana Avenue Jazz District. The Church was founded in Indianapolis in 1836, and its archive documents a shared heritage and a living community. Over its 180 years of existence, the Bethel AME Church has played a critical role in the Underground Railroad, the founding of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Indiana, the founding of the first formal School for Black Children in Indianapolis, and the development of the African Methodist Episcopal Church in the United States.  Social and economic influences downtown led to the dwindling of the congregation, the building fell into disrepair, and in 2016 the decision was made to sell it and build a new church in another location.   ### Competencies and Collaborations  A media arts and science team-based course in 3D production/visualization served as the production lab for this project. Students developed skills in pre-production—story concept and development, script writing, research, conceptual drawing, storyboarding, animatics, and project management—as well as production—3D asset creation, time management, sound and title sequences—and post-production–rendering issues, movie creation, and formatting for playback.  Students and faculty worked with the archival documents and physical objects/spaces to learn methods to represent history through new media technology. They also worked with heritage professionals, historians and community experts. William and Wood, media arts and science faculty, collaborated with Copeland and Yoon, library and information science faculty, as well as faculty from history, anthropology, and geology departments in the IU School of Liberal Arts.  Local heritage institutions played an important role in this preservation effort and continue to do so. Copeland and Yoon are leading the local cultural heritage project involving the Bethel AME church. Copeland spent three years working closely with the church archivist and historian, Olivia McGee, to preserve and make accessible the artifacts dating back to 1850. The church’s archive now resides at the Indianapolis Historical Society and, through a partnership with the IUPUI University Library, it has been digitized.    The Virtual Bethel project provided an opportunity for students to use digital arts technology to preserve and represent physical objects and spaces as well as engage audiences in the exploration of history through new media. It also gave the team invaluable insight into cultural heritage challenges and raised awareness of what is being lost from the collective human experience. “The virtual representation of the church’s sanctuary now provides a vessel to engage audiences in the history of Bethel church as well as the history of African Americans in Indianapolis….We believe this project is worthy of our efforts because of its historical significance, but also because of the injustice to the community brought about by gentrification,” they concluded.     ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## LIS faculty William Helling’s U.S. Embassy grant funds IUPUI DEI work in Finland  July 19, 2023  In May 2023, six members of the Luddy Indianapolis DEI Working Group—faculty and students—traveled to Helsinki, Finland. Library and Information Science lecturer William Helling received a grant of $15,000 from the U.S. Embassy in Finland through the Small Grants Program to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts of IUPUI and Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences in Helsinki, Finland. This international collaboration between IUPUI and Haaga-Helia is the start of a longer-term engagement in DEI activities. The connections made during this collaborative process will form the basis of a sustainable partnership that can include other institutions of higher learning in Finland. This experience will help others interested in establishing DEI working groups or simply collaborating on DEI topics and activities.  [William Helling](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/william-helling/)  Helling said, “I saw a need, I had the connections, and I recognized an opportunity. The IUPUI Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering is an innovator in its fields of interest. The Department of Library and Information Science has already been collaborating with Haaga-Helia for several years and more recently has launched the university’s first study-abroad program in Finland, taking place in spring 2022. I have been a Fulbright Scholar at Haaga-Helia in 2013 (Aug-Dec), 2020 (Jan-Mar), and 2022 (Jan-Jun). I have been including, on my own initiative, students from both universities in common courses since 2013; in 2021 I was awarded a Global Classroom Fellowship from Indiana University to formalize the relationship. This interaction aided my successful proposal to establish a study-abroad program to bring IUPUI students to Helsinki each May to complete a spring collaborative course with their Haaga-Helia counterparts. These study-abroad students come from all Luddy programs, not just Library and Information Science. Because of my long-term relationship with Haaga-Helia and the successful networking we had already accomplished, I knew I could take advantage of this situation where we could collaborate even further on a topic of common interest.”  The group co-conducted a two-day workshop on different DEI topics, including building community in online education, designing the safer place culture, DEI in language usage, involving students in designing a gender equity plan, and so on. This workshop involves students, staff, and instructors from the two partner universities as well as other institutions of higher education in Finland. The workshop featured presentations in different formats and allowed much time for attendee participation in discussions. Committee members in attendance were faculty Andrea Copeland , Charles Sutton , and Zeb Wood , and students Amira Malcom, Cordel Blair, and Margaret Breidenbaugh. In addition, the seminar was also a part of IUPUI’s Finland Study Abroad 2023 program, and seven of its students were able to participate.  [Andrea Copeland](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/andrea-copeland/)  [Charles Sutton](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/charles-sutton/)  [Zeb Wood](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/zeb-wood/)  [Finland Study Abroad](https://luddy.iupui.edu/student-life/study-abroad-finland/)  Helling said IUPUI and Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences share many of the same difficulties. “In particular we are both aware of our desire to address issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion for faculty, staff, and students.  The need for such initiatives is felt on the international level. Improving DEI has become the linchpin for recruiting, developing, and retaining faculty and staff,” he said. On the student level, progress in DEI is considered critical for improving student academic success and retention. The collaboration between Luddy and Haaga-Helia focuses on their mutual need for diversity, equity, and inclusion in several areas. The DEI Working Group of IUPUI’s Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering recognizes its need to identify situations where diversity, equity, and inclusion are not being met in order to create a more inclusive and accepting school. Haaga-Helia’s Equity Plan is designed to safeguard the diversity, equality, equity, and non-discrimination of its educational institution as well as to ensure and support the effectiveness of its initiatives for students and staff.   ### What was accomplished during this trip?  The morning of May 16, the IUPUI and Haaga-Helia DEI committee members visited the US Embassy in Helsinki to have a round-table discussion with the embassy’s DEIA advisory board (pictured above). The embassy staff members were curious about their activities and plans and were very supportive and interested in their work.  In the afternoon, a series of small presentations was held on the Haaga-Helia campus where both IUPUI and Haaga-Helia faculty and students introduced topics and engaged attendees in discussions. They continued with presentations and discussions on May 17, culminating in breakout groups for both faculty and students to study the most immediate DEI issues for them along with possible actions to take. Members from both IUPUI and Haaga-Helia were able to identify common areas of concern as well as their methods of addressing these issues. They also recognized some of the unique challenges that the two campuses face. Helling said the networking possibilities were beneficial for both sides.  The archive of the seminar is on the website of the DEI Working Group of the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering at IUPUI.  [DEI Working Group](https://inclusion.luddy.iupui.edu/)   ### What are the next steps?  Luddy DEI members will meet again (virtually) with their Haaga-Helia counterparts after the summer break in order to discuss the important questions as well as conclusions reached in the seminar. IUPUI and Haaga-Helia working group members will evaluate the seminar activity and create additional action plans for their campuses based on the activity. The working group members will also plan on how to sustain their common efforts: they want to share ideas for making progress in DEI. More important, however, is the effort to develop methods for assessing results of DEI activities and collecting evidence of its impact. Finally, they would like to discuss plans for a possible future seminar with Haaga-Helia as a partner, perhaps on the IUPUI campus.  This collaboration is important to the two entities because Luddy’s DEI concerns and goals are shared with Haaga-Helia, and they can mutually benefit by collaboration. “We can learn about the success or missteps of our collaborating partner. Shared strategies will encourage stakeholder institutions and infuse new ideas into the discussion. Students, faculty, and staff from both IUPUI and Haaga-Helia will be the recipients of any advances made in diversity, equity, and inclusion. In brief, this proposed international collaboration between IUPUI and Haaga-Helia is to be considered the start of a longer-term engagement on DEI activities. This experience will help others interested in establishing DEI working groups or simply collaborating on DEI topics and activities,” Helling said.     ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

In S554, you explore the mechanics of the traditional ILS and become familiar with its modules through a series of hands-on exercises in global system configurations, circulation, cataloging, OPAC, serials, and acquisitions. You learn how to categorize your library’s collection and its users in order to create circulation rules that you will use to conduct library business. Much time is spent on populating your virtual library with a variety of records. You also examine library technological standards and related issues involved in implementing, migrating, reporting, and protecting library systems. As a result of current trends in technology and how services are delivered, the traditional ILS is rapidly evolving as well as competing with certain web-based technologies in order to meet patrons’ needs in a more collaborative and interactive manner.   ### Program Learning Goals Supported  Instructors map their courses to specific LIS Program Goals . Mapped program goals drive the design of each course and what students can expect to generally learn.  [LIS Program Goals](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/masters/mlis/program-goals.html)   ### Learning Outcomes  Instructors develop learning outcomes for their courses. Students can expect to be able to achieve the learning outcomes for a given course after successfully completing the course.   ### Course Overview  Instruction is in Canvas. Lessons are organized into Modules whose length may vary.  Module 1: Introduction to the integrated library system This Module introduces the typical Integrated Library System Module ILS: and its products, both proprietary and open source for academic, public, school, or special libraries. Some perspective is given on the historical ILS marketplace and its evolution during the past 40 years.  Module 2: Setting up global system preferences for an ILS To prepare an ILS and make it work as you want for your situation, you have access to system preferences Module e.g., MARC flavor, date format, templates, etc.:. Many default preferences are set, but you are also able to personalize how a particular system works.  Module 3: Configuring item types You begin on how to set up and configure an ILS. This period concentrates on ILS item types for a library. Item types differ per library, and per the type of library Module public, academic, school, special, etc.:. Item types comprise both physical and virtual holdings of a library.  Module 4: Configuring patron types You develop the concept of ILS patron types for a library. You define patron categories and patron attribute types Module identifiers and statistical categories: for patron records, depending on the users of a particular library type.  Module 5: Determining circulation and fines rules You define circulation and fines rules for combinations of libraries, patron categories, and item types. You also examine item circulation alerts: Define rules for check-in and checkout notifications for combinations of libraries, patron categories, and item types.  Module 6: Cataloging In your library ILS development, you examine the cataloging module, how to get MARC records, and how to manipulate these records and their display. You start to build our collection in the library for future circulation practice.  Module 7: Cataloging and cataloging standards; MARC, Z39.50; Authorities You continue to work on the cataloging module, using a Z39.50 client to access MARC records. You also examine the issues of Interlibrary Loan for libraries and how you can use other library resources with your own ILS.  Module 8: Acquisitions You explore a typical ILS by examining the Acquisitions module and how it is related to Cataloging and other components. You will use budgets and funds in the ordering process.  Module 9: Serials: You explore further a typical ILS by examining the Serials module for materials that are received on a predictable pattern. You \"catalog\" serials but in a different manner than non-repeating resources.  Module 10: Circulation You examine the Circulation module of an ILS and how to deal with patron registration issues. You create a patron base and use it to circulate items from our collection.  Module 11: Serving the patron; Patron accounts and enhanced content For our ILS, you explore the features that will allow us to integrate trending technology with our existing system. You cover the impact of social networking in a typical ILS and how to manage it.  Module 12: Relational databases and reports: SQL reports and guided reports The ILS database is demystified. You study the concept of the relational database and how it can be addressed by SQL. You also examine GUI report generating. You construct useful reports with both canned and ad hoc reporting features.  Module 13: Statistics wizards For a typical ILS, you explore the ILS statistics wizard feature to see how our database can provide an overview of library activity. Statistics are essential to any library, but you also discover how statistics can mislead.  Module 14: ILS migration Extracting data once it is in your system is a major consideration. You look at how data was entered into the system and prepare the database so that the extraction is not corrupt. Migrating your data into a new system involves correct mapping. You will resolve this issue for your ILS.   ### Policies and Procedures  Please be aware of the following linked policies and procedures.

    "body": "  ## From Indiana to India: School of Informatics and Computing helping bridge the international life and computer sciences gap  January 26, 2010  A joint effort between the Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI and the National Institute of Technology Calicut (NITC) in India aims to increase international research opportunities among life and computer science scholars. Both institutions have co-founded the first International Symposium on Biocomputing (ISB) to take place February 15th-17th in Calicut, India. Lecturers and presenters representing 14 countries will focus on bioinformatics and biotechnology – two fields of study that bridge the gap between information technology and biology. Organizers hope that resulting collaborations may impact the scientific community’s understanding of biological systems and improve quality of human life.  The symposium is the outcome of an April 2009 visit to NITC by Mathew Palakal, Associate Dean for Graduate Studies and Research at the IU School of Informatics and Computing. Palakal was invited by NITC to give a two-week lecture series on bioinformatics, a discipline prominent in countries like the United States, and its relationship to biotechnology, a leading field of study in India. Recognizing that international divides frequently present barriers to sharing knowledge and research in these areas, Palakal and colleagues at NITC envisioned the symposium as a means to better integrate research thrusts in the areas of bioinformatics and biotechnology.  Both bioinformatics and biotechnology represent the application of information technology to molecular biology, but each is distinctive in its approach. Bioinformatics employs an in silico methodology, using computers and computer simulations to develop hypotheses concerning biological processes. Biotechnology tests and analyzes those hypotheses in vitro, or in controlled environments like a Petri dish. Both disciplines are essential to the translational research process that ultimately allows biologists to conduct in vivo medial testing in animals and humans.  “Bioinformatics and biotechnology are really two sides of the same coin,” said Palakal. “The more we are able to blur boundaries and integrate practices, the more meaningful and effective our research and its impact on quality of human life becomes.” Palakal, the symposium’s Program Chair and an invited speaker, is especially proud of students’ participation in the event as presenters. Highly-ranked papers were selected from more than 120 international student submissions and will include works from bioinformatics graduate students Rini Paul and Satishkumar Ganakammal from the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI.  The International Symposium on Biocomputing is sponsored by the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM), the leading professional body of computer scientists and engineers from across the globe. The Department of Computer and Information Science at the Purdue University School of Science at IUPUI is an additional organizer of this important event. Registration for the symposium is still open. For more details on registration and programming, please visit www.isb2010.org.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## School of Informatics and Computing Summer Workshop Series Wrap Up  August 6, 2013  The School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI and area high school students took the summer season as an opportunity to hold and attend a series of technologically enriching workshops.      The summer workshops were taught by faculty in the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, and covered a bevy of topics in the media arts field, focusing on everything ranging from game design to 3D animation, video production, Photoshop, and app development for smartphones.  Students were able to work and become familiar with the latest technology, production equipment, and software during class sessions.  The finale to the summer series was a new class, taught by lecturer Travis Faas, which gave students the opportunity to develop apps for iPhone and Android phones.  In the class, students learned what goes into creating an app, how to create their own app, and how to submit their finished product to one of the many current app stores.  Each of the workshops was a week long, Monday through Friday, with class sessions going from 8: 30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. daily.  Classes were open to any student entering, currently enrolled in, or graduating from grades 9-12.  No prior experience was necessary to attend any of the workshops.  The workshop series began mid-June and ran through the end of July. All of the workshops were heavily attended.  Enrollment for the last workshop, app development, was filled to capacity.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## MAS video student Jayce Lovett film pays tribute to veterans and mental health  March 15, 2023  Ever since Jayce Lovett was young he was fascinated by video production and how the content we watch everyday is made. He says it has also been a life goal of his to bring happiness to the people around him. And he saw video production as a way to do that.  Lovett chose Luddy IUPUI (formerly SoIC) because they seemed to be a well rounded school that ticked all the right boxes. “IUPUI as a whole had such an alluring nature to it with everything they do and the opportunities they give you,” he says.  His senior Capstone project was one such opportunity.  “The reason I made my documentary about veterans and their mental health struggles stems back to when I was in high school. When I was a junior in high school I joined Interactive Media (aka IMTV). This was a career technical program my school offered students as a way to learn different forms of media production, and to give us real world experience with real clients.  “Through IMTV I met Mike Maloney, who was the founder of the Veterans Memorial Park and Digital Library, an online archive of veterans’ stories. I was brought on to do all of the video production for the organization, and through that I met a lot of interesting people, and I learned about the struggles that come along with the line of duty. It was from hearing all these stories from our service men and women that made me realize there’s a big issue in their community—mental illness,” Lovett says.  Mental illness as a whole has been made to feel stigmatized, and it’s felt even more so in the veteran community. Lovett says the goal with his documentary was to destigmatize mental illness and show people that they are not alone and that they can seek help, and that their siblings in arms want them to seek help, and that they won’t be judged for seeking that help.  “Interviewing veterans for this documentary was a mixed bag of emotions to be 100 percent honest. While talking to these men and women we talked about the best of times in the military and the worst of times in the military,” Lovett says. “Speaking with them made me learn that some of them have seen the worst of the worst the world has to offer, which only solidifies the fact that they need our help and support. But overall, I enjoyed every interview I did. Each person had such a vibrant and wonderful personality, and the fact they were trusting me to tell their stories makes me feel honored.”  “…find what you’re passionate about, the things that get you out of bed.”  After graduation Lovett plans on continuing his work in video production and continue his passion for documentary making. He is currently working on part two of his “I am a Veteran” documentary that he presented at Capstone.  [“I am a Veteran” documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=oU_LCq6wPig&feature=youtu.be)  His advice to other students is to find what you’re passionate about, the things that get you out of bed. “Within MAS we have a very niche set of skills that can be used to change our lives or the world, but the first step to any change is going to be a passion,” he says.  “Part of me is sad that my time in MAS and IUPUI has come to an end, but I’ve learned so many important lessons and met many influential people in my life while I was here that I can’t imagine my life being any different. I’m ready to go on with what I’ve learned and make my mark on the world.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "url": "URL: https://luddy.iupui.edu/careers/services/career-prep/resume.html#search",
    "body": "  ## Resume  A well-prepared resume and cover letter are essential to getting a job interview, as is a concise presentation of your abilities, accomplishments, and future capabilities. For a job search, your resume and cover letter must conform to basic, generally accepted standards, including only information that is relevant to an employer’s needs. In comparison, an academic or international resume is often a curriculum vitae (CV), a much longer and more detailed synopsis of your educational and professional history.   ### Resume Format and Appearance  Your resume should be organized chronologically with the most recent job experience information first. This format emphasizes job titles and organizations and describes in detail the accomplishments and responsibilities associated with each position.  There is no one correct resume layout to use, and you should avoid using templates. The best resume is one that clearly and effectively communicates your experience, skills, achievements, and future potential. Generally, your resume should be attractive and easy to read: use consistent font, spacing, and formatting with a balance of white space. A resume without white space can appear cluttered and chaotic, but a resume with too much white space gives the impression that you have run out of things to add or say. A balance of white space is reader friendly, as it allows the reader to maintain focus or take notes on the resume, if needed.  Resumes should be free of spelling, grammatical, and typographical errors. Be sure to have several people review your resume for errors and omissions.   #### Resume Length  A resume should be a single page. Employers generally expect one page per 10 years of related experience or degree earned.  Graduate students or individuals with extensive full-time work experience may have two pages, but the second page must be full (i.e., no half or partial pages).   #### Common Sections   #### Must Include  Several sections of information should be included on your resume:   #### Optional  Optional sections or subsections include:   #### Do Not Include  Aside from contact information, personal and private information is usually excluded from resumes due to job discrimination policies designed to protect you. Therefore, information that should NOT be added to a resume includes:   ### Resume Sections  Follow this step-by-step guide to create a draft of your resume.   #### Contact Information  The heading can be set up in a variety of ways, but your name should be the largest text on your resume. Your contact information must be readable and consistent across all job-search documents (resume, cover letter, and reference list).  The heading should include your:  Optional information includes your portfolio website, your LinkedIn page, or your GitHub link. This information should be included ONLY if the site or profile is current, and it reflects your professional ambitions. Personal websites with non-professional content (e.g., Facebook) should not be referenced and should have restricted privacy settings.   #### Education  Educational experiences should be listed near the top of your resume, and you should always list your most recent education first. High school information should not be included.  Education information should include:   #### Experience  In this section, include full-time work, summer jobs, internships, co-ops, campus/student jobs, research, and volunteer opportunities that are relevant to the position you are seeking or that highlight transferable skills. Experience information should include:  Do not include reasons for leaving, salary history, exaggerations of responsibilities, names or phone numbers of supervisors, or jobs you plan to hold in the future.  The responsibilities and qualifications should allow readers of your resume to get an idea of what your work entailed and what you accomplished in that position. This information should be presented in bullet points, each beginning with a strong action verb written in the appropriate tense. Quantify and/or qualify when you can. They should also be written in third person (e.g., no personal pronouns such as me, my, our, etc.).   #### Achievement Statements: Resume Bullet Points  Achievement (or accomplishment) statements should be used to describe your experiences within your resume. Rather than just describing the tasks you completed, these statements allow you to highlight your particular skills, qualities and characteristics you have and would likely bring to your next organization.   #### Brainstorming Achievements  To start thinking about achievements rather than job duties, ask yourself some of the following questions:  Once you have determined achievements to highlight, use the formula below to transform them into full statements.  Bullet points should be formatted as such: Action Verb + Skill/Duty + Accomplishment   #### Additional Considerations   #### Choosing Action Verbs  Use action words to begin bullet points that describe your experience and accomplishments.  [action words](https://www.colorado.edu/career/job-searching/resumes-and-cover-letters/resumes/action-verbs-use-your-resume)   #### Technical Skills  Employers recruiting from the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering want to quickly see the technical skills in which you are proficient. Therefore, you should separate these skills into categories (e.g., languages, platforms, databases, etc.), list specific examples such as Python or Java, and include level of proficiency.  These skills can also include fluency in foreign languages, lab skills, or other areas of competence that are related to the job.  Example:  TECHNICAL SKILLS Languages: Java, Scheme, C/C++, Python, Visual Basic Platforms: UNIX, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS, Linux Databases: SQL, Microsoft Access, Oracle, FoxPro Web development: JavaScript, Cold Fusion, HTML, XML Miscellaneous: Microsoft Excel, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe InDesign   #### Additional Sections   #### Related Coursework or Projects  A related coursework or projects section is appropriate if the projects and research you have completed are indications of your knowledge and preparation for the job you are seeking. Related coursework can be included under the education section and should be limited to the titles of six to eight higher-level courses. For example, informatics undergrads can list and describe their capstone project in a few short phrases. Classes are often listed for those who have not had much work experience, and it should be considered optional and/or unnecessary if you have significant experience in your field.   #### Student Involvement, Leadership, or Volunteer Activities/Clubs/Organizations  Employers like to see that you are a well-rounded student with activities and interests outside of your academic coursework. These activities include professional, educational, or organizational involvement, as well as accompanying leadership positions. They are an indication of your leadership, team-oriented, and organizational skills.   ### Resume Do’s and Don’ts   ### Do   ### Don't "

The award focuses on the efforts of promoting diversity and inclusion in an Indiana library.  [Indiana Library Federation](https://www.ilfonline.org)  [Southport High School](http://www.perryschools.org/sh/)  “I’m proud to accept the award on behalf of the Southport High School IMC because it is our mission to provide a safe haven for students and staff from our diverse community to pursue their independent learning goals as they discover their role in their ever-changing world,” Foor said. “I think it’s important to note that school libraries are spaces that can also be welcoming to individuals from all walks of life and I am grateful that our state association recognized our IMC as a space that is open to all in the Southport High School community.”  One of the programs at Southport High School IMC that Foor is most passionate about is the Cultures of Southport festival program that focuses on the stories of their refugee students on Giant Maps from National Geographic. The collaboration between the library and different departments involves activities during school hours but is also open to the community to attend. English, English Learners and Social Studies departments helped students document their stories that could be told through a Giant Map tour. Art classes created art projects based on different featured cultures and math students calculated distances traveled by their peers. Exodus Refugee Immigration and other community members set up booths with information and games and activities. This event has even traveled to the Indiana State Museum.  Foor, who says she had wanted to teach for as long as she could remember, originally found herself in the classroom after earning a degree in English Education. Once there, she felt there was so much more she could connect her curriculum to, beyond her content area. “I felt like becoming a school librarian would be better suited to my desires to teach cross-curricularly, as well as emphasize my belief that reading is a great way to pursue our learning goals,” Foor said. She took the advice of other library science alumni and enrolled at the School of Informatics and Computing to pursue a career in school librarianship.  “The MLS program prepares you for all facets of librarianship.”  The Master of Library Science (MLS) coursework is the foundation for becoming a successful school librarian, Foor said. Her grant writing class led her to receive multiple grants for collection development and programming and the Materials for Youth course reinforced her knowledge of locating and promoting materials among readers of different ages. Foor also did an independent research project in Iceland, which allowed her to research different strategies in the field of international school librarianship.  [Master of Library Science](https://luddy.iupui.edu/lis/master-library-science/)  Andrea Copeland, chair of the Department of Library and Information Science at the School of Informatics and Computing, said of Foor, “I am not surprised that Tara has inspired this level of creativity in her community. As a student she certainly marched to her own drum—always surprising me with her interpretation of assignments. That kind of thinking changes the world.”  Foor’s advice to those considering the MLS program is to talk to alumni and see if they will let you job shadow for a day. “I recommend doing this so you understand the scope of the profession beyond the stereotype of librarians sitting and reading all day,” she said. Every day serves up its own challenges and there is never a dull moment, she added. “Be prepared for chaos, creativity, spontaneity, stress, laughter, and even tears, because you are entering a profession that will be serving people from all walks of life. Utilize your skills and training to make the world a better place.”             ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## IU Informatics adjunct professor nominated for National Emmy Award  April 15, 2009  Brice Bowman knows what excellence sounds like.  After all, he’s been in the audio recording business since 1981, racking up four National Emmy Award nominations, and twice bagging the television industry’s top prize for sound design and mixing.  Now, the co-owner of Earshot Audio-Post has rung up a fifth National Emmy nomination, and Bowman likes the sound of it.  “TV networks select their finest production work and enter it in various categories for the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Emmy Awards,” explained Bowman.  “In this case, ABC submitted the video tease to last year’s Indianapolis 500 telecast, for which I produced the sound design.  Entries are judged by a jury of industry peers and I’m deeply honored by this nomination.”  Entitled The Perfect Storm, the two-and-a-half minute opening video sequence for the Indy 500 is a smorgasbord of audio delights – from the snap and crackle of the computer-generated lightning, to the clink of the animated winner’s bottle of milk on the Speedway’s famous yard of bricks.  [click link at top of page to watch the video]  \"Accepting my first Emmy Award in New York a couple of years ago was an incredible experience, and this fifth nomination represents a track record of work with ABC/ESPN of which I am very proud,\" said Bowman.  Bowman, 51, is an adjunct professor teaching advanced sound design at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, and serves on the school’s Media Arts and Science Advisory Board.  He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree with a double major in telecommunications and philosophy from Indiana University, Bloomington.  \"The quality of student and professional talent in media production in Indianapolis is world-class in film, video, audio, and new media,” explained Bowman.  “As an industry, we need to do a better job of telling the world what is available here.\"  Bowman and Earshot are well known and highly respected on the local media scene.  Long-time advertising guru Ron Pearson offers this endorsement of Bowman’s work:  “Meshing music and effects and voice together for TV soundtracks: awesome. Eliciting savvied sound effects to ratchet up a VO: stellar.”  In 2002, Bowman and a business partner launched Earshot Audio-Post, a full-service commercial audio production facility specializing in sound design, original music scoring, and audio post-production for video, television, film and new media. The multi-studio complex was designed by Bowman and is located in Broad Ripple Village, Indianapolis.  \"Although we are based in Indianapolis, much of Earshot’s work is done for firms across the U.S.,” Bowman emphasized.  “National Emmy Awards and nominations let current and prospective clients know that Earshot Audio-Post is capable of sound design projects at the highest level.\"  The National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences will announce the winners at the 30th Annual Sports Emmy Awards, April 27th, Lincoln Center, New York City.

    "body": "  ## School of Informatics and Computing Alum Works on PBS Nationally Syndicated Program  January 24, 2014  Kylee Wall, a 2009 Media Arts and Science graduate from the School of Informatics and Computing (SOIC), recently completed work on the third season of the nationally syndicated PBS television program, “This American Land”.    “This American Land” is a television series whose primary focus is on the theme of conservation. The series which recently wrapped-up its third season airs nationwide on PBS stations. The show delivers engaging stories on America’s landscapes, waters and wildlife – and takes viewers to the front lines of conservation, science and outdoor adventure.  Wall, who is currently employed by the Atlanta-based media production firm, Biscardi Creative Media, served as lead editor on the program. Her responsibilities included offline and online editing, crafting individual stories and finishing other stories from outside editors. She was also in charge of the final assembly and delivery of each episode.  According to Kylee, she “loved getting a lot of footage and a rough outline of the intended message and then being given free rein to do my own thing, and craft a story out of what I was given. In fact, doing just that for one of the stories landed me my first producer credit!”  Before working on “This American Land”, Kylee’s previous experience was focused on corporate and web-based work, with independent short and feature films on the side. Kylee, along with other SOIC alumni, was actively involved in 48 Hour Film Projects locally after graduation, winning a number of awards for short films.  When asked what advice she would give anyone aspiring to get a job in the film and television industry, she said “ask a lot of questions and meet as many people as you can. I got hired at this job because of my positive social media presence. You never know where your next opportunity will be.”  To view Kylee’s work on “This American Land”, check your local public television stations’ schedule for airdates.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Projects and Papers from iAI Funding  Seed funded projects and papers generated from seed funding from the IUPUI Institute of Integrative Artificial Intelligence (iAI).   ## Seed Funded Projects   ### A Novel AI-based Approach to Facilitate Code-Switching for AAVE Speaking Students  African American Vernacular English (AAVE) is an English dialect spoken by the vast majority of members of the African American community. Decades of American stigma have made it an academic obstacle for African students in US public education [1–4]. Students who speak a different English dialect from SAE must learn to work between their own dialect and SAE, the dialect taught in formal speaking and writing in the US. This skill is called code-switching and differs from translating only in that it is specific to dialects from a shared parent language. There are similarities between the challenges of learning a different language and learning a different dialect. It has been shown that at a national level over the past decade, an achievement gap exists between African American students and other students in reading comprehension at different grade levels[5]. Historically, AAVE has also been directly linked to this achievement gap and is still viewed negatively in academic settings. Baugh notes how AAVE can create barriers for African American students to succeed, especially in Reading and Language Arts, and attributes much of this gap to the negative attitudes towards AAVE and its users [6]. Within US public school system grades K-12, this view has contributed to this gap[4]. Therefore, to reduce this academic performance gap, there is a critical need to develop methods to minimize this communication barrier. In the absence of such methods, the academic and professional advancement of the African American community will continue to be hindered . Artificial intelligence and machine learning methods, similar to Neural machine translation (NMT), will be useful tools, as such methods have been successfully used to facilitate learning English in other contexts [7].  The long-term goals of this research are to reduce the academic performance gap in reading comprehension that exists between African American students and their non-African American counterparts. To achieve this goal, our specific objective is to build an automatic dialect-to-dialect translation model between AAVE and SAE , specifically designed for educational use. The central hypothesis is that implementing an inter-dialect translation model developed from an AAVE/SAE corpus will improve academic performance in reading comprehension for African American students in US public education . This research effort also aims to increase the participation of African American students in AI education and research, which will further reduce this performance gap . Diversifying research participation in AI will translate to diverse AI tools and mitigate unwanted bias in applied AI. This research will have two specific aims:  The proposed research effort is creative and original because it develops an AAVE/SAE parallel corpus and a translation model that can be used for additional research that relates directly to the underrepresented African American community. This research addresses the lack of applied AI for the educational benefit of African American students in public education and can potentially change the social views of AAVE as a dialect of English. Accurate AAVE translation can develop tools used to create entire bodies of text in AAVE, which can be used to foster the development of code-switching skills of AAVE speakers. Specifically, a novel educational tool will be built to aid the development of code-switching skills in AAVE-speaking students. This translator will detect and suggest changes in written text in real-time. In addition to being used as a standalone tool, the translator can also be used as an add-on feature to an existing tool, like Grammarly. Our long-term plan includes collaborating with local K-12 schools with high African-American student enrollment to deploy this tool, iteratively improve based on feedback, and measure the impact.   ### Around the Development of a Community Typology in which School-Based Incidents of Antisemitism Occur  Much like other forms of bias, oppression, and hate, the incidence of antisemitism has been on the rise in the United States since 2015. Data collected by the Antidefamation League (ADL) indicate that schools, in particular, have been sites of antisemitic incidents. In the current sociocultural environment of permissiveness towards hatred, hundreds of incidents ranged from high school students using Nazi symbols, imagery, and antisemitic language (Pink, 2019a) to swastikas chalked onto the playgrounds of elementary schools. This collaboration between members of the IU School of Education-Indianapolis and the IU School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI draws on the ADL’s database of reported antisemitic incidents in schools across the nation, layering these reported incidents with a variety of demographic, historical, geographic and media-related data to develop a set of “community types.” From a curricular, training, and intervention-based perspective, a school-based incident of antisemitism would need to be addressed differently in Driggs, ID, than Brooklyn, NY. The community types will provide a guide for curating different packages to offer to different kinds of communities based on the factors explored in this research project. We will later partner with the non-profit organization Facing History and Ourselves to create targeted interventions—both pro-actively and responsively—for these schools and communities based on the community type in the form of curriculum, training, and workshops.  [Facing History and Ourselves](https://www.facinghistory.org/)   ### 4D-ICH: A New and Non-invasive Modality to Characterize Hemodynamic Parameters and Flow patterns for Severe Asymptotic Carotid Stenoses  Stroke is a leading cause of morbidity, mortality, and disability in the U.S., accounting for around 795,000 new or recurrent strokes, 190,000 deaths, and $53 billion in medical costs each year [1]. Carotid arterial stenosis, a condition that involves blockage of blood flow from the heart to the head due to arterial lumen reduction, is the major cause of large-vessel ischemic strokes. Severe asymptomatic carotid stenosis (ACS) (lumen reduction above 85%) has been continuously challenging physicians to decide when and how to treat it because of the bifold stroke risks: an ACS will place a patient at more than a 3% increased risk of having a stroke in the next year whereas the risk of a patient having a stroke during endovascular therapy is 4.4% [2]. Uncertainties remain regarding the optimal technique for long-term prevention of stroke events in asymptomatic patients and, indeed, whether revascularization is sufficiently better than the best medical therapy [3]. Physicians would better address such stroke risks if they could access the lesional blood flow behavior and characteristics in carotid arteries. The literature has shown that hemodynamic flow parameters (HFPs) and local geometrical and flow patterns (LGFPs) are highly tied to stroke risks. HFPs include wall shear stress (WSS) [4-8], tensile stress9, trans-stenotic pressure gradient (TSPG) [10], and pulsatility index [11]; LGFPs include carotid web7, eccentric plaques5, recirculation [4,7,8], and vortex shedding [12]. Listed in Table 1, they can be obtained from the 4-dimensional blood flow that varies in 1-D time and 3-D space. However, they are not available concurrently in current clinical measurement.  The newly emerged engineering technique, called image-based computational hemodynamics (ICH) [13-15], is a promising non-invasive approach to address this medical need. Many studies [16-24] have demonstrated that ICH could reliably quantify the 4-D velocity and pressure fields in the diseased arterial system based on radiological imaging information such as Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) and Doppler ultrasonography (DUS), from which one can, but is not limited, obtain the FHPs and visualize the LGFPs concurrently. Therefore, there is a critical need for clinicians to utilize the ICH capability to advance stroke prediction using FHPs and LGFPs.  ICH has been increasingly used in human cardiovascular systems to assess the severity of various vascular diseases, such as arterial stenosis [16-19] and arterial aneurysms [20-22]. It has become a promising noninvasive approach to quantifying hemodynamics (cardiovascular function) [23,24], resulting in innovation in medical device design, nonsurgical procedure planning, and tissue engineering. Despite the proven potential, ICH is not clinically accessible due to two bottlenecks. First, a typical ICH process from image data input to FHPs and LGFPs output requires proficient skills for image segmentation, flow modeling, high-performance computing, and post-processing of fluid data, as illustrated in Figure 1. Clinicians usually do not have these skills and cannot afford the training curve. Second, the ICH demands computation expense, typically taking days to weeks per case. It will take a much longer time to compute FHPs and visualize LGFPs, as our studies [25,26] indicate. The demanding software skills and high computation cost make ICH impractical in clinical settings. To address such a critical need, we propose to build a software system, 4D-ICH, to remove the bottlenecks and enable clinicians to use HFPs and LGFPs directly for predicting the lesional stroke risk of ACS.   ### AI Augmented Peer Led Team Learning  The number of STEM occupations (6.1% of all US jobs in the year 2019) is projected to grow at 8% between 2019 and 2029, in contrast to a growth rate of 3.4% for non-STEM jobs. Further, the median annual wage of STEM jobs in 2019 was $86,980, in contrast to that of non-STEM jobs ($38,160) (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2020). Yet, at the same time, an estimated 48% of STEM higher education students switch to a non-STEM field or leave studies altogether (Seymour and Hunter, 2019), with women, underprepared students, and students of color being among the students at a high risk of switching and leaving. Further, 35% of the decisions to switch can be attributed to negative effects of STEM classroom experiences. A recent study has also found that only 26% of the observed STEM classrooms used research-based instructional strategies. Active learning, which underlies most research-based instructional strategies, refers to \"a method of learning in which students are actively or experientially involved in the learning process and where there are different levels of active learning, depending on student involvement\". IUPUI, the premier Urban Research University in Indiana, has been at the forefront of active learning research and implementation. One of the successful research, development and entrepreneurship projects in active STEM learning conducted at IUPUI is Peer Led Team Learning (PLTL) and Cyber PLTL.   ### Identifying the unknown: Can AI recognize biological characters in insects?  Insects represent a large majority of the biodiversity on Earth, with approximately 5.5 million insect species, of which only ~20% are described. Traditionally, the identification of a new species requires a skilled taxonomist to visually extract morphological (physical) characters on the new insect that are not present in any other species that may be related. If the species is a new species, then, this species will contain morphological characters that are at odds with the existing keys, and thus a conclusion can be made it is a new species, and new characters are extracted and described so that other scientists can then make meaningful discoveries about the biology of the insect. Ultimately, the most important aspect of describing new species is rooted in the ability to define differentiable characteristics. What may not be differentiable by human recognition, may be differentiable by artificial intelligence (AI). Our long-term vision in this research project is to seek to answer whether AI can ultimately surpass human experts in extracting these subtle, yet potentially differentiable, morphological characteristics.  We believe that the AI model for insect identification should be designed by recognizing beforehand the open-world nature of the species identification problem and should not only identify future samples of species represented during training (seen classes) but should also be capable of detecting and identifying samples of unrepresented species (unseen classes). Identifying samples of unseen classes is an ill-defined problem. Although AI models can be tailored to operate in an open-set classification setting to detect insect samples with no matching classes in the training data, such an approach can only detect an insect sample as outlier but cannot identify its species of origin. As a by-product, the project will produce an AI system that can streamline image-based insect identification not just for common insect classes but also for rare and undescribed ones as well through image analysis and character extraction.   ### Processing and Analyzing Calcium Transient Imaging Data Collected by Miniscopes in Freely-Moving Rats and Mice  Drug addiction, a chronic neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by compulsive drug seeking and taking even after prolonged withdrawal periods, causes a serious burden to individuals and societies around the world. It is estimated that 11.8 million people die each year due to substance abuse, which is more than the number of deaths from all types of cancer. Preventing relapse to drugs after prolonged periods of abstinence is one of the most challenging aspects of treating addiction in the clinic. Therefore, we developed a new concept “addiction-related motor engrams (ARMEs)” to define the potential involvement of CPNs, which originate from the supplementary motor area (M2) and project to, although not exclusively, the habit related-dorsal striatum including both dorsolateral and dorsomedial striatum (DLS, DMS), as key nodes connecting motor programs and drug-seeking behaviors. The mechanisms of relapse will be investigated in two underexplored aspects, i.e., the motor CPNs and the SCN4B subunits (a sodium channel subunit potentially responsible of increased neuronal excitability) in M2 and their striatal synapses. Our hope is to pave the way not only as a novel perspective in understanding addiction behaviors, but also to provide novel targets for clinical management of drug relapse.   ### Connected Autonomous Recharging Articulating Vehicles for Agile Networks (CARAVAN)  This project will produce preliminary results for the newly proposed concept at IUPUI – Connected, autonomous, recharging, and articulating vehicles for agile networks (CARAVAN) for enabling intelligent logistics and transportation. This project will advance fundamental knowledge in interdisciplinary fields that intersect with cooperative multi-agent control, vehicle-to-vehicle communications, reliability assessment, and human-computer interaction. The management and control of connected and autonomous heavy trucks will be studied using reinforcement learning and other AI methods to improve system safety and reliability over a wide spectrum of driving modes, including CARAVAN formation or dissolution, merging and splitting, disturbances from surrounding traffic, and resilience to component failures. Investigating human cognition in road scene understanding will also help the AI agents in CARAVAN interact with other road users efficiently. Driving videos recorded during different interaction scenes will be annotated via crowdsourcing experiments, from which visual cues and relationships with decisions will be retrieved with specifically trained algorithms. The labels will prepare a graph convolutional network for long-term intention and trajectory prediction for other road users.   ### Explainable and non-exhaustive deep learning models for cell classification and mapping from sparse human tissue in kidney health and disease  Kidney disease is a major health burden and a leading cause of mortality and healthcare expenditure. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is highly prevalent, caused predominantly by diabetes and hypertension. A significant hurdle to develop effective treatment against kidney disease is a lack of understanding of cellular and molecular pathways underlying human CKD. The goal of this application is to solidify and extend our preliminary work to be applicable on large datasets and in the setting of disease. Our central hypothesis is that: when tissue is sparse, a machine learning approach to classify cell types based solely on 3D nuclear staining with DAPI staining will provide a comprehensive cell map of the human kidney and characterize the changes in the state of specific cells during kidney disease. To test this hypothesis, we will use the following specific aims:   ### Image guided clinically interpretable feature-based deep learning models for detecting diabetic retinopathy  Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a microvascular complication of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and remains a leading cause of preventable blindness. It is asymptomatic in its early stages, but progression of the disease leads to an irreversible vision loss. However, adequate management of DM and regular comprehensive eye examination can preserve vision in DR in 98% of cases. DR screening and diagnoses currently involves highly trained and qualified human personnel and less automation. This results in a greater cost for both developing and developed countries. The major aims of this project are 1) develop novel deep learning models pretrained with transfer learning approaches for accurately detecting DR status 2) develop imaging feature-based clinically interpretable models, which can explain the contribution of retinal alterations in patients extracted by retinal image segmentation for detecting diabetic retinopathy and 3) validate and iteratively improve the developed models over time.   ### Designing intelligent agents to identify and generate neural dynamics  Decision-making requires an agent to be open to novel information, but also resistant to distraction. Advancements in neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) provide a powerful heuristic to identify how the computational properties of a neural system is optimized to perform behaviors requiring either flexibility or intense focus. Understanding how the brain can move between these states is a critical and unmet need. The overarching goal of this proposal is to determine how computation in the brain is altered such that optimal control states emerge to guide the immediate needs of decision-making. Preliminary data indicate that actuating neural activity in an intelligent agent in the form of a recurrent neural network, yields quantitatively similar results to those seen in animal models of decision-making. This project will extend this work by identifying ways to increase the biological feasibility of intelligent agents.   ### Machine Learning-Assisted Design of Lithium-ion Battery Electrodes  Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are the state-of-the-art energy storage systems and power suppliers for consumer electronics, electric vehicles, and the smart grid. In comparison to alternative rechargeable battery technologies (lead-acid, Ni-Cd, and Ni-MH), LIBs offer higher gravimetric energy density, higher volumetric energy density, higher voltage, higher cycle life, low shelf-discharge rate, faster charging time, and lower toxicity. Thanks to tremendous research and development efforts, the energy density of LIBs continues to grow at a rate of 10% per year. However, the required power for portable electronic devices is predicted to increase at a much faster rate of 20% per year. Similarly, the global electric vehicle battery capacity is expected to increase from around 170 GWh per year today to 1.5 TWh per year in 2030, this is an increase of 125% per year. Currently, there are no methods or design tools to support a faster LIB development. To keep up with the increasing energy demand, a breakthrough in battery design technology is required.  To significantly accelerate the development of LIBs and maximize their energy density, a multidisciplinary research team from Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) proposes the development of a multitask Bayesian machine learning (BML) method. This approach offers the unique ability to process data from physical experiments, material databases, and multi-scale, multi-fidelity computational models, to guide the experiments and simulations that support the discovery and optimization of the electrode microstructures. In order to experimentally verify the effectiveness of the proposed Bayesian machine learning method, the IUPUI team is partnering with Advanced Renewable Power (ARP), LLC (arpteck.com), a company located in Indianapolis that develops and manufactures compact, high-performance power solutions to power the next generation of Hybrid Electric transit buses and delivery trucks. For this verification, ARP and the IUPUI team will apply the proposed multitask BML method to develop an optimal LiNixMn(2-x)O4 electrode, which will be fabricated and tested in a LIB cell.   ### Artificial Intelligence-assisted identification of mitochondrial morphology and neuronal development in response to alcohol using Fkbp5 KO mice  Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is among the most expensive health care problems faced by our society, with upwards of 184.6 billion dollars spent annually on treatment, alcohol-related morbidity, and mortality. Increasing evidence suggests a high level of comorbidity between AUD and psychiatric disorders. One hypothesis that has drawn considerable attention is that alcohol use exacerbates the dysregulation of mitochondrial function, contributing to the comorbidity of AUD and various mental illnesses. Our new findings suggest that Fkbp5 KO is a precisely controlled genetic animal model with a phenotype related to neuron function. However, current manual data counts of mitochondrial and neuronal differences are low throughput and lack the quantification of dynamic alterations. Our long-term goal is to develop a novel treatment for the comorbidity of AUD and mental illness. In this direction, the objectives of our proposed research are to investigate Fkbp5 in the regulation of mitochondrial morphology and networks, and neuronal development. Alcohol is a cellular stressor that exacerbates normal biological processes. The co-chaperone FKBP5 protein appears essential for hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis function as well as cellular response to various insults. Our extensive preliminary data strongly support that Fkbp5 is involved in cell and organelle morphology changes, and could lead to enhanced mitochondrial function via regulation of microtubule-associated proteins. Therefore, our hypothesis is that Fkbp5 regulates mitochondrial morphology via regulation of microtubule-associated proteins.   ### Investigation on Multiresolution Learning for Building Robust Deep Neural Networks and Their Applications  Deep neural networks (DNN) or deep learning provide a major breakthrough technology in AI domain and are widely adopted recently for increasingly complex and large-scale machine learning problems including image classification, speech recognition, language translation, drug discovery, and self-driving vehicles. While DNN achieve remarkable success in terms of performance, recent studies have shown that DNN lack robustness, and hence are highly vulnerable to perturbations in the input space. This iAI white paper proposal is devoted to a systematic study on how to address the serious vulnerability in current DNN models and their impacts on applications. We seek not only the better understanding of the cause of the vulnerability of DNN models, but also attempt to propose an effective and efficient approach to make DNN much more robust for practical applications. Motivated by our previous research on multiresolution learning for the improvement of generalization and robustness of shallow neural networks, we propose to systematically investigate multiresolution learning for DNN models. The basic idea is to exploit the different resolutions of training data in DNN training process, allowing DNN to learn and extract better the underlined patterns and structures of data at different resolution levels. Consequently, the better the DNN models learn, the better their robustness. To the best of our knowledge, no existing work explores multiresolution learning paradigm for DNN yet, except for our preliminary study.   ### Predicting stroke and identifying high risk factors in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis (ACS)  Stroke is a leading cause of death in the western world and a significant cause of disability and loss of quality of life. It is critical to identify the asymptomatic carotid stenosis (ACS) patients at higher risk of stroke and provide corresponding invasive treatment. However, in a busy clinical set-up, it is difficult to do all tests or exams to identify all different features to identify the ACS patients with a higher stroke-risk potential. The objective of this research is to investigate whether artificial intelligence (AI) models can systematically identify the plaque and patient features of the ACS patients with higher stroke risk based on the real-world Electronic Health Records (EHR) data. If high accurate prediction can be achieved, early treatment and intervention can be planned to prevent strokes in the ACS patients at high risk for a stroke while avoiding unnecessary surgery with its risks in other patients. The AI models will permit the inclusion of all previous ultrasound studies, CTA studies, patient demographics, clinical exams, and different clinical phenotypes to be evaluated simultaneously looking for the possible development of stroke.   ### The Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS) Problem and an AI Driven Personalized Medicine Solution  Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) affects ~12% of the US adult population, accounting for $10-13 billion in direct costs and $20 billion in indirect costs annually. Its large quality of life (QoL) burden results from nasal symptoms of obstruction, drainage, smell loss, and facial pain, as well as systemic issues including sleep difficulty, cognitive dysfunction, fatigue, depression, and asthma exacerbation. Traditional CRS management follows a linear algorithm ending with the consideration for treatment escalation to surgery when symptoms are not adequately controlled by medical therapies. However, in chronic diseases where different therapeutic options exist, there is a need for individualized evidence-based decision support at the point-of-care. Therefore, we hypothesize that application of artificial intelligence machine learning (ML/AI) can be used to uncover patterns.   ### Stochastic Games, AI, and Cybersecurity  Stochastic games have been widely used to study network security where the attacker and the defender are considered as the players in the game. This proposal aims to study the existence of game theoretical equilibrium strategies in a stochastic game with a ﬁnite state space and ﬁnite action sets, and then apply the game theory analysis in Cybersecurity applications. AI algorithms will be employed to compute the equilibrium solutions of such multi-player games in a more eﬃcient way. Also, multi-agent reinforcement learning can be studied well in the multi-player game of the cybersecurity problem.   ### Leveraging Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to Reduce Disparities in Suicide Trajectories: A BioPsychosocial Approach to Identify Modifiable Risk and Protective Processes  This interdisciplinary project will use state-of-art machine learning techniques to identify modifiable risk and protective processes in suicidal trajectories from a biopsychosocial perspective. By leveraging artificial intelligence in unique multimodal data across the biomedical image, social networks, clinical, psychological, and behavioral domains collected over time, this study will ultimately produce an easy-to-interpret, culturally appropriate, and accessible tool to clinicians, social workers, community health practitioners, and policymakers in suicide prevention programs. With close collaboration between social work and AI experts, this project will make fundamental scientific contributions to computer or information sciences, social, behavioral, cognitive, and economics. The team will address the alarming disparities in suicide across developmental trajectories from children, adolescents to young adults. The integrated algorithm will allow clinicians, families, teachers, and community health practitioners to identify young people at risk before them being in crisis so that clinicians can intervene earlier, which could have a significant contribution. The findings of this project will advance understanding of how AI-learning computation, combined with advances in social, psychological, and biomedical data analysis. Clinically, it will improve our knowledge of the origins, modifiable risks, and protective processes of disparities in suicide trajectories.   ## Papers from iAI seed funding  [https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2022.3146715](https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2022.3146715)  [https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-022-04167-8](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-022-04167-8)  [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.231026](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.231026)  [https://doi.org/10.3390/electronicmat3020017](https://doi.org/10.3390/electronicmat3020017)  [https://doi.org/10.4271/2022-01-0790](https://doi.org/10.4271/2022-01-0790)  [https://doi.org/10.4271/2021-01-0255](https://doi.org/10.4271/2021-01-0255)  [https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/QNEKM](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/QNEKM) "

    "body": "  ## LIS-S 622 Resources and Services for People with Disabilities  3 credits  [schedule](https://sisjee.iu.edu/sisigps-prd/web/igps/course/search/)   ### Description  Access to information is essential for sustained independence of people with disabilities. This course studies materials, services, and assistive technologies to support this access. National and state initiatives related to people with disabilities increasingly stress maximization of their independence, whether in school, employment, or daily living environments. This course will focus on access to information as a critical element to sustained independence. Topics covered will include specific materials, services, and assistive technologies available to meet the needs of various types of disabilities.   ### Program Learning Goals Supported  Instructors map their courses to specific LIS Program Goals . Mapped program goals drive the design of each course and what students can expect to generally learn.  [LIS Program Goals](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/masters/mlis/program-goals.html)   ### Learning Outcomes  Instructors develop learning outcomes for their courses. Students can expect to be able to achieve the learning outcomes for a given course after successfully completing the course.   ### Course Overview  Instruction is in Canvas. Lessons are organized into Modules whose length may vary.  Module 1: Introduction to disability & assistive technology | Principle: Laws & History  Towards a definition of disabilities.  Module 2: Disability: Vision & Hearing | Principle: Universal Design & web accessibility  Disabilities related to vision and hearing are considered sensory disabilities.  These conditions vary widely from person to person and often defy the stereotypes of people who are considered \"blind, visually impaired, Deaf, hard of hearing, or Deaf-Blind\".  The last time an automated door opened for you, you read the captions on a television at the gym, or rolled a bike, shopping cart, or baby stroller up a curb cut, you benefitted from Universal Design.  The last time you noticed a title when you hovered over an image on a web site, you benefitted from web site accessibility.  Although there are a number of assistive technologies to increase the independence of people with disabilities when accessibility barriers appear, there are also a number of design considerations that can help avoid those barriers in the first place.  In this module we will explore the concepts of Universal Design and Web accessibility which can help use change the world by removing barriers to accessibility before they appear.  Module 3: Disability: Physical disabilities | Principle: UDL  Physical disabilities are often some of the most apparent disabilities among the general public.  We routinely see people in wheelchairs, using canes, crutches, or walkers, and can make some basic assumptions about that person and their disability.  The more we become familiar with individuals with disabilities, the more we may realize that our assumptions are incorrect. In this module we get to know several individuals with physical disabilities and gain insight into what their lives are really like.  We will also explore some of the assistive technologies that can help to increase independence.  Note: In this section we will explore several resources from Australia, a country with a very forward thinking approach to physical disabilities.  Universal Design for Learning (UDL) takes the concept of Universal Design (UD) into the realm of teaching and learning.  UDL is based on brain science and, when done correctly, makes learning more universally available to everyone with and without disabilities.  UDL also can reduce the need for assistive technology.  UDL is practiced most often in K-12 educational institutions but is based on concepts that are applicable for nearly any learning environment.  Module 4: Disability: Autism, Intellectual, Behavior & Learning Disabilities | Principle: AT assessment  Autism, intellectual disabilities, behavioral challenges and learning disabilities are among the most commonly occurring disabilities but sometimes the least understood.  They often go unnoticed or misunderstood as simply social phenomena.  The diagnosis of Autism has rapidly increased in recent years and is often found in news headlines.  In this module we will gain more insight into the lives of people with these categories of disabilities and the technologies and services available to increase their independence.  Having the wrong tool for the job almost always leads to struggle or failure.  Selecting the correct assistive technology is critically important to people with disabilities.  AT assessments are often done by educators, physical, occupational, or speech therapists, assistive technology professionals or other qualified practitioners. In this module we will develop familiarity with two of the tools that are often used for AT assessments, the SETT framework and the WATI Assessment tool.  Then we will complete a mini-AT assessment on a real or hypothetical AT user, with a modified and simplified version of the SETT framework.  Module 5: Disability: Communication | Principle: Advocacy  Communication is essential to life.  There are many disabilities in which communication challenges might occur.  For the purposes of this module we are going to focus on one of the most prevalent communication methods supported by assistive technology: Augmentative and Alternative Communication; also known as Aug-Comm, AAC, or sometimes among children \"talkers\".  Disability rights has a long and rich history.  As a people, we still have work to do. Advocacy related to disability is about our history as well as understanding the issues and skillful communication.  Module 6: Disability: Multiple disabilities | Principle: Resources  Disability, accessibility, and assistive technology are all fields that continually change.  Although the principles don't shift often, the methods in which they are addressed change rapidly.  In this module, we will cover a few guidelines for identifying resources as well as some of the more common disability-related resources. Please note that several have been covered in previous modules but will be repeated here in an effort to create a centralized resource; we have certainly not covered them all.  It is also worth noting that in many cases, a single individual may have multiple disabilities.  In some cases, congenital disabilities occur simultaneously.  In other cases, disabilities progress resulting in multiple instances of disabilities (consider vision, neurological, or mobility challenges that might arise from diabetes). In yet other cases, a person with a disability ages and develops additional age-related disabilities.  In these cases, multiple-disabilities are the result and present unique considerations.   ### Policies and Procedures  Please be aware of the following linked policies and procedures.

    "body": "  ## Informatics and Human-Computer Interaction Ph.D. Candidates to Participate in Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing  January 29, 2013  The School of Informatics and Computing’ Romisa Rohani Ghahari and Afarin Pirzadeh, two doctoral candidates in Informatics with a specialization in Human-Computer Interaction, will participate in the renowned Doctoral Consortium at the Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing 2013. The event is scheduled for February 7-10 in Washington, DC.    The Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing brings together leading and diverse researchers to present and to discuss the latest developments and advances impacting the field of computing. The conference also provides a uniquely supportive networking environment for under-represented groups across the broad range of computing and information technology. The Doctoral Consortium provides an opportunity for doctoral students to discuss and explore their research interests and career objectives with a panel of established researchers in computing, computational mathematics, science and engineering.  The 2013 conference is organized by the Coalition to Diversify Computing and sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery and in cooperation with the IEEE Computer Society and the Computing Research Association.  Both Ghahari and Pirzadeh were selected based upon the strength of their research. Gharani’s work focuses on eyes-free mobile navigation of technology using aural user interfaces. It allows users to access and listen to web content while engaged in other tasks through the use of auditory cues and vocal commands.  Pirzadeh’s research centers on improving emotion expression and comprehension within text-based, computer-mediated communication, such as instant message chats, through improved conceptual design and realization.  The event is inspired by Richard Tapia, a first-generation Mexican-American who went on to become an internationally-known researcher and educator in computational and mathematical sciences. Among his many honors, Tapia was the first Hispanic elected to the National Academy of Engineering. In 1996, President Clinton appointed him to the National Science Board, where he served until 2002, and from 2001 to 2004 he chaired the National Research Council’s Board on Higher Education and the Workforce. He was also the first recipient of the Computing Research Association’s A. Nico Habermann Award for outstanding contribution to aiding members of underrepresented groups within the computing research community.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Dr. Rich Holden featured in Annals of Emergency Medicine  January 29, 2015  Dr. Rich Holden, Assistant Professor of Health Informatics at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, was recently featured in a top industry journal for a study he conducted investigating patients with acute heart failure and self-care issues.  Dr. Holden along with a team of researchers from Vanderbilt University, designed a tool to assess what interferes with acute heart failure patients’ ability to care for themselves after hospital discharge, which holds promise for improving patient outcomes and reducing re-admissions to the hospital.  The patient survey was published online Tuesday in Annals of Emergency Medicine , along with patient responses that shed light on the non-medical issues that limit patients’ ability to care for themselves (http://www.annemergmed.com/article/S0196-0644(14)01655-2/fulltext).  “In order to reduce the number of patients returning to the emergency department for heart failure exacerbations, we need a better handle on what they can and cannot do for themselves after hospital discharge and why,” said lead study author Richard Holden, PhD, of Indiana University in Indianapolis, Ind.  “More than three-quarters of acute heart failure patients in the ER are experiencing exacerbation of their condition, not something new.   Many of those exacerbations are the result of self-care challenges, including inadequate access to medications or lack of knowledge, which theoretically can be modified for the better.”  Dr. Holden and his team surveyed 31 acute heart failure patients who visited the emergency department.  Of 47 different self-care barriers (such as transportation problems, insurance problems and caregiver responsibilities), an average of 15 per patient were indicated as sometimes or often present.  Thirty-three of the barriers were reported by at least 25 percent of all patients.  The top 10 most prevalent barriers were:  Weather, physical obstacles and a food culture incompatible with dietary restrictions were also frequently mentioned as barriers to self-care.  Certain barriers also compound each other.  In one example, a patient was sick but also taking care of others and working full time, leaving little time for her own self-care.  “The first step in addressing these barriers is to develop a focused, valid and feasible measurement instrument for self-care barriers in the ER,” said Dr. Holden.  “The social determinants of health, along with factors such as poverty and a lack of transportation, must be addressed in order to improve the ER bounce-back rate for acute heart failure patients.”  Annals of Emergency Medicine is the peer-reviewed scientific journal for the American College of Emergency Physicians, the national medical society representing emergency medicine. ACEP is committed to advancing emergency care through continuing education, research, and public education. Headquartered in Dallas, Texas, ACEP has 53 chapters representing each state, as well as Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. A Government Services Chapter represents emergency physicians employed by military branches and other government agencies. For more information, visit www.acep.org.

    "body": "  ## Informatics and Computing Assists IU School of Nursing in Big-Data Research About Health and Wellness  February 12, 2015  Indiana University School of Nursing and ChaCha have joined in a partnership to provide Indiana University researchers access to anonymous, de-identified questions from the ChaCha question and answer service in order to better understand a variety of health and cultural topics.  The unique nature of the ChaCha data, composed entirely of questions submitted by users on a wide range of subjects from 2009 to 2012, will provide researchers with unparalleled access to the public’s questions about health and wellness.  The data-sharing agreement has led to the creation of the Social Network Health Research Lab at Indiana University School of Nursing on the IUPUI campus. It is an interdisciplinary laboratory composed of researchers from the IU schools of nursing, informatics and computing, and liberal arts. Leveraging the advanced computing methods available at Indiana University, the lab’s initial projects will involve mining the ChaCha data set to understand how ChaCha users ask about health and wellness.  “This extraordinary partnership with ChaCha will allow IU researchers to amplify the patient voice in understanding health conditions,” said Chad Priest, Social Network Health Research Lab director and principal investigator. “We will be able to match anonymous social network information with aggregate health outcomes to map health-related dialogue occurring through social media networks.”  Michael T. Weaver, interim dean of the IU School of Nursing, sees endless possibilities for informing health care. “As researchers focused on improving the quality of life and care of our patients, the ability to understand health-related issues from the patient’s perspective is a unique opportunity. We have the potential to determine which health topics are of greatest concern, what outcomes are most desirable, and how patients view particular treatments and practices. These data have potentially great economic and health care implications.”  “Our massive data sets are uniquely able to provide insight into many types of linguistic patterns and user behavior,” ChaCha CEO Scott Jones said. “We are extremely happy to be able to work with IU School of Nursing to create this new lab.”  “We want to use a data set as large as this one to improve population health on a very large scale,” said Janet S. Carpenter, associate dean for research at IU School of Nursing. “That’s a very exciting new vista to explore, and along with improved health and the ability to expand IU School of Nursing’s research into new areas, it also means more jobs for Hoosiers.”  “Discovering usable information from the ChaCha text data poses an interesting and exciting Big Data challenge in informatics utilizing natural language processing (text mining),” said Mathew Palakal, executive associate dean and professor  in the School of Informatics and Computing. “Researchers require real-time exploration of the data, and hence, complex text-mining algorithms based on Hadoop computing platforms will be developed in order to facilitate active research on the ChaCha data.”  Article courtesy of School of Nursing, Sally Kraus skrause@iu.edu.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

His thesis proposal under supervision of Dr. Mathew Palakal, with collaboration of Dr. C. Max Schmidt at IU School of Medicine and Regenstrief Institute, outlines early identification of pancreatic cancer using NLP algorithms and risk stratification of patients with pancreatic cysts using machine learning techniques.  Using longitudinal records of patients, they identified two subpopulations of patients that are most susceptible to getting the disease – those with hereditary factors or those that had pancreatic cysts, and then proposed a methodology to identify temporal phenotypic patterns in those who develop pancreatic cancer and risk stratify them based on various clinical features extracted from their clinical records.  While pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. it is the deadliest. Despite advances in surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, 90% of patients die. Although there is no cure at this time, it can be prevented in patients with a hereditary predisposition as well as those with pre-cancerous cysts. With the implementation of this proposed system, physicians will be able to make an earlier diagnosis and treatment.  The development and implementation of the system will be conducted by the Regenstrief Institute in conjunction with local hospitals.  The criteria used for presentations were 15 minutes to present, followed by 15 minutes of structured comments by the panel of experts and discussions. Presenters were evaluated by their presentation, significance, innovation, approach, and environment.  AMIA aims to lead the way in transforming health care through trusted science, education, and the practice of informatics and connects a broad community of professionals and students interested in informatics. AMIA is the bridge for knowledge and collaboration across a continuum, from basic and applied research to the consumer and public health arenas.  This year’s annual AMIA Conference was held November 16-20 in Washington, D.C.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Networking, preparation, and timing leads MAS grad to rewarding career at Netflix  July 5, 2019  Kylee Peña (MAS, 2009) has accomplished a great deal in the field of Media Arts and Sciences in the short time since her graduation. She is the Coordinator of the Creative Technologies team at Netflix in Los Angeles, California, and co-President of the non-profit organization Blue Collar Post Collective. Peña generously spent time telling us of her career path to Netflix, her important work supporting emerging talent in the post production field, and the path that brought her to SoIC.  “I was interested in computers as early as I can remember,” says Peña. “I used to ride my bike to a library to use the internet and check out books on HTML! We got our first home computer in 1998, and I immediately went to work digging into the technical side to fuel creative projects. A year or so later, my parents gave me a video camera. And I had been a Drama Club nerd since birth, too. All these things converged into a love of video production: acting out stories and trying to make them work creatively and technically – long before easy streaming export presets and platforms like YouTube existed!” This convergence ended up leading her to the Human-Centered Computing program at SoIC.  “IUPUI appealed to me because of the location and the combination of video and computing. I knew I would need to do internships to be successful in the industry, and staying in my small town wasn’t an option because there weren’t any production companies. Going to a school in Indianapolis offered me a lot of options for interning, working my way through school (at the Indianapolis Zoo, an amazing workplace for a student), and living in different neighborhoods. It seemed to me like a strong technical background was going to be important for creating a strong career baseline, so the School of Informatics’ curriculum stood out to me,” Peña said.  Her training, hard work and ambition eventually landed her at Netflix. Peña remembers: “I came to work for Netflix like I got every other opportunity in the industry: networking, preparation, and good timing. I’m very involved in the community and attend or participate in industry events whenever possible. The not-so-secret to success: these events aren’t just for adding LinkedIn connections, they’re for developing real relationships. People are people, not commodities, and they want to hire people they like who are also incredibly good at their jobs.” Her current position is Coordinator of the Creative Technologies team. “The Creative Technologies team advocates for best practices and high production standards, evolves the tools and craft of motion picture production, and ensures that Netflix Originals achieve the optimal viewing experience and greatest longevity possible. In short, if it’s a technology that is used by creatives – on set, in post, in the machine room, anywhere – we work with it, including researching, evaluating, educating, and developing best practices and standards relating to all this technology,” Peña explains. “I help to project manage the team and bring cohesion to all these projects all happening simultaneously.”  Peña is passionate about providing support to new talent emerging in her field, and one of the ways she provides this support is through her role as co-President of the Blue Collar Post Collective. “Blue Collar Post Collective is a grassroots non-profit organization that seeks to support emerging talent in post production. It’s the only non-profit that works for this underserved group, which consists of a far more diverse body of individuals than are generally seen in more traditionally visible positions. That’s because underrepresented people are less likely to be able to do a lot of unpaid work or less likely to benefit from casual mentorship from people who look like them. They work swing shift and overnights, so they can’t take advantage of workshops that happen during evenings through the week – if they can even afford them, since they’re paid less, too! So they struggle through early-to-mid career and tend to leave the industry in much greater numbers. BCPC breaks all these barriers and tries to open the door wider for everyone through regular meet-ups in several cities, lots of online activity especially on Facebook, and free educational events. We also have a charitable program called the Professional Development Accessibility Program, which sends lower income professionals to important industry events where they belong.”  Peña has not only helped lead this organization for the past several years, she has overseen its tremendous growth as well, with membership numbers rising from 4,000 to over 12,000 members during her tenure as co-President. “I helped to bring the organization to Los Angeles from its roots in New York and grew it to London and Adelaide, Australia… Working with emerging talent is important to me because my “emerging” years were especially hard. I was underpaid, overworked, and often directionless. Being from the midwest and from a blue collar upbringing, I didn’t have connections in the industry or a clear path. And I had a tremendous amount of privilege to leverage.”  Peña’s work with BCPC illustrates her excitement about the students and recent graduates who make up the future workforce in Media Technology. “Earlier this year, I participated in a career day event with SMPTE (Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers) and got a chance to hang out with graduating seniors across Southern California,” Peña remembers. “I was amazed at the kinds of questions they were asking me about media and technology because they were looking at angles I had never considered. They demonstrated an interest and empathy in people and the environment that is not common in the industry. They acknowledged the social responsibility of storytellers and those who enable them – because stories can unite us and expose us to so many perspectives and change the world. For like a hundred years, the majority of people in control of above AND below-the-line jobs have all looked the same and thought the same. This hasn’t been changing quickly enough, but we’re beginning to see a potential tipping point. The world is better for it.” She also shared one final piece of advice for our students: “Remember: a college education is only one part of a successful career. You’ve got lots more to do, and you won’t accomplish it alone. Find your team and get to work.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Applied Data Science alumna making it rain for Milwaukee Bucks  October 22, 2021  When the Milwaukee Bucks finished their 2020 season as NBA champs, School of Informatics and Computing graduate Gabriel Wachowski was there courtside to celebrate. Although her “assists” are more behind the scenes—doing data modeling, for example—she is a valuable member of the Bucks organization and contributor to their success.  Wachowski is a Research and Innovation Analyst for the Bucks, where she mostly focuses on scouting. She says she has learned a lot from working with NBA scouts, some of whom have been in basketball longer than she’s been alive. Her intention is to continue working her way up in the organization, maybe pivoting to other sports, and she wants to help pave the way for more women to feel welcome. To that end, she has been involved in the NBA’s program to expand diversity in the league.  Before applying to the Bucks, Wachowski was regularly checking team job pages. She also found a connection on LinkedIn and reached out to her now boss to inquire more about the position. Her past internship with the Indiana Pacers and class experience with the Indy Eleven also prepared her for working in the sports field.  “My class with Dr. Pierce was another great one because we worked closely with the Indy Eleven USL soccer team and got to gain more experience working with people in sports,” she said. Proximity to Indianapolis was one of the main reasons she chose the Applied Data Science Sports Analytics master’s program at IUPUI.  [Applied Data Science Sports Analytics](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/data-science/sports-analytics-masters/)  In particular, Wachowski says she benefited from her database-focused courses because the department she now works in with the Bucks is brand new and building out their data infrastructure.  “Overall, the job has been absolutely incredible. I definitely feel like having my master’s was extremely important to being ready for the job that I have. My classes at IUPUI and my internship were both instrumental to where I am today,” Wachowski said.     ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

It’s the first time the school has offered something like this for high school teachers in which informatics, media arts and science and human-centered computing faculty share their expertise on several relevant topics like how to bring science to life through animation, how 3D printing can shape education in the classroom, and using online teaching for snow days.  “The response was instant. Teachers understand the positive impact the use of technology can have in the classroom. The ability to use animation and 3D modelling to illustrate complex concepts or systems can help students understand things they would otherwise not be able to observe. Online teaching techniques will allow instruction to take place on days when classes would be cancelled due to bad weather. The Summit is a great opportunity to gain insight first-hand from our faculty who specialize in these key areas,” said Vicki Daugherty, Associate Director of Recruitment and Diversity at the School of Informatics and Computing.  Attendees will begin their day with the Informatics and Computing faculty sharing their expertise in an overview of the subject areas including demonstrations.  In the afternoon, there will be a tour of the Informatics Complex including the Advanced Visualization Lab, Virtual Reality Theater, and Media Arts Research and Learning Arcade before jumping into hands-on breakout sessions where teachers will develop new skills that they can take back to the classroom.  The summit is FREE to high school teachers and begins at 9 a.m. in the Informatics and Communications Technology Complex, 535 W. Michigan St. on the IUPUI campus.  For more information about the Summit or to register, contact Vicki Daugherty at vdaugher@iupui.edu.

[Khairi Reda](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/khairi-reda/)  These techniques will help scientists with data and questions about it to see their data in new ways, Reda says. His goal is to ultimately spur discovery by making data accessible and empowering humans to look at it more deeply, as opposed to having computers crunching alone.  Davide Bolchini , chair of the Human-Centered Computing (HCC) Department says of Reda, “The highly competitive NSF CRII award seeds a novel and very timely line of research in broadening the conceptual tools for hypothesis-based visual analytics. We are all very proud of his accomplishment.” The Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) Research Initiation Initiative (CRII) is meant to support early-career faculty in establishing research independence.  [Davide Bolchini](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/davide-bolchini/)  Existing visualization tools typically support only a narrow style of analysis—like a one-way street—where computers generate plots, people look at them, and possibly update them. This style is useful when scientists have little previous knowledge of what questions to ask or what the data may hold.  According to Reda, most scientists tend to have developed prior hypotheses and models, and are often looking to see how well the data fits these models. In particular, they are interested in closely examining instances where the data violates their assumptions, as these so-called data violations could provide alternative explanations and potentially lead to new discoveries. However, current visualization tools don’t allow this process to occur naturally; they show the data generically, making it difficult for viewers to evaluate the fit of the data to their own hypotheses.  Reda proposes re-architecting data visualization tools to support bi-directional analysis. In this new paradigm, analysts will be able to share their hypotheses and models with the system. The system will then generate visualizations that are directly responsive to those inputs, while visually emphasizing any discrepancy between data and models.  An example is the study of gene mutations involved in a particular type of cancer and the order in which they are expressed. Rather than including all gene expression for which there is data, the researcher could inform the system about just the gene mutations thought to be involved in the disease, and specify the suspected chronology of gene expression. Given this information, the system would correlate gene activation levels with the patient’s disease stage and automatically highlight instances where activation occurs earlier or later than expected. Non-conforming data could be explored further to discover the underlying reasons for any discrepancies, possibly leading to the identification of a new cancer pathway.  Reda’s research team will first need to discover how people could intuitively but accurately express their models and hypotheses to the data analytics system. The project will therefore begin with developing an understanding of how people come to form hypotheses about data, and will involve testing of various expression techniques—from natural language to concept mapping and graphical sketching. Human-centered design methods will be utilized throughout the study to iteratively develop and validate system prototypes.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

We know what a huge impact they make on IUPUI, the Indianapolis community, and the world. As a result, we are excited but not surprised to see the work of these two exceptional students honored by the campus. They have made a profound difference in our school through their work and research. We could not be more proud!”   ### Nicholas Dibley  Dibley has had several leadership roles at IUPUI, as SAAC president, Horizon League SAAC secretary, IUPUI swim team captain and Team Impact representative, as well as secretary of the Bioinformatics Club. In addition, he has volunteered at the Children’s Museum of Indianapolis, the Indianapolis Zoo, Indianapolis Convention Center, Riley Children’s Hospital, and St. John the Evangelist Catholic Church. He is also a member of the Honors College.  Dibley said he chose his undergraduate major because it was a perfect combination of everything that he was looking for; namely, computer science, health and the human body, and math. After investigating Biomedical Informatics a bit more, he discovered IUPUI’s accelerated program through which he could also obtain a master’s degree in a total of five years.  Following graduate school, Dibley plans on working at a research institution as a Bioinformatics Research Scientist. Genetic disease such cystic fibrosis has always piqued his interest and he believes that fully diving into research in this area will yield great results. “The many connections that IUPUI has to offer around Indy is just one of many examples of how this program could jump start my career and help me reach my goals.  For as long as I have known about this major, I have wanted to conduct my own research on genetic disease. Graduating with a Master’s Degree in Bioinformatics from IUPUI would give me the tools and resources to do just that,” he said.  [Master’s Degree in Bioinformatics](https://luddy.iupui.edu/biohealth/graduate/bioinformatics/masters/)   ### Sahar Abdullah  Abdullah has been active on campus as an SoIC student ambassador and an iDEW (Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce) high school mentor, and helped restart the Women in Tech student organization fall semester 2021. She has also been a teaching assistant for science classes and performed research with bioinformatics professor Jingwen Yan , studying differential gene expression of genes involved in Alzheimer’s disease. In addition, Abdullah was the undergraduate student recipient of the 2022 Women’s History Month Recognition Award at IUPUI.  [Jingwen Yan](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/jingwen-yan/)  “While I was in high school, I attended the SoIC open houses, capstone events, and other programs. At these events, I was exposed to all the opportunities that SoIC has to offer. The students and staff were always very welcoming and informative. I participated in the SoIC summer camps as well, and these great experiences prompted me to do my own research on SoIC when choosing a major. The incorporation of technology and biological sciences is what drew me to biomedical informatics,” Abdullah said.  Abdullah’s future plans are to work in the health care field and utilize biomedical informatics.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

Its main purpose is to present opportunities to people from underrepresented sections of society and diverse backgrounds.  [Sports Marketing Workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR4AiUtZBwI)  [Marcus Graham Project](https://www.nba.com/pacers/news/pacers-sports-entertainment-and-marcus-graham-project-partner-bring-industry-experience)  During the four-day event, the group had the opportunity to connect with top executives from PSE as well as alumni from MGP. Not only did participants get to be a part of multiple panel discussions where the panelists shared their career journeys and experiences, they also had the opportunity to directly interact with and speak to these distinguished professionals about how they could shape their careers and what they could learn from them.  Kapoor shared how PSE really laid out the red carpet for everyone. Participants had the opportunity to go on a behind-the-scenes stadium tour and see the various departments that work together to make sure that game day events can take place effectively. They also got to watch the Pacers play the Chicago Bulls and the Orlando Magic and, on another occasion, step out on the court to shoot some hoops as well. On the first day of the workshop, each participant was welcomed onto the court with their name and picture on the big screen and was greeted by Boomer, the official Mascot, handing out a Pacers jersey with their name on the back.  Finally, as part of the workshop, participants got to work on a real-life marketing project that the PSE group would build upon. PSE is currently creating a Plaza outside the Gainbridge Fieldhouse and wanted the participants to work in groups to create an integrated marketing campaign for two separate events: a tip-off event to serve as the inauguration and an annual event to use the Plaza space to bring together people from different backgrounds to enjoy activities. Each group had to work on their ideas, create a presentation, and finally pitch their concept to the judges at the end of the workshop.  “Overall, the workshop was a truly unbelievable experience as I got to learn so much more than marketing skills. Being in the same room as high-performing individuals who have excelled in their careers allowed me to pick up a lot of intangible skills and values that will be essential in my personal journey,” Kapoor said.  Kapoor said he chose to pursue his master’s in Applied Data Science with a specialization in Sports Analytics from IUPUI for two main reasons: The Data Science curriculum will help him acquire the much needed technical skills to work in this industry, and the sports-related opportunities that are present in the city of Indianapolis are a perfect addition for potential to network and attend workshops such as this.  [Applied Data Science with a specialization in Sports Analytics](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/data-science/sports-analytics-masters/)  “To me, Indianapolis is a city that has a perfect blend of passion for sports and expertise in tech which is why it feels like the right place for me to build my career as a Sports Analyst, ” Kapoor said. “I see data as the most valuable commodity in the world right now, where applications for decision-making are profound in each industry, and along with my passion for sports—having played and watched professional sports all my life—this feels like the most appropriate industry for me to build a career in.”  Watch a WISH-TV interview with Shayna Sangster, Director of Marketing, PS&E  [Watch a WISH-TV interview with Shayna Sangster, Director of Marketing, PS&E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7jYc1PVAog)   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Award furthers professor’s work with health tracking tools to benefit Black Americans  January 4, 2021  Exercise equipment, eating plans, sleep trackers—all have their place in promoting a healthy lifestyle. But to be effective, we have to use them.  Promoting heart-healthy habits is the goal of Aqueasha Martin-Hammond, Ph.D., who has received a Google Award for Inclusion Research. The $60,000 inaugural award is in partnership with a co-principal investigator, Tanjala S. Purnell, MPH, Ph.D., at the Johns Hopkins University schools of public health and medicine.  As an assistant professor with the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, Martin-Hammond’s research focuses on human-computer interaction, and designing technology to assist individuals with health, wellness, and accessibility challenges as they age.  Her Google Award project, “Culturally Relevant Collaborative Health Tracking Tools for Motivating Heart-Healthy Behaviors Among African-Americans,” is aimed at improving cardiovascular health among underserved populations.  Martin-Hammond will investigate strategies for supporting collaborative digital health tracking for African-Americans by examining ways to design, translate, and scale an evidence-based, community health program.   ### From the Underground Railroad to digital technology  The original program, developed by epidemiologist and registered nurse Dr. Jeanne Charleston and colleagues, uses inspirational stories from the Underground Railroad to motivate heart-healthy behaviors among members. Martin-Hammond and her team will examine how digital technology can be integrated to better support both participants and community health workers.  According to the American Heart Association, the No. 1. killer for all Americans is heart disease, and stroke is also a leading cause of death. The risks of developing those diseases are even higher for Black Americans. In 2017, Black Americans were 20 percent more likely to die from heart disease than non-Hispanic whites, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health.  The incidence of chronic illness is also higher among older adults, but early assessment and risk reduction can be key to lifelong prevention and management,  even in later years.   ### Creating tools that are accessible to all  In her Google Award research, “I will focus on investigating inclusive digital strategies to improve culturally relevant content delivery and communication among participants and community-health workers involved in the program,” Martin-Hammond says, “considering digital literacy, technology access, and existing communication challenges participants may encounter.  “From this work, we hope to learn more about designing collaborative digital tracking tools that support groups with diverse technology experiences and access,” she adds, “and that motivate heart-healthy behaviors among groups, such as African-Americans, at high risk of major cardiovascular disease.”  In addition, Martin-Hammond says, “We hope to uncover barriers to participation and strategies for addressing those barriers so that these tools are more accessible to all.”   ### A highly selective honor  “It is wonderful to see this prestigious Google Award for Inclusion being received by Aqueasha,” says Davide Bolchini, Professor and Chair of the Department of Human-Centered Computing. “Only 16 projects world-wide have been bestowed this highly selective award by Google, an important recognition of the significance and positive societal impact of Aqueasha’s research project.  “This work builds nicely on her research engagement with older adults to design new user interface approaches to improve their well-being, especially in underrepresented communities.”     ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Yan receives NSF grant to develop novel tools for mining complex biological data  July 25, 2018  Jingwen Yan, assistant professor of bioinformatics in the BioHealth Informatics Department, has been awarded a two-year, $174,831 CISE Research Initiation Initiative (CRII) grant by the National Science Foundation. Yan is principal investigator and will work with several bioinformatics Ph.D. students on the project.  Multi-omic data and systems biology networks—genome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome—hold the potential for discovering new disease mechanisms and markers for designing new drugs and treatment protocols. However, the large scale and complexity has made it very difficult to harness these data sets. Yan proposes to develop a novel, data-intensive computational framework to analyze and integrate the data and networks, create predictive models, and reveal their associations.  “Instead of exploring individual genetic markers followed by enrichment analysis, our new model allows researchers to directly detect disease-related genes with close functional connections in one step.  Therefore, it has a great potential to yield novel discoveries in disease research,” Yan said.   ### Creating powerful, advanced tools  Yan’s project, entitled “Computational Methods to Mine Multi-omic Data for Systems Biology of Complex Diseases,” is expected to result in new methods and tools that effectively integrate heterogeneous, high-dimensional -omic data. Strategic extraction of knowledge in this manner will pave the way for further understanding of biological mechanisms and provide a valuable resource for disease research, with far-reaching economic and societal impacts.  The knowledge extracted can also suggest surrogate biomarkers for therapeutic trials to design new drugs and treatment protocols.  The team will first develop scalable and efficient algorithms to solve the model, and then apply and evaluate the models using a real biomedical data set, the NIH Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initative (ADNI) cohort. They will analyze genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, microarray and protein expression data from cerebrospinal fluid and blood, metabolite concentration, cognitive performance, and brain imaging measures.  Specifically, Yan’s project will address data-intensive analysis issues of scalability, multi-source data integration, and network analysis that have challenged conventional methodologies. Yan’s approach—integrating large-scale machine learning, network science, and data-intensive computing—offers an innovative solution. “Integrative -omics holds great promise to illuminate the causal pathways from genotype to phenotype,” she says.   #### Acknowledgment  This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1755836. Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## What is Full-Stack Development? Luddy IUPUI students explain it all, front to back  July 12, 2023    Summer Sexton (pictured above), and Marielle Harrell are rising seniors enrolled in double majors, studying for their B.S. in Informatics and B.S. in Media Arts & Science (Web Design & Development Concentration), aka Full-Stack Development . For those unfamiliar, Sexton explained, “In web development, there are two sides to the coin. You have your front-end, which is essentially everything a user can see or directly interact with. This is usually written in languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You also have your back-end. This side works with the data. You’ll work with languages like PHP and MySql on this side. These are the people that know how to pull information from a database all the way on the other side of a country, and how to put it into the skeleton and design that the front-end designers have made. So to keep it short and simple, the front-end is everything people see. They’re your actors and the play itself. The back-end is all the ropes behind-the-scenes to make it all come together, they’re the techies who are working on the lightboards and bringing props on-and-off the stage.”  [Full-Stack Development](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/undergraduate/full-stack-developer/)  Harrell said, “Going back to high school, I wasn’t sure of what major I wanted to study until the month of July, less than a month from my first day of college. A big influence of going into the STEM field was my Computer Science teacher, Mrs. Ehresman. She was the one who introduced me to these job possibilities. During that summer, I researched what IUPUI offers. I found that Luddy, formerly SoIC, was offering a new major called Full-Stack. When reading the description, it sounded like an opportunity that I didn’t want to miss out on. Who doesn’t want to say that they graduated from Luddy with two degrees in three and a half to four years?”  Sexton had slightly different reasons for choosing the major. “I’ve always been a big nerd. I want to learn a little bit about everything, and that has always been true. I could never be happy just learning about one side of a program. For example, I was a theatre kid in high school. I couldn’t just simply be on the acting side, I also had to get into tech theatre to see what that was like. The same principle has applied when it comes to development for me. I was never satisfied learning just about front-end development. I also wanted to learn about the back-end of development, I wanted to learn about UX/UI design, database design…I wanted to know it all. For me, it helps me become a more well-rounded individual so that no matter what part of development I eventually go into, I’m able to communicate with anybody on the team because I have a fundamental understanding of their roles,” she said.  Each student had their own take on the challenges and benefits of learning full-stack skills. “One of the unique challenges is definitely figuring out how to pace yourself. When you can do it all, it can be very easy to slip into a mindset of actually doing it all. But most of the time, that simply isn’t necessary. It can be really tempting to get lost in the finer details, but keeping the big picture in mind is definitely the most important. In a way, it is a benefit to be able to dream big and pin down all of the details, but at the same time, it’s very easy to make a simple project that is much more difficult because elements of it are easier. Perhaps the biggest benefit, however, is the ability it gives you to communicate with a team. When you understand what exactly a role entails, it opens much more meaningful conversations with colleagues. In our field, it’s easy to tamper back with what we talk about because we are used to speaking with people who don’t quite understand what we do. But being able to talk with someone who does makes it that much more rewarding. I like being able to provide that type of communication to the team, and even act as a sort of translator in some situations,” Sexton said.  Harrell added, “During my time at Luddy I have learned languages like HTML, JavaScript, PHP, React, etcetera. There are a lot of challenges when it comes to coding a website. I run into syntax errors, logic errors, and runtime errors all of the time. It just takes practice finding those errors and brainstorming ways to solve them. I do have trouble remembering certain things when developing, but Google, W3Schools, and videos are a good source when it comes to reminding me how to develop a site. Saying that I am able to do both front-end and back-end makes me more desirable to employers. It also gives me more opportunity when applying to jobs compared to just focusing on one end.”  Sexton chose Luddy for several reasons, the first of which was the simple fact that she didn’t have to live on campus as a freshman. “As someone who knew early on that paying for college was entirely my own responsibility, I needed to choose where I went wisely. Being able to live off-campus from the start, especially when I could commute from home or save money living in an apartment, was extremely important to me. Outside of that, Luddy Indy was known as a good program to go into if you had started in the computer science program at my high school. With word of mouth and a great financial decision working in my favor, it was an easy decision.” Harrell also appreciated the locale, “I chose to go to Luddy Indy because of the location of the school. Being located in Indianapolis, there are plenty of events and networking opportunities to grow in and attend. I was also attracted to the campus of IUPUI and could see myself being a part of the community.”  Harrell, who will graduate in December 2023, is planning her next step and said, “I do hope to quickly enter into my career in one company located in the Indianapolis area. My goal is to start out making and designing web applications. Once I have enough experience I plan on owning my own business and possibly building a well-known app that all walks of life can use.” Sexton is also exploring options. “Currently, I’m hoping to get a job in some area of development. I would love to get a full-stack development position itself, but I’m certainly going to be happy if I get a job working even with simply PHP. I’ve come to really enjoy the language and feel it would provide a better career path over simply being front-end development, but I’m not entirely turned off by the idea. One day, I’d love to come back and get my master’s degree, but I would like some time in my field first.”  Harrell and Sexton both offered advice for those considering studying full-stack development. “There are some elements of it you’ll love, and some elements of it you’re not going to enjoy as much,” Sexton said. “That’s part of any degree path that you choose, and coming into this expecting to love every little bit of it will end up hurting in the long run. But it’s also okay to not love every side of it. You’ll be learning so many fantastic skills to give you a bright future, and if anything, it lets you go to whatever area you find you love the most. It’s a way to get a broad perspective without too much sacrifice or extra course-load!”  “If you are thinking about full-stack, I would highly recommend it and say go for it. I got to meet a wide variety of people with all sorts of majors. Full-stack does sound overwhelming, but I promise you it’s not. You will still have time to do the activities that you want to do. First year of college you get exposed to all sorts of classes. You may end up liking all of them like me or discover you are more interested in one major. Really college is the time to discover yourself and your desires!,” Harrell added.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## M.L.I.S. Program Goals  Students document their achievement of the program outcomes by means of an electronic portfolio (ePort) . Completion of the ePort is required before the degree is conferred.   ### Connect Core Values and Professional Ethics to Practice  Our information society requires its citizens to be able to search, access, retrieve, and use data and information in their personal and professional lives, but there is a difference between ethical data and information practices and those that contravene norms, policies, and laws. Therefore, it is necessary for future library and information science professionals to be able to connect core values to the work they do and the publics they serve. Our core values include: access, confidentiality/privacy, democracy, diversity, education and lifelong learning, intellectual freedom, preservation, the public good, professionalism, service, social responsibility, stewardship, and sustainability.   ### Facilitate Engagement in the Information Ecosystem  Information professionals are first and foremost competent users of all aspects of the information ecosystem. This ecosystem includes the skills, processes and conceptual understandings of information, technology, media, data, visual, and graphic literacies that form the bedrock of information science. These conceptual foundations transfer to the development of services and resources in a variety of formats for patrons and colleagues. Information science professionals engage and assist with the identification of information questions or problems. They facilitate all aspects of information-seeking behaviors through passive support and direct development and instruction of tools, resources, and inquiry behaviors and processes. They facilitate timely informal and formal learning opportunities allowing patrons to evolve in their own abilities to navigate all types of information science literacies.   ### Curate Collections for Designated Communities  Information professionals are responsible for curating various types of information and/or collections while collaborating with diverse designated communities throughout information/data lifecycle. Curation is the selection, deselection, management, preservation, collection, and archiving of information, and it establishes, maintains, and adds values to information for present and future use. Curation is essential stewardship to enhance and maintain the long-term value of data, information, and collection.   ### Lead and Manage Libraries, Archives and Other Information Organizations  Information professionals learn from the past, anticipate emerging trends, and respond proactively. They synthesize and apply management principles to address topics related to user services; intellectual property activities; collection development; human resources; finance; technology, data, and digital services; communications; space planning; community engagement, and security issues. Managers apply core values and ethics to management situations, apply organizational and change theories to address leadership functions, collaborate and build relationships inside and outside their institution; and create visions and plans (e.g., strategic, financial, project, marketing) then adapt to meet evolving needs.   ### Organize and Represent Information  Information professionals create order out of chaos through the organization of recorded knowledge and information. This includes the ability to organize and represent data and information, develop and describe information, and use existing techniques, technologies, and systems. Information professional assist with the organization and representation of information throughout the information lifecycle in order to facilitate discoverability and findability.   ### Conduct Systematic Research to Inform Decisions  Information professionals continually explore, evaluate, and create new knowledge to inform professional practices and theory. Conducting systematic research is how library and information professionals evaluate their responsibilities and institutions, prepare for future change, and benefit from the insights and discoveries of others through disseminated findings.   ### Innovate Professional Practice with Information Services and Technology  Information professionals are not only asked to meet user and organization needs with current techniques, technologies, and systems but are also strongly urged to innovate professional practice. Innovation arises through new and creative methods and procedures. Innovation can also involve the proper application of technology, for instance: established technology can be adapted in new ways for additional outcomes, and nascent technology can be recognized embraced for the services it can provide.   ### Examine Systemic Inequalities to Improve Library and Information Practices through Equitable and Socially Just Interventions  Information professionals provide services to increasingly diverse communities not only to meet information needs but also to represent the communities served. Such information professionals recognize their social justice responsibilities and, through their actions and behavior, demonstrate commitment to values of diversity, equity, inclusion, and access for their communities as well as for the workforce.

BenMessaoud’s project is “Improving student engagement, connectedness, and learning equity through AI-enhanced teaching & learning environments.”  Louie Zhu , Ph.D., Senior Lecturer, Informatics, is the other researcher on the grant.  [Louie Zhu](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/louis-zhu/)  “In teaching and learning in our undergraduate courses, we have identified three major problems dealing with students’ engagement, connectedness, and learning equity given the diversity of learners and teachers,” Principal Investigator BenMessaoud, said. “We will introduce FazBoard as an artificially intelligent teaching and learning system to address these three major problems. By integrating AI, the system leverages the potential of human and AI interaction in educational contexts. The system allows the educational stakeholders and AI tools to complement each other’s strengths to achieve educational goals and improve outcomes.”  The FazBoard system consists of two essential components: an infinite digital canvas and the AI Assistant. The digital canvas creates a teaching and learning environment. It allows a teacher to present and deliver materials to the learners synchronously or asynchronously. It also facilitates interaction and collaboration between the teacher and individual students and among students. The AI Assistant provides 24/7 instant responses to students’ inquiries. It automates the collection of student inquiries and the learning analytics. Results can be used to improve the curriculum in terms of substance, difficulty levels, delivery methods and styles.  The FazBoard system allows a teacher to focus on learning instead of teaching and to engage students through active learning using a combination of an infinite digital board and Artificial Intelligence. All students are capable of learning, BenMessaoud said, but they learn in a different way, under different conditions, and only when different instructional and pedagogical content design is applied to what they learn and how they learn. The FazBoard project aims to engage in intentional efforts to align teaching and learning activities with the diversity in classes and to ensure equitable access and learning outcomes through adaptive and active learning. The project also addresses the lack of connectedness and belated responses to students’ inquiries in a traditional teaching and learning environment. The system provides students with 24/7 on-demand instant responses through a fun and engaging conversational-driven AI Assistant persona.  Fulton’s project is ” Improving Informatics Competencies in Undergraduate and Graduate Education Using Guided Inquiry Learning by Developing a Comprehensive Educational HER.”  Saptarshi Purkayastha , Ph.D., Director of the Health Informatics program; Lisa DesNoyers , M.P.H., Director of the Health Information Management program; and Josette Jones , Ph.D., Interim Chair of the Department of BioHealth Informatics, are the other members of the research team.  [Saptarshi Purkayastha](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/saptarshi-purkayastha/)  [Lisa DesNoyers](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/lisa-desnoyers/)  [Josette Jones](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/josette-jones/)  Fulton, the Principal Investigator on the grant, said, “We will develop a robust educational electronic health record (EHR) using simulated patient data. We will then use this EHR to pilot competency-based changes in informatics courses using discipline-based education research, potentially changing the pedagogy of undergraduate and graduate informatics education. Because the Commission on Accreditation for Health Informatics and Information Management Education recognizes all three programs in the Department of BioHealth Informatics, we already have specific learning outcomes and requisite competencies mapped to each course in the curriculum. We have selected five courses from the Health Information Management program, seven courses from the Health Informatics program, and one course from the Bioinformatics program for a phased rollout for which we will develop content for guided inquiry informatics learning using EHR.”  Through the SEIRI seed grant, Fulton’s team will identify personal traits associated with undergraduate and graduate students’ attitudes about the ease of use and utility of EHRs, academic achievement, self-efficacy, and persistence in learning BioHealth competencies. In addition, they will assess the impact of teaching through process-oriented guided-inquiry learning tasks with the educational EHR on the course instructors by quantifying self-efficacy using a pre-and-post EHR use survey. To fulfill all students’ medical requirements and viewpoints, they are committed to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) in developing their educational EHR learning platform. Therefore, they will evaluate the educational EHR for accessibility and learning gains in diverse groups of learners.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Connecting via SSH (command line) or SFTP (file transfer)  Before connecting via SSH, you will first need to have a campus IP address by either being physically on campus (using campus wireless or wired connection) or using the VPN if you’re off campus or using a non-IU Internet connection while on campus. Once you have installed and activated the VPN software, your computer will be seen as part of the campus network.  [VPN](https://kb.iu.edu/d/ajrq)   ### SSH/SFTP Software  Command line versions of ssh and sftp are installed by default on Windows 10, Linux, and MacOSX.  Graphical versions are also available via IUware.  Windows:  [PuTTY](https://iuware.iu.edu/Windows/title/781)  [WinSCP](https://iuware.iu.edu/Windows/title/785)  OSX:  [Cyberduck](https://iuware.iu.edu/Mac/Title/857)   ### Connect using graphical SSH/SFTP  If you are using FileZilla, make sure that your protocol is SFTP by prepending sftp:// to the host name. This is critical as FileZilla will normally default to the unencrypted FTP protocol which will send your username and passphrase over the Internet in clear text. There are several other graphical file transfer programs which allow multiple protocols. We highly suggest using an SFTP exclusive program.   ### Command line SSH/SFTP  If you don’t have the option to download and install a graphical SFTP program, then you’ll need to use SSH or SFTP via the command line. At this point, SSH is actually the more straightforward to use.  First you will need to open a command prompt or terminal session on your local computer:  Windows 10:  From the Start Menu, Click Start, type PowerShell, and then click Windows PowerShell. or From the Start menu, click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, click the Windows PowerShell folder, and then click Windows PowerShell. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/windows-powershell/starting-windows-powershell  [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/windows-powershell/starting-windows-powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/windows-powershell/starting-windows-powershell)  OSX: Click the Launchpad icon in the Dock, type Terminal in the search field, then click Terminal. or In the Finder , open the /Applications/Utilities folder, then double-click Terminal. https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/open-or-quit-terminal-apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac  [https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/open-or-quit-terminal-apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/open-or-quit-terminal-apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac)  Linux: Due to the ubiquity of user interfaces, the most likely way to get a command prompt is to use a virtual terminal from ctl-alt-F4 or similar. To return to your graphical display, it’s usually ctl-alt-F7 or occasionally ctl-alt-F1. If neither of these work, cycle through all the ctl-alt-F# keys. One of them is bound to have your X session.  Next, you will type the following at this command prompt:  ssh yourusername@theServerToWhichYouAreConnecting e.g. ssh jawzjaguar@in-info-web4.informatics.iupui.edu  You will see a response similar or identical to:  The authenticity of host ‘in-info-web4.informatics.iupui.edu (134.68.246.118)’ can’t be established. ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:i+GIv+KvV1xr56iWkAmONNT5L7ybmZzzfTP4BauWdUo. Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?  Type “yes” to continue, then it will ask for your IU passphrase.  Once entered, you will have a command prompt on the server which will look like this: jawzjaguar@in-info-web4:~$ "

    "body": "  ## Dr. Stephen Voida Receives Google Faculty Research Award for Wearable Display Ecologies Project  September 10, 2014  Dr. Stephen Voida, assistant professor of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, recently received the prestigious Google Faculty Research Award.      The Google Faculty Research Award is accompanied by a $55,673 grant that will support the study “Glanceable, Peripheral, Haptic, and Audible Displays: Supporting Wearable Display Ecologies for Personal Informatics.”  This study will help to expand scientists’ and designers’ understanding of how users currently manage information across multiple devices and test a new infrastructure for coordinating information displays across a wide variety of computing devices, including smartphones, tablets, augmented reality systems like Google Glass, and wearable computing devices like the Apple Watch, FitBit, Samsung Galaxy Gear, and the Moto 360 smartwatch.  “Today people have multiple devices that they use to communicate, work, and organize their lives —a smartphone, tablet, watch, audio player—and the list continues to grow,” says Dr. Voida.  “It can be overwhelming trying to keep everything updated and in sync.  Our research aims to enable a person’s devices to communicate with one another to display alerts and notifications on the right device and at the right time. We envision that this research will have a significant impact on the daily lives of people who use multiple devices by helping to reduce the amount of work that managing these devices often requires…and the potential annoyance of having to deal with a constant stream of notifications.”  Google Research Awards mission: Organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.  As part of that vision, the Google Research Awards program aims to identify and support world-class, full-time faculty pursuing research in areas of mutual interest.  This round, Google received 722 proposals from 44 countries. After expert reviews, 110 projects were selected for funding, with an acceptance rate of 15%.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Informatics alumnus credits success to taking risks, community, and networking  September 14, 2022  IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI alumnus Boris Golubov says one thing that really drew him in was the connection between people and technology. He majored In Informatics and graduated in 2012, going to work for Eli Lilly and Co. shortly thereafter.  [Informatics](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/undergraduate/informatics/)  “Informatics sits between those two groups and really bring them together to achieve one goal.  That really excited me as I love bringing people together,” he says. “I think the program really prepares you well with many options to begin your career.  Whether you want to be more technical and work within a database or be a project manager and understand technology, Informatics opens many of those avenues.”  When Golubov was trying to decide a major, he was looking for something that could leverage technology with his people and communication skills.  When he started the program, one thing that kept drawing him further and further into it was the vast variety of classes that he was getting exposure into.  One would be a coding class, next semester it would be project management and the semester after that would be leadership.  He says it really allowed him to figure out what he liked and the flexibility of the program let him tailor his classes to have a more focused plan into the classes where he wanted to dive deeper.  One thing that really stood out to him about the program was the faculty.  “They really care about the students and want them succeed.  I get that sounds a bit cliché but I continue to have strong relationships with a number of people that helped me get through the program.  As an example, I leveraged Brian Benedict in career services who was instrumental in helping me with internships and now we chat regularly about work, IUPUI and most importantly life,” Golubov says.  Golubov’s current title is Associate Director at Eli Lilly.  Currently, he is living in Cork Ireland working on an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Implementation.  It is a really exciting role and he loves the global team that is part of all of that, he says.   ### Success in life begins with community…  When Golubov thinks about his career plan, he first reflects on his past.  “A thirty-three-thousand-dollar loan to open a business was a risk my parents were willing to take so that my brother and I could have a better future. My parents are no strangers when it comes to taking risks for the family. You see, our home was in Yugoslavia, which has since dissolved into many different countries. My time in ex-Yugoslavia was cut short due to a civil war that began in ‘91. Without a lot of options and no end to the war in sight, my parents packed up our family in the middle of the night and fled the war-ravaged country in ’95. By pure chance, we ended up in Germany. To this day, my parents are not sure how that happened but were thrilled that it did. My brother and I were able to have a somewhat normal childhood. We went to school, learned a second language, and played outside without the worry of stray bullets or tanks shooting near our play area,” Golubov recalls.  After two years, his parents received some difficult news. Germany ended the war visa program, and his parents again had a difficult decision to make. Germany offered two choices: go back to Yugoslavia or apply to the US Refugee Program with the possibility to make America their new home. Two years of peace was a small taste of what his parents dreamed of having for a lifetime. They decided to take a risk and apply. After a grueling eight-hour interview and multiple health screenings, they were on our way to America. In ’97, they landed in Indianapolis and were transported to their apartment in Speedway, Indiana.  “It was time for my family to start over again, learn a new language, restart school, and find another play area. Mom and Dad worked at McDonald’s, and my dad found a second job pushing carts in the evening at Meijer. Eventually, my parents saved enough money and, combined with a thirty-three-thousand-dollar bank loan, opened Mediterranean Pizza in Brownsburg, Indiana,” Golubov says. “When I look back at everything that my parents did to get me into the position I am in today, I don’t think about the future so much but rather, how can I help those in the community as we had help every step of our way.  I think you do those things first, and the rest of your career will fall into place.”   ### …and continues with networking  Golubov says he has a lot of learnings but the one that really sticks out to him is build your network even inside of work.  You will not always be a decision-maker but you can use your network to help influence a decision.  His advice to current students is: Network, Network, Network! Wherever you want to work, whether its Eli Lilly or any other company, you have to network.  “I love this quote: your network is your net worth.  I could not agree more with that quote.  Leverage tools like LinkedIn, after class activities, volunteer, and treat everyone with kindness and grace as you never know who might be on the other side of an interview in the future. The other thing is strive to do your best on whatever you are working on at school or at work.  “Don’t half (do) things, but do them all to your fullest, you never know who is watching!  “Keep networking and never shy away from introducing yourself.  Stay confident and keep pushing the envelope,  If we were able to overcome some adversity, every single one of you can too!”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## WISE Indiana internship was a smart choice for MLIS student Michelle Quirke  June 22, 2022  ( Pictured above left to right, Amy Blevins, Michelle Quirke, Aaron Zych. Photo provided by Michelle Quirke )  When grad student Michelle Quirke was looking for an Master in Library and Information Science (MLIS) program two requirements were at the top of her list: a campus with a medical library and a degree that included information science in addition to library science. The MLIS program at the IU School of Informatics and Computing (SoIC) at IUPUI checked all the boxes.  [Master in Library and Information Science](https://luddy.iupui.edu/lis/master-library-science/)  “The MLIS program offered me the chance to complete an internship in medical librarianship while continuing to work. This gave me skills to enhance performance in my current position in areas such as NIH Data Management Plans and working with researchers to maintain Public Access Compliance on publications supported by NIH. But it also provided the academic background to round out my training and build a network of mentors and professional resources to continue growing in my librarian career,” Quirke said.  During spring 2022, Quirke was a graduate library assistant for WISE Indiana . In her role, she conducted comprehensive searches of scientific literature and prepared annotated bibliographies to support the Indiana Family and Social Science Administration’s (FSSA) vision of evidence-informed health policy decision-making. She says she improved her proficiency evaluating and identifying evidence-based research, analyzing scientific literature, and writing annotations and summary reports for stakeholders. “ Kym Kramer has been a constant support throughout my program. She guided me in my foundation courses and worked with me to maximize my internship experience. I am eternally grateful for my advisor Brandon Pieczko, Digital and Special Collections Librarian, with Ruth Lilly Medical Library. He referred me for the internship and introduced me to Amy Blevins who served as my internship mentor. Without his encouragement, I would not have found the internship or felt confident to apply,” Quirke said.  [WISE Indiana](https://indianactsi.org/community/monon-collaborative/wise-indiana/)  [Kym Kramer](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/kym-kramer/)  Amy Blevins and Aaron Zych were Quirke’s mentors at WISE. Zych explained that many of the projects that WISE Indiana engages in with Indiana FSSA have real life implications in policy decision-making. “For students, it’s important for them to have exposure to a real working environment, as well as for the internship work to have value. We see true merit in engaging students in this work because of the unique and fresh perspective they bring to the table, and the opportunity for them to see their work impact the lives of Hoosiers,” he said.  Blevins said, “Throughout my career, I have benefited from great mentors and try to give back by serving as a mentor when possible. Participating in Michelle’s internship through SoIC has been a great opportunity to work with an enthusiastic student with an interest in health sciences librarianship. I have enjoyed working with Michelle and showing her the value that members of our profession bring to programs like WISE Indiana.”  “My internship introduced me to the value of being part of an inter-professional team. Seeing how the team brought their strengths to review policies and support evidence-informed health policy decisions for Indiana was a new experience. It was highly rewarding knowing that each person worked together to build a healthy community,” Quirke said. “I highly encourage an internship as part of career training. If I had to sum up how I am different than when I started, it is my professional identity. I thought this internship would be literature searches, annotated bibliographies, and working on evidence-based research. But what I discovered is an internship isn’t just about the ‘work’ but about the personal development. If it works in your academic plan, go for it! It will change your career and introduce you to amazing people with similar interests.”  Quirke currently is employed as a Research Operations Manager in the Indiana Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center at the IU School of Medicine. She works with a variety of researchers and National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded programs and utilizes the Ruth Lilly Medical Library and medical librarians when she needs assistance. She believes these interactions demonstrate how she will continue to find value with her MLIS degree throughout her career by applying what she has learned to improve her proficiency with NIH policies, utilize resources to navigate complex interconnected systems, and enhance her health sciences data management skills. After graduation, she plans to continue working in either a medical or health sciences librarian role and hopes to continue supporting NIH researchers and managing research data focused on improving quality of life.  She is scheduled to graduate in December 2022.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

The event is a one-day competition for high school students, who are awarded prizes for designing and building a mobile app based on assigned specifications.    This year’s challenge was based on the concept “Chindogu”—the conscious effort to make something that works but has no worth. The teams spent approximately eight hours brainstorming a concept, executing the app, and uploading the app to an android phone.  Each team had two to three members with expertise in coding and design, and an adult mentor. Members demonstrated their creativity, team building, and app-development skills during the high-energy event, which was hosted by the Department of Human-Centered Computing.  Judges from area tech companies, Rocket Build and Allegion, evaluated the resulting apps for completeness, creativity, and user experience.  Top finishers this year were MechaDuck—Jacob Lovrinic and Taylor Horne, first place—representing Center Grove High School. The Brogrammers—Vamshi Balanaga, Justin Spoon, and Elijah Peters, from Columbus North High School, took second place. Cookie Dough—Yijiang Zhao, Anay Gangal, and Adhil Akbar, also from Columbus North, took third place. All winning teams were awarded a cash prize, scholarship and summer research funds at the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, and software titles donated by Pearson. Center Grove High School will also receive the Mobile App Challenge perpetual trophy to display for a year, which will be engraved with the team and school names.  Travis Faas, lecturer in the Media Arts and Science program, coordinated this year’s competition, along with High School Recruiter Christopher Ha. “It’s hard to find something more human than our personal apps on our phones, making them a perfect starting point for students who are considering work in human-centered computing. This competition is just one way to expose students to the exciting possibilities inherent in the field,” said Faas.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## IUPUI’s Women in Technology makes debut with First Annual Networking and Career Day featuring IU’s First Lady, Laurie McRobbie  April 4, 2011  Female students pursuing or considering high-tech careers have a new resource on the IUPUI campus.  Students have partnered with the School of Informatics and Computing to organize Women in Technology (WIT), an organization dedicated to empowering, inspiring and developing female leaders in computing and technology. And they are introducing themselves to the IUPUI community on April 28th with the First Annual Women in Technology Networking and Career Day at the IUPUI Campus Center. This free event, scheduled from 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m., features local employers, roundtable discussions and IU’s First Lady, Laurie McRobbie, as keynote speaker.  WIT and the April 28th event are supported in part by an IUPUI Campus Center Funding Grant and the National Center for Women in Information Technology (NCWIT), which recently awarded the group a grant to help develop their IUPUI presence. According to NCWIT, groups encouraging women in technology are much-needed. Women occupy more than half of all professional positions in the U.S., but only one-fourth of all computing-related occupations. And women make up only 11 percent of corporate officers at Fortune 500 technology companies. Furthermore, women earned 18 percent of all computing-related degrees as recently as 2009 – a significant drop from 1985 when women earned 37 percent of all such degrees.  WIT hopes to significantly build its membership across all undergraduate and graduate programs on campus, including informatics, computer science, engineering and more. Benefits it plans to offer its members include mentoring, networking opportunities and research resources, as well as community outreach projects. It also plans to continue building strong, supportive relationships with local employers and female IT leaders like Laurie McRobbie.  McRobbie worked as a technologist in higher education for more than 25 years and holds an adjunct faculty appointment in the IU School of Informatics and Computing and Computing in Bloomington, where she helped found and currently chairs the Advisory Committee for an IT Clinic that provides service-learning opportunities for Informatics and Computing students with south central Indiana nonprofits. She is the former executive director of Internet2, a not-for-profit advanced networking consortium comprising more than 200 U.S. universities in cooperation with corporations, government agencies, research labs and other entities. She works with others within IU and statewide to emphasize the importance of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education for Indiana’s—and the nation’s—future.

    "body": "  ## New, real-time COVID-19 diagnostic tests in development by IU research collaboration  March 16, 2020  INDIANAPOLIS — Indiana University researchers from the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI and the School of Medicine, in collaboration with Indiana University Health, are developing new diagnostic tests that combine speed and sensitivity for rapid detection of the viral strain.  IU and IU Health researchers are working on a test that can eventually be employed for faster diagnosis of health care workers and others who are on the front lines and exposed to COVID-19 patients.  These tests can eventually be employed for faster diagnosis of health care workers and others who are on the front lines and exposed to COVID-19 patients.  Benchtop and palm-held sequencing-based approaches being developed by IU principal investigator Sarath Janga and colleagues provide solutions for real-time detection of viral infections in clinical samples and further means to control the outbreaks.  “The issue with current accepted approaches for COVID-19 tests is that, while effective at detection, they are slow, with results taking up to a day or longer. We are testing our benchtop sequencing approach, which can potentially be done in two to three hours or even less,” Janga said.  An additional advantage of this novel approach is that testing may be performed at point-of-care in the clinic, rather than transferring samples to the lab, further reducing time and the risk of more infections.  Given these challenges, the team hopes to leverage the findings from these new rapid tests to generate quantitative or semi-quantitative data that can be used to identify the COVID-19 strains prevalent in Indiana and reconstruct the development and evolution of the virus to inform surveillance, public health strategy, and potential vaccine design going forward.  Janga’s lab is also supporting current ongoing COVID-19 testing by providing personnel and necessary reagents to the clinical pathology lab at IU Health.  “Viral outbreaks such as COVID-19 need real-time detection of the status of infection in patients to control the spread,” Janga said. “Since there are currently no specific treatments for coronavirus infections, and strains of these RNA viruses evolve rapidly, it is crucial to develop novel techniques that can provide rapid diagnostics and therapeutic intervention.”  Like coronavirus, several viral strains are pathogenic in nature, difficult to detect and easy to transmit, leading to the emergence of pandemics. In the case of an outbreak, it is important to have a method to detect the virus as quickly and accurately as possible in order to prevent its transmission and efficiently treat infected patients.  Currently, most clinical diagnostic tests for viruses depend on either detecting viral antigens or on PCR amplification of viral nucleic acids. These two approaches offer trade-offs and benefits. Antigen tests are typically rapid but have low sensitivity, while PCR is more time-consuming and more sensitive.  Janga and his team are employing a commercially available Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing platform that generates full-length DNA or direct RNA virus sequences from clinical samples.  Janga, an associate professor in bioinformatics and data science in the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, and visiting research associate Quoseena Mir, from the Department of Biohealth Informatics in the School of Informatics and Computing, are collaborating with Ryan Relich, head of the IU Health Clinical Pathology Laboratory and assistant professor of clinical pathology and laboratory medicine at IU School of Medicine, and Dr. Raj Vuppalanchi, director of the clinical hepatology division in the IU School of Medicine’s Department of Medicine.

Excerpt:  Robots of earlier \"Terminator\" movies, such as the famous model played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, walked with the easy confidence of programmed beings. Their apparent inhumanity fed the thrill of terror felt by both human characters and movie audiences.  [thrill of terror](http://www.livescience.com/technology/090519-robot-fear-countdown.html)  What the new \"Terminator Salvation\" suggests is that one of the earliest human-looking terminators had something of an identity crisis, and even bore the human name \"Marcus Wright.\" That robotic delusion lasts until Wright gets captured with a horrific wound that exposes his true self.  \"In the instant Marcus stares down at his mechanical torso, his sense of personal and human identity has been knocked out from under him, and that’s devastating,\" said Karl MacDorman, a robotics researcher at Indiana University.

The award is the highest recognition for an undergraduate researcher on the IUPUI campus.  Also honored with a 2017 IUPUI Top 100 Student award, Jacobs has been working with Media Arts and Science faculty member Zebulun Wood of the School of Informatics and Computing and Dr. Travis Bellicchi of the IU School of Dentistry for two years on the creation of 3-D maxillofacial prosthetics, using a process now known as the Shirley Technique.  [Zebulun Wood](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/zeb-wood/)  The project originated when Bellicchi approached Wood about his patient, Shirley Anderson, a cancer survivor who needed a new prosthetic mandible. Too large and cumbersome to produce using traditional materials and methods, the mandible was the first prosthetic of its size created at a university via digital scanning and 3-D sculpture and printing technology. Jacobs has been integral to creating and refining the 3-D prosthetic modeling and sculpting technique.  Watch a video about the Shirley Technique.  [Watch a video about the Shirley Technique.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quNhCGzjf3c)  “Shirley Anderson and the subsequent patients that were cared for using the same technique—around 20 in total—are my greatest accomplishment to date,” Jacobs said.  Jacobs has presented the research results at several symposia and conferences and is a co-applicant for a patent on the process. He has been seeking support for expanding the service locally and internationally and has co-founded a business, Plasthetics, devoted to medical scanning and prosthesis design.  Jacobs is a member of the IUPUI Honors Program, is a regular on the Dean’s List, and has served as chapter president of IUPUI SIGGRAPH and as a volunteer student mentor. He is also employed as a service engineer for Online Resources, Inc., a reverse engineering and metrology company that serves manufacturing, aerospace, racing, automotive, and other industries.  After graduation, Jacobs plans to study engineering or business in graduate school. “Cade has been a true pleasure to work with. He is an outstanding example of what a student can accomplish with grit, focus, vision, and unrelenting positive attitude towards solving wicked problems with his skill sets,” said Wood. “He is by far the most independent and resourceful student I have ever had the pleasure of mentoring. Cade’s success is a proud moment for all of us at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

Colloquia provide IUPUI students, faculty and staff the opportunity to hear from leading researchers in the dynamic fields of informatics, media arts, and the health and life sciences. Presentations begin January 22, 2010 with speaker Eli Blevis, Ph.D., and his lecture titled, “ Collaborative competitive challenge-based studio learning (C3SL) in the context of HCI and HCC .”  Blevis is an Associate Professor of Informatics in the Human-Computer Interaction Design program at the Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing and Computing in Bloomington. Blevis has created a novel pedagogical paradigm for human-computer interaction (HCI) and human-centered computing (HCC) called collaborative competitive challenge-based studio learning (C3SL). This new paradigm presents learners with design research and concept challenges based on social issues. These social issues manifest as individual, collaborative and competitive activities involving public presentation and critique. This paradigm hopes to foster greater human-centrism, social values and ethics in the research and practice of HCC and HCI.  Lectures will be held from 10:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. in room 252 of the Informatics and Communications Technology Complex (IT) located at 535 West Michigan Street in Indianapolis, unless otherwise noted.

    "body": "  ## Wilma Gibbs Moore Graduate Endowed Scholarship Highlight  August 11, 2021  The Wilma Gibbs Moore Graduate Endowed Scholarship, which was established in 2018 to assist Library and Information Science (LIS) students who are underrepresented in the field, celebrated an exciting milestone this year. Less than three years after its establishment, it has reached endowment levels, meaning it will generate income that will fund the scholarship in perpetuity. This is largely due to the efforts of LIS faculty, particularly LIS Department Chair Andrea Copeland . We spoke with Dr. Copeland about the origins of this scholarship, Wilma Moore’s connection to the LIS program, and importance of representation and diversity in the field of Library and Information Sciences.  [Andrea Copeland](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/andrea-copeland/)  “I got to know Wilma through working with her on the Bethel archive project ,” Dr. Copeland remembers, referring to the SoIC initiative funded by Indiana University’s New Frontiers of Creativity and Scholarship award, which helped save a historic trove of archival documents and objects from the Bethel AME Church, Indianapolis’ oldest African-American church. Wilma Moore was an IU-Bloomington graduate who dedicated her life to contributing to and archiving the record of African-Americans to Indiana history, both as an employee of IU Libraries, Indiana Public Library, and the Indiana Historical Society, and as editor of Black History News & Note, and contributing editor of Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History. She received the Award of Merit from the American Association for State and Local History and the Eli Lilly Lifetime Achievement Award for her contributions in the field of history.  [Bethel archive project](https://luddy.iupui.edu/news/story/grant-preserving-church-heritage)  “[Wilma] was the archivist that handled the donation and the processing of the archive at the Indiana Historical Society.” Dr. Copeland says. “At this close of this project, she passed. Kisha Tandy at the State Museum and a LIS alum was also working on this project. She was a close mentee of Wilma’s. We wanted to do something to memorialize her contribution to the field. Then, Nichelle Hayes, another alum and director at the Center for Black Literature and Culture at the Indianapolis Public Library, and Stanley Warren, historian, longtime collaborator of Wilma’s and emeritus professor from DePauw University, joined our efforts. Wilma’s daughters, Johari Miller-Wilson, M.D. and Jamila Miller Mamuya, were financially instrumental in getting the scholarship to the endowment level.”  The Wilma Gibbs Moore Graduate Endowed Scholarship is open to any student whose ethnicity is underrepresented in the library and archives professions, and has been assisting student since its inception. “We’ve admitted one Moore scholar each academic year since AY 2018-2019,” says Dr. Copeland. “[Wilma] Indirectly mentored several LIS students through the years, as well as the first two Moore Scholars, Olivia MacIsaac and Lyndsey Blair .”  [Olivia MacIsaac](https://luddy.iupui.edu/news/story/wilma-gibbs-moore-scholar)  [Lyndsey Blair](https://luddy.iupui.edu/news/story/lyndsey-blair-moore-scholar)  Dr. Copeland believes scholarships, like the Moore Scholarship, that benefit underrepresented minorities are essential for the future of the library and archives professions. “The library and archive professions are approximately 85% white. The lack of diversity has a detrimental impact on all aspects of the field.” Dr. Copeland states. “I’ll name a few—as a result of the majority race developing collections, our collections are not as inclusive as they should be. Collections have been developed in favor of those with power and resources. Part of Wilma’s legacy is that she broke racial barriers in archives and in doing so practically single handedly gathered and made accessible a part of the state’s heritage that would not otherwise have been made accessible. Further, it is important that the individuals that work in libraries reflect the community they serve.  We want librarians and libraries to integrate into the fabric of a community’s life not stand outside or next to it or worse yet above it. Given the history of race in this country, it is naive to think this type of integration can happen if community members cannot see their lived experiences in the design of library services, resources, and personnel.”  Those who wish to donate to the Wilma Gibbs Moore scholarship may contact Cory Aiello at caiello@iupui.edu with any questions.

    "body": "  ## Senior Sheila Hendricks takes the human side of HIM into the boxing ring  January 17, 2022  ( photo courtesy of Sheila Hendricks )  When Health Information Management (HIM) student Sheila Hendricks entered the School of Informatics and Computing degree program in 2015, she was looking for a career segue that would allow her to eventually work from home.  She was employed full-time in the orthodontics field after prior employment in radiology and insurance when her husband began experiencing some neurological issues.  [Health Information Management](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/undergraduate/him/)  “When I looked at the online degree options, I saw Health Information Management and it seemed a logical fit. I enjoy what I do and wanted to stay within the healthcare field. I saw the HIM degree as a way to continue within the field I enjoyed while furthering my knowledge. I thought my years of experience combined with the HIM degree and the Registered Health Information Administrator (RHIA) certification would be what I needed to eventually work from home within the healthcare field,” Hendricks says.  After Hendricks’ husband was diagnosed with early onset Parkinson’s Disease (PD), two of the specialists treating him recommended Rock Steady Boxing (RSB) as part of his therapy. The non-contact boxing program was started in 2006 by former Marion County prosecutor Scott Newman and retired World Champion boxer Kristy Rose Follmar and was designed specifically for people with PD.  [Rock Steady Boxing](https://www.rocksteadyboxing.org/)  Hendricks and her husband began classes on November 28, 2015, with her as his care partner or “cornerman.” After a year, they both went through volunteer orientation to learn how to support other boxers through classes and workouts or help with equipment. Six months later, they went through the RSB coaches program so they could also create the various PD boxing classes. In addition, they both helped with presentations about PD to college student groups as well as at a symposium.  Hendricks says she sees a clear connection between RSB and her HIM major. RSB maintains records and must abide by privacy safeguards similar to HIPAA regulations and keep that data secure. The gym has participated in longitudinal research studies and some of the boxers have been part of clinical trials. Coaches also need to understand the treatments boxers receive and how they can affect performance.  “From a HIM standpoint, being able to see boxers participate in research projects to advance the treatment options of PD is invaluable as I get to see the research from the medical standpoint of data but also from the boxer’s standpoint. These experiences with the boxers have shown me the human side of research which I may not have seen otherwise,” Hendricks says.  Hendricks also points to the benefit of the anatomy class she took in preparing her for her ACE Fitness personal trainer exam. And she was able to help the gym manager create a spreadsheet to track positivity rates at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Her HIM courses allowed her to understand the numbers and how best to present them. Another direct benefit to Hendricks was that the HIM classes taught her the importance of patients understanding their own care and of using data to improve patient outcomes. She sees firsthand how the boxers share knowledge with each other that helps them understand treatment options and have a better quality of life.  Her advice to other HIM students is to be open to all possibilities. “If someone would have told me I would be a certified personal trainer and a boxing coach, I would have thought they lost their mind. However, being a part of the RSB gym has given me experiences beyond words. Meeting all of the amazing people has been life changing. The members of the RSB gym are a large family and I cannot image how different my life would be without them. As weird as it sounds, my husband and I are grateful for his PD diagnosis because without it, we would never have met some of the most interesting, amazing people whom we consider family.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

This was the premise of the winning concept at the 2021 Indy Civic Hackathon. The challenge to participants this year was to brainstorm and research possible solutions to strengthening neighborhoods, using data and technology.  The School of Informatics and Computing (SoIC) at IUPUI team of Akash Rode, Sarah Nikkhah, and Hinal Kiri (pictured left to right), all graduate students in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) program , took first place with a mobile application concept for addressing food insecurity, which they named Food Friend Indiana.  [Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) program](https://luddy.iupui.edu/hcc/graduate/hci/masters/)  The team researched the problem thoroughly, finding that around 1 million people in Indiana are food insecure. The USDA defines that term as a “lack of consistent access to enough food for an active, healthy life.” In Marion County alone, 3% of residents have an unmet need for food; half of those are families with children.   ### Accessing a treasure trove of data  The Indy Civic Hack grew from an idea in 2014, spearheaded by Brian Norris and Matt Kirby, and supported by volunteers representing local government agencies, non-profits, for-profits, and community groups, to make more government data sets accessible to the public. It is now an annual event, open to the community, that encourages use of the vast amount of data available in response to societal challenges.  [Indy Civic Hack](http://indycivichack.org)  As Scott Moshier, VP Data Solutions at Metamor Systems and volunteer with the Indy Civic Hack, explained, “The genesis of this was to show the government—both city and state governments here in Indiana—two different things. One is the tech community could come out and try to help them with the problems that they had. Secondly, if the government provided machine-readable data that applications could actually use…then there could be a bunch of different apps that could be created, whether they be web apps or mobile apps or what have you….that could really help the community in general.  “Over the years we’ve expanded that model because what we’ve seen is both the city of Indianapolis and the state of Indiana have created open data portals and they’ve populated those with really interesting and valuable data,” Moshier said. Over the last several years the group has broadened their efforts to more of a community program, asking how data can be used to better the community overall. “It’s been an interesting collaboration between governments, for-profit companies as well as not-for-profits, and community groups. The overall focus is inclusive growth: the idea of how can we include everybody, all citizens, in the growth of Indianapolis?”  Rode, Kiri, and Nikkhah conducted a focus group with several local organizations, including Indy Hunger Network, Gleaners Food Bank of Indiana, Center for Victim and Human Rights, and the Immigrant Welcome Center, and interviewed the Foodbank of Northern Indiana. They also performed a literature review and found there was a stigma around locating and using food-related resources. In the process, the team discovered another challenge: While non-profit organizations and volunteers play a substantial role in addressing food insecurity, two out of three decreased or stopped volunteer activities during the covid pandemic.  The Food Friends Indiana app aims to solve problems for all three types of users: organizations, volunteers, and clients.   ### Putting HCI skills to work for good  “This hackathon brought to our attention the smallest things we could take for granted—like availability of food, ability to speak a language and to be understood. We realized the depth of the food insecurity problem in Indianapolis, and how an inclusive volunteering environment can benefit the community,” said Kiri.  Nikkhah added, “Being able to contribute and give back to the community through research and design skills was the most important highlight of attending the Indy Civic Hackathon.”  Taking that learning to find a real-world solution that benefits the whole community, was a fortuitous experience.  — Hinal Kiri  All three students credited coursework at the School of Informatics and Computing, as well as mentoring by HCI Professor of Practice Lou Lenzi , for their success. “It was a team-effort and every team member had a role to play. Participating in several team-based projects while pursuing courses at SoIC prepared us for this Hackathon,” Rode said. The HCI program teaches a human-centered approach to design that puts user needs first, as well as soft skills like presentation. Rode says the team intends to stay in touch with the organizations working to eradicate food insecurity issues and continue to learn how to best help them.  [Lou Lenzi](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/lou-lenzi/)  After graduating with her PhD, Nikkhah wants to pursue a career as a user experience (UX) researcher. On completion of the master’s program, Rode hopes to work as a product designer and Kiri is inclined toward music UXD but is still exploring her options.   ### More about Food Friend Indiana mobile app  To develop the app concept, the team first created a client persona and developed a client journey map, showing the various steps from identifying a need to locating and picking up food to eat. They also created journey maps for the food distribution organization and for a potential volunteer. The resulting app connects a food insecure person to an organization and helps the organization function more efficiently with more volunteers and retention of those volunteers, as well as publicizing their work. The team also researched feasibility and cost for developing and maintaining the app.  Using the app, organizations can create a dashboard to monitor their activities; manage events; and find, register and communicate with volunteers. Volunteers can search and explore opportunities to help; make donations; register for events; and follow organizations. Clients can search for specific services, like meals, groceries, and WIC and SNAP retailers, based on location, distance, and open hours; review event details; and find healthy meal recipes. They can even be connected with specific volunteers if there is a language barrier.  Watch the team’s presentation.

    "body": "  ## Two MAS alumni to premiere documentary at the Tribeca Film Fest  April 2, 2018  Sam Mirpoorian and Brenton Oechsle, both graduates of the Media Arts and Science (MAS) undergraduate program in video and sound production at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, will help premiere the documentary film, Destination Park , at the Tribeca Film Festival beginning April 18 in New York City. Mirpoorian is editor and co-producer, while Oechsle is director of photography and co-producer.  [program in video and sound production](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/undergraduate/media-arts/video-sound/)  [Tribeca Film Festival](https://www.tribecafilm.com/)  Mirpoorian, who graduated in 2017 and is on hiatus from the school’s MAS master’s program, and Oechsle, who graduated in 2013, met at a Heartland Film Festival event. Both became involved in the project via the Indianapolis film community and connections with the director, Andrew Cohn, who filmed Night School in Indianapolis in 2014.  Destination Park is a short film about a group of truck drivers that confide their fears and anxieties to a chaplin at a truck stop confessional in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The film’s name is taken from the specific type of truck stop. A destination truck stop is where truckers wait—sometimes for an indeterminate amount of time—until they find out where they will be dispatched next.  “In fall 2016, Andrew Cohn approached me about the concept of shooting a short documentary on mobile chapels,” says Oechsle. “We both felt that with the political climate since the election this would be a pertinent subject to focus on.” The majority of the trucking population are older, white, conservative males and Cohn and Oechsle felt that a deep dive into their way of life and psyches would serve a greater purpose, beyond the film.  Oechsle and Cohn visited the stop twice, for several days each time, filming conversations in the chapel or B-roll in the parking lot outside. “Altogether this was much different than the documentary and narrative work I usually do, which is much more structured. We had to be constantly on our toes and consistently aware of what was happening around us,” Oechsle says. “That’s the kind of stuff I really enjoy though—where you just capture what’s around you.”  Mirpoorian subsequently learned that the film was sitting, waiting to be edited, and got in touch with Cohn. “It was a fantastic experience. I learned so many new tricks and techniques of storytelling and how to make a film on such a unique story,” says Mirpoorian. “Andrew has a background in this style of documentary filmmaking, telling the story for the voiceless. He’s a fantastic filmmaker and I’ve learned so much through working with him.”  The Tribeca Film Festival is one of the most prominent in the world and attracts over 400,000 film enthusiasts. Created in response to the September 11 tragedies, it is considered to be on par with Cannes and Sundance. “To have this film world premiere is just a feeling like no other. I am blessed and fortunate to have played a role,” says Mirpoorian.  Oechsle and Mirpoorian credit many of their professors, in particular C. Thomas Lewis , Zebulun Wood , and Rodney Smith , for their educational grounding in the profession. The MAS program gave them the freedom to explore creativity and to pursue whatever project they sought out. Mirpoorian adds that truly the best way to hone filmmaking skill sets is by just literally ‘doing’.  [C.

    "body": "  ## Virtual film production provides real-world skills for School of Informatics and Computing students  May 4, 2021  (original story by Kirk Johannesen, published May 4, 2021)  Hollywood could be a future stop for some IUPUI students who learned skills and technology that have become increasingly important in the filmmaking industry after they teamed up on a unique School of Informatics and Computing project.  A team of five students in Zebulun Wood’s N420 Multimedia Production Management class used virtual production, a technique popularized by “The Mandalorian,” to create a commercial for the Media Arts and Science program.  “These skills gave the students an early sneak peek at trends in the filmmaking industry,” Wood said.  Virtual production uses on-set cameras and actors but then layers digital backgrounds that are created from video-game engines, Wood said. It’s a way to capture the performances of actors while controlling the physical location.  “This method of filmmaking has been popularized during the COVID-19 pandemic because there is less need for the entire team of filmmakers to travel to multiple locations around the world,” Wood said.  The students — Kayleigh Jones, Joel Holland, Isaac Johnston, Brandon Winkler and Christian Cochran — pooled their skill sets from multiple specializations in film, 3D and game design to combine cameras and camera movement from the real world with the same movements happening in the virtual world, Wood said.  This type of project was a first for any team in his class, Wood added, and the challenge for the students was to use the school’s existing technology for the new method of filmmaking.  Holland is a senior in the Media Arts and Science program who is focusing on game design and development. He said he first learned about film and visual effects in high school, and he knew that game engines had been used for real-time animation and rendering. He said he’d been curious about the technology but never thought he’d have the opportunity to see it up close.  “So, when I saw that the school believed it had the equipment to make it happen, I couldn’t sign up fast enough,” Holland said.  Winkler, a senior in Media Arts and Science, said that part of the team spent several weeks researching the hardware and software needed. The team used Unreal Engine for the game engine. Some students produced a text script, and one created a visual script using the game engine.  For camera expertise in form of directors of cinematography, professor Thomas Lewis recommended undergraduate students Cory Shearer and Alex Gao, who volunteered for the project, Wood said. They worked with the team to ensure a smooth shoot, tested camera light in real and digital worlds, and checked the final image quality.  Unreal Engine allowed the team to build its virtual worlds. Production also involved removing the greenscreen and adding a special C-shaped screen to wrap around the actors in the environment they were acting in. With the help of virtual reality, the team could move a real-life camera and have the in-game camera move synchronously, Winkler said.  For the final product, the students placed an actor on stage to give the illusion of being in both a futuristic city and in a medieval town with a fire-breathing dragon.  “The students met and exceeded all expectations, completed the project earlier than anticipated and have left our program in a very good position to continue the development of these skills within our coursework and curriculum offerings,” Wood said.  Winkler said that the technical and communication skills he learned on the project are crucial to his career as a game developer and project manager.  Cochran, a senior who is specializing in game development, said the project taught him how to work with virtual cameras and improve his video editing. It also took him out of his comfort zone and has given him a look at what he can do in the future.  Jones, a junior who is focusing on game design and development and digital storytelling, said she learned a lot from the project and in her role as project manager and writer because the class provided an experience close to one in the real-life workforce.  “The project taught me a lot about filmmaking and innovative technology entering the workforce,” Jones said. “It also taught me a lot about how to work with the client and adjust your plan to the new specifications they can spring on you. I can easily use these skills in my future career.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Revamped master’s level MAS program prepares grads for workforce  January 8, 2019  Over a year ago, Media Arts and Science (MAS) faculty embarked on a mission to redesign their outdated master’s degree program. Their goal: create a pathway to industry that focused on emergent technology and developed skills from concept to finished project that would better prepare students for their careers.  Associate Professor Joseph Defazio, with support from Davide Bolchini, chair of the Department of Human-Centered Computing (HCC), and input from the HCC Advisory Board, led the effort to redesign the program, course by course, after extensive survey analysis of industry professionals. Christy Gormal, COO and VP of Matchbook Creative, an HCC board member and alumna of the MAS graduate program, developed and taught one of the initial core courses,  NEWM-N 501 Foundations of Digital Production.  Defazio says that things change so quickly in this field, and with about half of the students already working, it was important to both stay abreast of new developments and build on a solid foundation.  The MAS graduate program has been expanded from 30 to 36 credit hours to match other graduate programs, and now includes 24 core requirements, a choice of 2 electives that align with objectives, and either a final project or thesis.  Gormal says it became clear during conversations with faculty and program chairs that talent was there, but students were challenged with a lack of understanding about the operational side of a business. “They have never been tasked with planning the project, discovering where certain project decisions should or should not be made, or how to create a timeline and budget and how that can impact that outcome. (In this program) they learn about roles and responsibilities and what it takes to be profitable, all while managing the successful outcome of the actual project.”  She says that once students understand business objectives, their moves and contributions become intentional, and that when the company is more successful the employees can also reap those benefits.  Students in Gormal’s class partnered with industry to work on real-life projects and apply what they learned. Two of them worked with Rev Racing, NASCAR’s Drive for Diversity program. They attended a race in Dover, Delaware and received media credentials to film content for social media videos. Another student created graphics for Spring Mill State Park.  Ultimately, the MAS grad program wants to continue to connect and have dialogue with companies in the emergent technology and media industry. “We still have a lot of work to do in this space in Indiana. Opportunities exist, but perception is reality,” Gormal says. “We also need to prepare for the changes that are happening in the industry. More freelance opportunities are happening, as well as work from home options and non-traditional project arrangements, and we have to prepare the students for these shifts.  “Change is rapid and I am proud of SoIC for investing the time and energy into preparing their graduates. They are listening and making the necessary shifts to position their students for success when they walk out of this university.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

The app was created for AMPATH, a consortium of 11 North American academic health centers led by Indiana University School of Medicine, that partners with Moi University School of Medicine to create a model health care system in Kenya.  “Shahidi enables health providers to do a keyword search in a management mode where they can download and select media they want to show patients,” said Thomas Lewis , a lecturer in the media arts and science program in the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI . Providers can then send the selected media to a patient section of the app, where it can be viewed by patients while maintaining the security of any sensitive data on the device.  [Thomas Lewis](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/thomas-lewis/)  [IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI](https://luddy.iupui.edu/)  To develop Shahidi — which means “witness” in Swahili — Lewis said the team looked at how a mobile device would be used within the doctor/patient context, specifically the various functions associated with a provider selecting media to be viewed and a patient viewing that media.  “We thought about that as we structured the logic of the application,” Lewis said. “And we wanted to keep it very clean and simple so that users would get that logic immediately.  “One objective is to provide consistent, useful health information, no matter which type of health care provider is caring for a patient,” Lewis said. “This app standardizes the medical information being presented and uses media to better engage with patients.”  Lewis partnered with Todd Shelton , another media arts and science lecturer, and Mike Lulgjuraj, a School of Informatics and Computing staff member, to develop Shahidi.  [Todd Shelton](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/todd-shelton/)  Lewis began to work with the IU School of Medicine around media technology for health care in resource-limited settings through a 2012 IU International Development Fund grant. He collaborated with Dr. Rachel Vreeman, director of research for the IU Center for Global Health, and her team in Kenya to create story-based videos as part of a package of resources to support families informing children of their HIV status.  The video resources are now being evaluated across eight of AMPATH’s largest pediatric HIV clinics in Kenya as part of a National Institutes of Health-funded clinical trial called Helping AMPATH Disclose Information and Talk about HIV Infection. After AMPATH and HADITHI received a donation of Nexus Tablets from Google, Lewis further adapted the videos to be shown by counselors in their interactions with caregivers and children.  “I developed an application for the videos so they would be contextualized,” Lewis said. “We created a delivery system so that the themes and relevant counseling materials would be intuitive and easy for the counselors to access and use with families, even with limited training.”  That work caught the attention of Dr. Martin Were, another IU School of Medicine physician and AMPATH’s chief medical information officer. Were then asked Lewis to develop a mobile medical media application that could be used more generally by health professionals and patients as part of a larger mobile health project, “Mobile Technology for Life.” Called mUzima, the project aims to provide generalizable mobile-device solutions for use within resource-limited settings. MUzima currently includes functionality for data collection, historical data retrieval and mobile teleconsultation.  The Shahidi application developed by Lewis, Shelton and Lulgjuraj works seamlessly as part of the mUzima application and can be used with Android smartphones or tablets. Shahidi can play media used by this innovative health care system for patients in Kenya and other places. Media types supported include videos, PDF’s, images and audio.  In the future, the app could be enhanced so it will maintain a record of what media patients have viewed and suggest media playlists based on patient responses to various medical questions.  But the app could offer a new instructional approach to fields beyond health care. “I think we’re just beginning to see the start of something here,” Lewis said.  “Demonstrations that visually present information or explain aspects of health care can be far more effective than trying to explain something verbally,” Lewis said. “Video technology has been around for a long time, but when it is coupled with mobile technology, we see the dawning of exciting new ways to present visual information in any context.”  Courtesy: Richard Schneider, IU Communications   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## HCI student team “Green Basket” wins Agrinovus HungerTech Challenge  October 4, 2023  Luddy Indianapolis Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) students—Shreyas Patel, Drishti Dinesh Jogadia, Nisarg Hiteshkumar Rajpura, and Aditya Suresh Nair—won big at the 2023 HungerTech challenge! Team “Green Basket”, one of 18 participating groups, won the challenge sponsored by local nonprofit Agrinovus, which netted them a $25,000 prize to commercialize their solution.  In partnership with Elevance Health, the 2023 HungerTech Challenge tasks innovators with creating and implementing tech-enabled business solutions that connect targeted populations experiencing food insecurity to for-profit and not-for-profit food networks.  Winning team GreenBasket developed CropSpots, a click-and-collect model that delivers farmer’s market goods to areas of frequent community engagement instead of homes. With delivery costs not being covered by the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), participants can opt-in for group deliveries that allow that cost to be divided and much more manageable.  HCI is the discipline concerned with enhancing the user experience, designing better ways to help people engage with emerging technologies, employing the tools of human-centered design, social computing research, and the Internet of Things.  Andrew Miller, chair of the Department of Human-Centered Computing  at Luddy Indianapolis, said, “The Green Basket team’s innovative solution is a perfect example of how Luddy Indianapolis HCI students apply human-centered design skills to address real-world problems.”  Read more about the Hunger Tech Challenge  [Read more about the Hunger Tech Challenge](https://agrinovusindiana.com/2023/06/12/agrinovus-indiana-announces-winners-of-2023-hungertech-innovation-challenge/?fbclid=IwAR09Xmh889l6BlHOZX7yZ-CQWw6gjZOiV_ajA2veUmwR3wcFgdlPIoY5zhY)   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Record number of HCI faculty papers accepted by 2018 ACM CHI Conference  February 5, 2018  Four Department of Human-Centered Computing (HCC) faculty in the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI have had a total of six full papers accepted for publication by the prestigious 2018 ACM CHI Conference .  [2018 ACM CHI Conference](https://chi2018.acm.org/)  Andrew Miller , Lynn Dombrowski , Erin Brady , and Khairi Reda , all assistant professors of human-computer interaction (HCI), will present their papers in Montreal this April, along with their students and collaborators.  [Andrew Miller](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/andrew-miller/)  [Lynn Dombrowski](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/lynn-dombrowski/)  [Erin Brady](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/erin-brady/)  [Khairi Reda](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/khairi-reda/)  The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) was founded in 1947 and is the largest and oldest international scientific and industrial computer society. ACM CHI is the premiere academic research conference in computer-human interaction (CHI), one of the largest in the ACM. More than 3,000 researchers from all over the world attend the annual conference to share the latest research innovations in the field.  Acceptance rates are highly competitive at about 20 percent, with thousands of paper submissions each year, which speaks to the top-notch quality of those accepted and their visibility in the broader research community. The School of Informatics and Computing researchers’ papers cover a range of HCI topics, from health care to accessible computing, data-driven policing, and information visualization.  Davide Bolchini , HCC professor and chair of the HCC Department, said, “We are very excited to see this collective record number of high-quality full papers from our faculty accepted at such a competitive research conference. The national visibility of the findings of these studies will continue to raise the profile of the department and the school in the community of top research scholars and institutions in the field.”  [Davide Bolchini](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/davide-bolchini/)  Miller’s paper, “Supporting Collaborative Health Tracking in the Hospital: Patients’ Perspectives,” examines how computing technologies could empower patients to be more involved with tracking their own health information during a hospital stay, keeping everyone—providers, patients, and their families— in the loop throughout a hospital stay, and ultimately leading to improved patient safety and post-hospital outcomes.  Dombrowski, and lead author Nitya Verma, a Ph.D. candidate in HCI, take a close look at how data collection is changing law enforcement practices. Their paper, “Challenges when Adopting Data-Driven Policing Strategies,” tackles the subject of social concerns regarding police conduct within marginalized communities. Dombrowski’s second publication, “Accountability in the Blue-Collar Data Driven Workplace,” focuses on how blue-collar workers—like electricians—generate, share, and document information and how the need for data impacts transparency, privacy, and accountability in the workplace.  Verma and Dombrowski’s publication also received an Honorable Mention Award, ranking it among the top five percent of all submissions at this year’s CHI Conference. Of the over 2500 papers accepted, only 101 were chosen for this award.  Brady and her coauthors—three HCI graduate students—examine how accessibility affects activism for persons with physical disabilities in “Slacktivists or Activists?: Identity Work in the Virtual Disability March.”  Brady’s second paper, “Smart Kitchens for People with Cognitive Impairments: A Qualitative Study of Design Requirements,” describes a study of communal kitchens used by people with cognitive impairments.  Reda’s publication, “Graphical Perception of Continuous Quantitative Maps: the Effects of Spatial Frequency and Colormap Design,” addresses the challenge of designing effective yet aesthetically pleasing maps. The paper presents a series of perceptual experiments testing how well people are able to read quantitative maps, and provides color-encoding guidelines for designers.  The Department of Human-Centered Computing at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI offers degrees at both the undergraduate and graduate level that explore the intersection of people and technology. Within the department, the Master of Science and Ph.D. programs in Human-Computer Interaction specifically teach the design, development, and evaluation of humanly usable information technologies and the user experience surrounding interactive systems.

    "body": "  ## MAS class project blossoms into bicycle safety Web site for Riley Hospital  August 26, 2009  When Dr. Karen Stroup, IU School of Medicine, and Janet Everly, IU School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences visited Edgar Huang’s Media Arts and Science class last year, they arrived with an idea for a Web site.  The duo left having planted a seed that eventually blossomed into a high profile offering by Riley Hospital for Children.  Stroup and Everly were interested in creating a Web site that would teach teens and college students how to develop a bicycle safety course in their communities.  Julie Andrews, a student in Huang’s class took on the assignment.  Working with four graduate students in the IU Department of Occupational Therapy, and others, the team created a prototype for the Racing for Safety Web site.  After some additional refinements, the Racing for Safety Web site was officially launched this month.  It is a featured item on Riley Hospital’s Web home page.  “This partnership united student talent and resources of the IU School of Informatics and Computing, the IU School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, and Riley Hospital, a part of the IU School of Medicine,” explained Dr. Stroup.  “Graduate students from the IU Department of Occupational Therapy and an undergraduate student from the IU School of Informatics and Computing worked together as part of respective course requirements to develop the prototype.”  The Racing for Safety Web site was produced as a Web-based tool for teens and college age students engaged in community service and service learning to help prevent and reduce bike-related injuries and fatalities to children and to demonstrate that safety is for kids who use all kinds of wheels.  Huang, associate professor, IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, has long encouraged students to become engaged in community service projects.  “Service learning is a central focus of IUPUI’s mission,” explained Huang, who serves as a faculty representative for the campus’ service learning initiatives. “I am very proud of my student Julie Andrews and all others who assisted in development of the Racing for Safety Web site.”  The Web site provides the tools and resources needed for teens and college age students to plan and present a bike safety course for all children of all abilities using all kinds of wheeled vehicles, including bikes, adapted bikes, wheelchairs, scooters, skateboards, and rollerblades. Adult advocates for child safety and injury prevention interested in presenting a bike safe course in their community also would find the Web site to be a helpful resource and reference.  “Dr. Huang and Riley Hospital Community Education and Child Advocacy have worked together for several years in a creative partnership that nurtures frequent exchanges of ideas and possibilities,” said Stroup.  Such collaborations are prime examples of why service learning is a powerful tool for higher education, said Huang.  Other partners in the collaboration include the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Productions, and the Think First National Injury Prevention Foundation.     ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

The short film, Overcompensation,a comedy about mistaken identity, was co-directed by current Media Arts and Science student, Josh Houchin, who also won the competition two years ago, and School of Informatics and Computing (SOIC) alum, Tony Cardinali.  Several other School of Informatics and Computing alums filled key roles on the film as well including Kurtis Rush, cowriter; Jeremiah Nickerson, director of photography; Jason Silverman, and Matt Runyan  Overcompensation won awards for best directing, best cinematography, best acting and was named the best overall film of the competition.  Kurtis Rush believes his education combined with the rigorous course work from the School of Informatics and Computing helped to prepare his team for success at the competition.  “Media Arts and Science grads understand how to work under tight deadlines,” said Rush. “Participating in the 48 Hour Film project is a grueling task, it feels like we’re back in college pulling all-nighters in the labs.”  The annual Indianapolis 48 Hour Film Project requires teams of filmmakers to write, shoot, direct, and edit an entire film in a forty-eight hour timespan.  The filmmakers are given free reign to create the film they see fit with only a few caveats.  The filmmakers are given required elements that must appear in the film.  This year’s competition required filmmakers to insert the line “When do you want to start?” the character Dan or Dana Fox, and a purse as a prop.     ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

For one team, that’s led to their video being featured on an organization’s website, as a marketing and information tool.  [School of Informatics and Computing](https://luddy.iupui.edu/)  Students Sophia Jaegly, Phillip Rowan, and Boda Zhang were working as a team in adjunct lecturer John Scofield’s Intermediate Digital Video class, NEWM-N 353.  [Intermediate Digital Video](https://luddy.iupui.edu/courses/newm-n353/)  “I had assigned them to produce a video for an Indianapolis business that could be used as a web commercial or TV commercial,” Scofield says. “Their 3-minute video produced for the Indiana Youth Services Association has been selected to be featured on their site because it so effectively explains agency services.”  [Indiana Youth Services Association](https://indysb.org/)      Having their video prominently posted on the agency’s website was a great perk, and something the students can add to their portfolios and resumes as they seek career opportunities such as internships and employment.  [posted on the agency’s website](https://indysb.org/credential/)  “This is quite an accomplishment for their team and I’m very proud to share their efforts,” Scofield says.   ### Industry-standard skills  Students specializing in Video Production and Sound Design can collaborate with community service and nonprofit organizations to produce real-world projects while earning a bachelor of science degree in Media Arts and Science .  [Video Production and Sound Design](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/undergraduate/media-arts/video-sound/)  [Media Arts and Science](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/undergraduate/media-arts/)  “As an owner of a local video production company,” Scofield says, “on this final video assignment I wanted the students to produce and edit a 90-second web or TV commercial video, as this is a skill very highly required in today’s video business.”  Each of the nine student teams worked with a nonprofit organization.  “Once the teams of 3 to 4 students completed their videos I submitted them to all of the organizations for them to screen,” he says. “All of the organizations gave great remarks about the videos made about them.”   ### Helping kids and communities  The student team of Jaegly, Rowan, and Zhang worked with the Indiana Youth Services Association, which focuses on community education, advocacy for youth, juvenile delinquency prevention, and information and referral services.  “The incredible thing about opportunities like this is the connections you can make along the way,” says Jaegly. “I never imaged that by working on a video for the Indiana Youth Services Association, I’d be in a nationally recognized training program.”  The association provides professional development certification for child and youth workers, which is what the SoIC student team’s video highlighted. Their footage featured actual certified practitioners working with kids and talking about certification is allowing them to help their communities and local youths.  “The professional development that comes from working with people in your community is a product of just that—community—and the connections of sharing a belief in each other,” Jaegly says.  IYSA notes there are 275 certified practitioners in Indiana, working for employers including the Indiana and Butler universities, Purdue Extension, YWCA, Martin Luther King Center, Indiana Department of Education, county youth services, local school districts, Big Brothers Big Sisters, Boys and Girls Clubs, and other organizations.     ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Connor Bryant: Internship leads to West Coast move  June 29, 2022  SoIC graduate Connor Bryant learned the software development skills he needed to pursue his dream job—thanks to his classes, and an internship and scholarship he landed through the IU School of Informatics and Computing (SoIC) at IUPUI.  Bryant interned at TutorDudes while he was a student, doing everything from full-stack development to working as a Web and social media design/graphic intern. And after graduating this spring with his B.A. in Media Arts and Science, he headed to the West Coast to work as a video game engineering intern at Refactor Games.  “It’s a little bit surreal moving from Indiana to California,” he posted recently online, “and I’m excited to pursue game development.”   ### Getting real-world experience early  As a student Bryant was selected to receive an RJE Knoll Internship Scholarship, open to SoIC undergraduates who pursue an internship that is not otherwise financially supported.  “I wanted to go into software development,” says Bryant, “either web or game development. And I learned those skills at TutorDudes, a digital learning platform where students and teachers meet for online instruction.  “I learned a lot in the classroom, but it’s helpful to have real-world experience.”  As a TutorDudes intern, he was able to put many of the skills he learned from his SoIC instructors into practice.  “The skill set I used as a full-stack developer included design experience as well as technical know-how,” he says. “I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in my internship to complete work on the website.”   ### Getting started early  Bryant’s journey at the School of Informatics and Computing began while he was still in high school.  “I chose to major in Media Arts and Science after attending summer camps in game development and 3D modeling,” he says. “I became enamored of these two things and wanted to learn as much as I could about them.”  Obtaining the internship with TutorDudes fit in with his degree and career plans, Bryant explained.  “I specialized in the game and 3D graphics track for my major” at SoIC, he says, “and I thought the (TutorDudes) internship could possibly lead to a job in the tech industry. So I was very excited, I wanted to learn more about software development through this internship.”   ### Goals align  Versatility is essential in professional life, as Bryant learned during his internship at TutorDudes. He drew upon different skills sets he acquired at SoIC.  “TutorDudes has a digital learning (SaaS) platform that provides tailored subject tutoring solutions to a student’s learning style.  “I was originally going to be working within the Gaming Division creating educational gaming products,” he explained, “but my role shifted to full-stack web development, and I worked on a web conferencing application.  “This internship (at TutorDudes) helped me with my professional goals of becoming a web or game developer.”     ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

[iDEW, the Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce program](https://luddy.iupui.edu/idew)  End-of-semester student project showcases at each high school illustrated the creativity and IT skills of the student teams, who are tasked with creating a real-world application of what they’ve learned. For example, data visualization projects covered topics such as crime rates, immigration, government spending, student GPAs, and counting calories.  The iDEW program grew significantly in the 2016-17 school year, extending the reach of the initiative and opportunities for Indianapolis students. More than 260 Indianapolis high school students have now taken classes through iDEW, a nationally recognized STEM program created by the Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI. The program builds a direct pipeline to post-secondary IT education and IT careers, focusing on opportunities for women and underrepresented minority students. ​  “Students are very excited about what they can learn in this program,” says Douglas Coats, department chair of business and IT education at Pike High School, where iDEW class offerings are increasing to meet the student demand.  The inaugural 2015 iDEW program started with three classes. There are now 14 classes (which includes a new class at Northwest High School), where students follow a project-based curriculum designed by faculty at the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI that covers subjects such as mobile trivia apps, the Internet of Things, video games, and data visualization. Learning modules covering chatbots and robotics will be introduced next year. Student teams have completed 150 IT semester-end projects since the program began.  Students participate in iDEW through their senior years. And the length of the program is matched in depth—iDEW doesn’t stop when school is out of session. Many students enrolled in iDEW classes are involved in iDEW learning experiences this summer, through high school Summer Workshops at the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, industry visits, internships at Lilly and Cummins, and IT certification training at Ivy Tech Community College.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Luddy IUPUI students access lifetime memories and opportunities at GHC 2022  February 8, 2023  In fall 2022, Luddy IUPUI students Iyonna Brooks, Megan Castrataro, Mariam Khan, Yukta Karkera, Iqra Syed, Varesha Durrani, Sarah Nikkhah, Hinal Kiri, and Aditi Shukla attended the Grace Hopper Celebration in Orlando, Florida.  [Grace Hopper Celebration](https://ghc.anitab.org/)  AnitaB.org produces Grace Hopper Celebration (GHC) in collaboration with the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). GHC is the world’s largest gathering of women and non-binary technologists. According to the GHC website, those who attend GHC “gain access to career and academic workshops, networking opportunities, inspirational role models, and memories that will last a lifetime.”  Several of the students shared their thoughts and experiences.   ### Iqra Syed, undergraduate, Informatics  “Having the opportunity to attend the Grace Hopper conference was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Being able to network with Fortune 500 companies and meet people from all over the world really opened my eyes. The conference made me value my education and even think about all the different career paths I can take. It was also an honor to represent the School as a woman in STEM,” Syed said.   ### Iyonna Brooks, undergraduate, Informatics  “My time at Grace Hopper was amazing. I was able to make connections and talk to different fortune 500 companies. I wouldn’t be able to connect if I hadn’t taken this opportunity. The experience showed me that there are opportunities in tech for everyone. I’ve made connections with others I can reach out to after the event. I gained confidence that helped me realize I picked the right career. I was able to have so many options within tech that are endless to grow and learn from. I received offers from world-renowned companies to work for. If I go back I will do it all again. I will forever remember Grace Hopper Conference,” Brooks said.   ### Yukta Karkera, master’s student, HCI  “As a Woman in Tech, I have followed the Grace Hopper conference for the last four years. Its mission and implementation are beyond inspiring and truly keeps the spirit of supporting my fellow women in tech alive,” Karkera said.  During the conference Karkera attended a few panels, talks, workshops and the Career Expo. Each of these events gave her something to take back home with her. The panels, workshops and talks gave her an insight into the inner working of some of the top companies, their working strategies, and skills that they value, which facilitated me to analyze and choose the skills that she would want to develop before she entered the industry.  Karkera said the Expo was a whole different experience altogether. The representative at some of the stalls provided a review session where they reviewed resumes and portfolios and some of the other representatives helped attendees understand what skills were valued by each of the companies.  “In the start, the magnitude of the conference was a little overwhelming but having the IUPUI student group together helped make the experience, as the Orlando Kingpin Disney would say, magical!,” Karkera said.   ### Hinal Kiri, M.S., HCI  Kiri noted that the Grace Hopper Conference is one of the most popular events among women in technology and is known for its networking and learning opportunities—be it the field of Product Management, Interactive Media and Arts, Software development, or UX Design. She said attending the conference in person at Orlando rightfully delivered on all these expectations, if not more. Not only did she meet people from very diverse backgrounds and ethnicities, but she also learned how women in technology can support each other for a lasting, revolutionary impact.  “It was enlightening to hear about the ongoing industrial, political, and academic reforms in creating empowering workspaces for women that help echo the voice from the margins to the global platforms—as that of GHC. The experiences and positivity of the event were surreal,” Kiri said.   ### Sarah Nikkhah, PhD candidate, HCI  Nikkhah shared that having the opportunity to attend GHC helped her learn from some of the brightest women in her field. It also provided her a chance to network and share her work with her peers and help better define her role as a woman in computing. Nikkhah attended VGHC in 2020 as well as a GHC scholar from Luddy IUPUI. She also attended Women & Hi Tech and the Indiana Celebration of Women In Computing. “These experiences showed me the importance of women supporting each other and sharing their experiences and challenges with each other. Attending GHC gave me the opportunity to meet, network, and learn from my peers and share my work and experiences as a woman in computing in a way that no other event could due to the scale of the conference. It helped me build long-term friendships and initiate future collaborations that will help make strengthen the bond between us as women in computing,” she said.  Nikkhah said that building long-lasting relationships, collaborations and sharing and learning about other women’s challenges and solutions in this field are things that she takes every opportunity to do. “As a fifth-year PhD student at Luddy IUPUI, I am fortunate that I get to work with many professors, undergraduate and graduate students and people from my community, many of them women. I worked as a Graduate representative and Graduate Ambassador for Luddy that provided me the opportunity to give back to our school. This high level of interaction and collaboration, along with an event like GHC, which fosters the opportunity to learn and grow from some of the best minds in our field, gives me the ability to teach what I’ve learned to many other people,” she said.  Nikkhah got her job offer from Eli Lilly and Company during the GHC conference, and she plans to join Lilly after graduation. She also got the opportunity to meet many talented people from the largest companies and expand her network. “As a group of HCI students from Luddy, we had a messaging group, and we shared exciting events with each other that helped a lot in finding events related to User experience and attending related networking events and talks. One of the wonderful people I met at GHC was working at LinkedIn and with generosity provided me with a 6-month LinkedIn premium. We got invited to receptions and private events held by big companies such as Google and Amazon to help expand our network and learn about the company culture,” she added. “GHC in person was a wonderful opportunity, and I appreciate our school and GHC for supporting me in attending.”   ### Aditi Shukla, master’s student, HCI  Shukla came across Grace Hopper Celebration while in conversation with an alumnus in the 2nd semester of her master’s degree, and the spirit of the conference intrigued her to such an extent that she applied for both the official AnitaB.org scholarship as well as the one offered by Luddy, receiving both and getting the opportunity to attend GHC’22 in person.  [AnitaB.org scholarship](https://ghc.anitab.org/attend/scholarships/)  “GHC was a dream opportunity for me where I got the chance to connect with professionals and interact with Product Managers and Designers working in organizations of the likes of Google, Amazon, Disney, etcetera, and attend talks, workshops, and presentations on topics ranging from professional development to industry trends and more,” Shukla said. “A particular highlight was during one such workshop, I ended up sitting at a table with the team of Rec Room, a social virtual reality application. Incidentally, I had been working on a few VR-related projects, one of which was centered around social VR applications, and this came as an unexpected moment where I got to connect and speak with the creators of such a product. I feel immensely grateful to the university for sponsoring my attendance and giving me the opportunity to be in the presence of truly awe-inspiring people and hearing their inspirational stories.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Carmel High School Students Win First Prize in the Informatics App Challenge at IUPUI  October 28, 2014  Two Carmel High School students won first prize in the App Challenge hosted by the School of Informatics and Computing (SoIC) Saturday, October 25, 2014 at the Informatics and Communications Technology Complex on IUPUI’s campus.  The competition was open to Indiana high school students. After a general session where students were briefly introduced to the School of Informatics and Computing, teams were challenged to create, develop and program from scratch an app version of the classic game of memory (concentration) in only 8 hours, with bonus for additional elements like scalable grid elements, levels of difficulty, animation, sound or additional media. The app had to be fully designed, programmed and finally browsable on an android mobile device.  The Winans Minions was the winning team made up of Atif Niyaz and Calvin Henry, mentored by Margaret Winans of Carmel High School. Second prize went to Think Tank, David Baker and Alexander Whaley, mentored by Mike Spock from Columbus North High School, and third prize went to Homeschool Mobile Design Team, Theodore Stumpf, Zachary Caldwell, and Meghan Stumpf, mentored by Bryan Stumpf from Lebanon, Indiana.  “It is so exciting to see the interest and passion that the students have in informatics and how they are getting into app design and development at an early age. We were very impressed with the level of knowledge and perseverance that all the teams had throughout the day. At 7.30 in the morning, even before the challenge started, students already had their computers and phones fired up and ready to code. This was an eight hour day that provided a setting similar to what a real world project might consist of, and the students did remarkably well managing their time and working with the parameters they were given,” said Davide Bolchini, Department Chair Human-Centered Computing.  Students engaged in design and sketching the interactive and user experience of their app, then moved quickly to fully coding the app and all its features. SoiC faculty Travis Faas and student volunteers answered questions, provided advice, tested the apps during development, and challenged the participants to do more.  Prizes went to the top three teams with the first place prize consisting of $500 cash for the team and $1,000 scholarships and research dollars to be used for an undergraduate degree at the SoIC at IUPUI, for each team member. School of Informatics and Computing alumni Taha Khan, The Basement Design and Motion and David Poindexter, NextGear Capital were judges. “This was an eye-opening experience, not just for the students but for us as judges and industry professionals. This competition showed us how much the interest in learning about technology has grown over the past few years, which will produce some great job candidates down the road,” said Poindexter.  This is the first year for the challenge with plans to make it an annual event.  View photos from the App Challenge  View the School of Informatics and Computing event calendar.

Sam Mirpoorian, who received his B.S. in May and is now enrolled in the master’s program, and Hannah West, a current senior, produced their films under the guidance of Media Arts and Science faculty member C. Thomas Lewis .  [C. Thomas Lewis](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/thomas-lewis/)  Mirpoorian’s short, Little Warriors , received this year’s Indiana Spotlight Film Award, winning $5000 and adding to accolades already earned at the Indy Film Festival, the Napa Valley Film Festival, and the Global Impact Film Festival.  Mirpoorian created the film for his senior Capstone project last spring. He attributes much of his success to the support he has received from the MAS program and his advisors. “The program is very hands-on and truly allows for filmmakers like myself to explore and unleash their abilities and interests. I mostly want to thank Professor Lewis as he provided excellent guidance and made sure I stayed on course,” Mirpoorian said.  As an undergraduate, he also produced Under the Bridge: The Criminalization of Homelessness , which received critical acclaim last year and has been released for commercial distribution.  West’s film, Not in Vain , was a class project created for the Video for Social Change course. She has entered it in several other festivals, but is especially interested in sharing it with a wider audience. She, too, credits Lewis for her success. “I’m very thankful for his help, support, and guidance on this project, as well as throughout my undergrad degree work,” West said.  [Video for Social Change](https://luddy.iupui.edu/courses/newm-n468/)  The Media Arts and Science undergraduate degree with specialization in video production and sound design introduces students to the latest technical skills required in the video and sound industry and prepares them to develop, produce, and ultimately deliver a professional-quality product.  “In the Media Arts and Science video courses, we educate students to create professional-level films that engage in important social issues. It is truly rewarding when we see our students get the recognition they deserve for their hard work,” Lewis said.  Little Warriors captures a group of Indianapolis youth and their impassioned attempt to introduce legislation that would address climate recovery. Mirpoorian is waiting to hear back from several more film festivals and is hoping to have Little Warriors aired on PBS later this year.

She pointed out that opioid abuse is a problem that is affecting many Hoosiers as early as high school, and she hoped that the film could create a dialogue with students.  Mirpoorian and West recognize the impact the IU School of Informatics and Computing, and the MAS program in specific, has had on their filmmaking careers so far, and how it has prepared them for the future.  “I’m both excited and nervous about what is coming next for myself after graduation, but I know I’ve been equipped with the skills to go out there and make it work. My advice to students entering this program would be to make the most of what you have available to you while you have it. Throw your all into every project. If you give it one hundred percent, you’ll be shocked how much knowledge and experience you’ll leave school with,” West said.  Mirpoorian added, “I hope fellow students can use the resources made available to Hannah and me and channel them into their own projects. The time to produce work is now, so persevere and the guidance you seek will be availed through the resources provided by the school’s programs.”     ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Informatics students and local professionals to overhaul four non-profits’ websites in just 48 hours  January 11, 2011  Local web design students and professionals will be pulling out all the stops this weekend to develop and launch brand-new websites for four Indianapolis non-profit organizations in just 48 non-stop hours.  The project – now in its second year – partners top student talent from the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI with professionals from RefreshIndy, a local organization of web designers, developers and graphic artists. They’ll eat, sleep and work in the school’s computer labs and classrooms to deliver fresh, fully-operational websites on time and with absolutely no budget – all in the name of community service and professional development.  It’s a service of immeasurable value for the fortunate non-profits chosen, which include Indy East Asset Development, Teacher’s Treasures, Anna’s Celebration of Life Foundation and the Sustainable Library Citizens Coalition. Organizations were selected based on demonstrated need for a new or enhanced website, as well as future ability to maintain that website.  All not only lack sophisticated websites to adequately support their missions, engage their communities and raise public awareness, but also the resources to afford professional web services. A single website of the quality each non-profit will receive would normally cost thousands to tens of thousands of dollars.  But for these organizations? Not a penny.  Pulling this all off will be no easy feat for the nearly 30 students and professionals involved, as the amount of work done – which will include design, development, photography and video – would likely take a professional two or more weeks under normal circumstances.  But their payoff is tremendous, as professional volunteers from local companies such as MediaSauce, Mango Tree, Media Fuel and Web Easy Media get the chance to give back to their community and mentor young talent. And for the student volunteers, the experience represents a unique service learning opportunity and occasion to network with industry professionals.  This non-stop event begins at 6:00 p.m. on Friday, January 14 at the Informatics and Communication Technology Complex on the IUPUI campus. The date leads into IUPUI’s annual Martin Luther King, Jr. Day of Service encouraging students, faculty and staff to give back to the greater Indianapolis community.  In addition to the School of Informatics and Computing, IUPUI and RefreshIndy, sponsors and supporters include the IUPUI Solution Center, Yats, Marriot Place Hotel and the National Institute for Fitness and Sport.  You can follow along with the weekend’s activities around-the-clock on Twitter using hashtag #48hrweb.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

Klann, also in his third year as a medical informatics fellow at the Regenstrief Institute, was recognized for his paper titled “A method to compute treatment suggestions from local order-entry data.” The paper details his work to produce condition-specific treatment suggestions based entirely on physician treatment data. Reminder systems have been proven to help physicians take better and more efficient care of their patients, but are few in number because content must be meticulously maintained by local experts.  In his 2010 paper, Klann builds upon his previous research that applied an e-commerce metaphor to physicians’ treatment decisions and recommendations. This research earned Klann best student paper finalist recognition by AMIA in 2009.  Though insightful, e-commerce algorithms do not capture the complexities and nuances of patient care. So instead, Klann’s newest research uses Bayesian networks algorithms to produce condition-specific treatment suggestions. Outcomes were evaluated during one year of physician visits involving pregnancy and were found to produce meaningful, non-trivial and generally correct suggestions that mimicked treatments suggested by an obstetric nurse in 71% of instances.  Klann hopes to continue expanding this basic methodology to support larger and more complex models that can be used to develop general tools for decision and content support, compliance monitoring and even decision support systems driven entirely by local data.   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

This course is intended for Informatics students who need a grounding in research methods.  Academic research is activity intended to advance and develop the body of human knowledge, through posing questions about the world and systematically identifying answers to those questions. Systematicity implies rigor, and a spectrum of different rigorous practices have been developed to answer questions in different fields of academic inquiry. These practices are known as research methods, and they govern the most basic research processes, from recording observations to analysis and interpretation. The nature of the knowledge developed by a research study and the proper interpretation of the study itself depends on the choice of research methods it employs.  Informatics research relies on a broad range of methods, some of which come from the social sciences, that is, those academic disciplines such as psychology, sociology, linguistics, and anthropology (among others), which seek to understand and improve the world of human experience. Social science research methods vary on a number of dimensions: some involve highly detailed observations in a small number of specific circumstances (e.g., ethnographic observation of workplace interactions around a database system), while others require coarse observations of low detail from a large number of circumstances (e.g., a survey of a large user group); some involve deep interpretation engaging the researcher’s knowledge of the situation being observed (e.g., in a content analysis of information policy documents), while others disclaim relevance of the researcher’s specific knowledge of the situation (e.g. in quantitative studies of information traffic patterns).  No one method suffices to answer all questions within Informatics, and so researchers in this field need to be conversant with the full range of possibilities available to them. The primary goal of this course is to fill this need by surveying a broad range of research methods and their theoretical motivations and justifications, emphasizing fit of different research methods to different research questions. It provides a foundation for both interpreting and conducting many types of research, as well as a starting point for further study of specific research methods.   ### Policies and Procedures  Please be aware of the following linked policies and procedures.

On Friday, April 26, 4:00-8:00 P.M., graduating students from the School of Informatics and Computing will be presenting their Capstone projects.      The Capstone is the culmination of a student’s academic experience, and an opportunity to demonstrate competence in various aspects of study within the School of Informatics and Computing. With skill sets firmly in place, students design and complete a faculty-mentored capstone project during their final semester. This project signals a student’s readiness to graduate and is a showcase of their knowledge and skill within their chosen specialty area(s).  While for some, a Capstone will demonstrate their particular specialty, many projects require the application of several different kinds of experiences and expertise. All are the result of many, many hours of work possibly in a computer animation lab, or grasping the intricacies of databases and project management.  Students, faculty, staff, employers, families, and the public are invited to attend the Capstone presentations and to talk with students about their projects. New this year, there will also be projects and posters featured from students in Health Information Administration and Informatics.

    "body": "  ## LIS-S 585 Archival Appraisal and Management  3 credits  [schedule](https://sisjee.iu.edu/sisigps-prd/web/igps/course/search/)   ### Description  Appraisal is often considered the most important process of developing an archive, but without agreed upon standards, how does one go about deciding what has permanent value? Incorporating a strong theoretical foundation with practical approaches, we will explore our responsibilities to the profession, the documentary heritage we steward, and the communities we serve. This course explores the archivist’s most important responsibility: appraisal. Students survey the theories, techniques, and methods that archivists use to identify documents and other materials of enduring value for long-term preservation, access, and use. Students explore why archival materials are being accepted (or selected) for an archive; how society or an organization is “documented”; how archival materials are being used, by whom, and why. Students will also study the history of appraisal and compare divergent contemporary approaches and study the work of various repositories. Emphasis is placed on professionally responsible accountability to contemporaries and the future. By the end of the class, students can conduct an appraisal analysis and design an appraisal or acquisition policy for a collecting institution to serve the archives larger mission.   ### Program Learning Goals Supported  Instructors map their courses to specific LIS Program Goals . Mapped program goals drive the design of each course and what students can expect to generally learn.  [LIS Program Goals](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/masters/mlis/program-goals.html)   ### Learning Outcomes  Instructors develop learning outcomes for their courses. Students can expect to be able to achieve the learning outcomes for a given course after successfully completing the course.   ### Course Overview  Instruction is in Canvas. Lessons are organized into Modules whose length may vary.  Module 1: Course Overview; Introduction to Appraisal  Module 2: Foundations of Appraisal Theory  This is a tour of foundational theories of appraisal that still resonate throughout the profession as to what constitutes archival value. While perhaps dated, understanding these are essential to understanding professional developments over the past several decades:  Module 3: Macro-Appraisal, Functional Analysis, Documentation Strategies, etc.  This module focuses on some broad methodologies that emerged subsequent to the foundational theories as to how appraisal activities could/should evolve:  Module 4: Synthesizing Appraisal Thought into Practice  Shifting from theory and conceptual methodology, this module focuses on establishing specific criteria on which to base any appraisal analysis. Examples are provided to demonstrate how criteria can be applied and how they influence collection development. The notion of use as a potential criteria is explored in some detail.  Module 5: Collection Development and Policies  You examine reasons to have written mission statements and collection development policies, including how they help manage expectations and serve as a useful management tool in focusing and supporting a repository's efforts. You also look at some common elements of what a solid collection policy should include.  Module 6: Sampling and Case Files  This module looks at approaches to dealing with large sets of materials, such as case files. You explore different methods of sampling as an acceptable appraisal and selection approach and how to ensure sampling results in representative collections that support a repository's mission. Youl also look as some specific cases studies in how archives have applied a sampling approach to specific record series.  Module 7: Appraising Born Digital Records  You discuss technical considerations related to appraisal and electronic records. How is the appraisal of born-digital records different from appraising analog, paper-based records? You also explore some emerging tools and approaches to dealing with the complexities electronic records present to the appraisal function of archives.  Module 8: Appraising and Acquiring Personal Papers  You discuss some elements to factor into an appraisal of personal papers, including electronic personal records. This includes understanding the multifaceted persona individuals embody, as well as the social and cultural norms they reflect.  Module 9: Records Management and Retention Schedules  You review some basic concepts of records management and the records lifecycle and how these relate to appraisal. We will examine typical elements of records retention schedules and how they reflect appraisal analysis.  Module 10: Reappraisal and Deaccessioning  Starting with a definition of reappraisal, you discuss different professional perspectives on the appropriateness of reappraisal and reasons to undertake reappraisal. You explore some questions to ask to determine whether reappraisal is warranted and examine the professional standards for reappraisal and deaccessioning.  Module 11: Post-Modern Theory  Turning back to theory for a moment, you look at the influence of post-modern thinking on the archival profession and how it has impacted approaches to appraisal. You discuss how post-modernism represents a direct link to contemporary discourse on archival power and neutrality, which will be the focus of later modules.  Module 12: Appraisal Authority: Legal and Ethical Considerations  You review some legal considerations that influence appraisal, including:  You also explore ethical considerations related to the appraisal and acquisition of materials while considering the appraisal decisions reflected in specific case studies.  Module 13: Engaging Creators: Social Responsibility, Community, Power  Module 14: Engaging Creators: Identity, Memory, Culture, Diversity, Inclusion  You look at the mediation role of archivists when conducting appraisal and the implications this has in terms of memory, identity, diversity, and inclusion. You explore notions of personal context and bias and how the appraisal process not only assigns value but creates value and thereby creates history and memory.  Module 15: Archives Management and the Appraisal Nexus  This week you explore some approaches to archives management and how they impact and are reflected in appraisal.

    "body": "  ## Martin-Hammond receives NSF CAREER Award to fuel research on intelligent assistants for elders and social wellness  July 7, 2022  SoIC faculty member Aqueasha Martin-Hammond has received a prestigious CAREER Award from the National Science Foundation for her research project on designing AI conversational assistants to support older adults and their social wellness.  [Aqueasha Martin-Hammond](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/aqueasha-martin-hammond/)  Martin-Hammond (left), Ph.D., is an assistant professor of Human-Computer Interaction at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI. She will receive a total of $543,539 over five years for her project, “CAREER: Conversational User Interfaces to Support Older Adults’ Social Wellness” (NSF award number 2144503 ).  [School of Informatics and Computing](https://luddy.iupui.edu)  [2144503](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2144503&HistoricalAwards=false)  The Faculty Early Career Development ( CAREER ) Program offers the National Science Foundation’s most prestigious awards to support early-career faculty who have the potential to be academic role models in research and education and to lead advances in the mission of their department or organization. The NSF notes, “Activities pursued by early-career faculty should build a firm foundation for a lifetime of leadership in integrating education and research.”  [CAREER](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/faculty-early-career-development-program-career)   ### Artificial intelligence and aging  “Much research is needed to understand the potential and limitations of AI to enhance social well-being among the aging population,” says Davide Bolchini , Ph.D., who heads the Department of Human-Centered Computing at the School of Informatics and Computing. “This research is extremely timely.  [Davide Bolchini](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/davide-bolchini/)  [Human-Centered Computing](https://luddy.iupui.edu/hcc/)  “We are very excited to see this prestigious and highly competitive NSF award bestowed on Aqueasha, who is leading important research advances in designing the next generation of intelligent assistants for older adults.  “This NSF support gives Aqueasha a solid foundation for career-long scientific and educational contributions at the forefront of Human-Centered AI for our aging society,” says Bolchini, a professor of Human-Centered Computing at SoIC and director of its Human-Computer Interaction Program.   ### Bridging the gap with technology  Martin-Hammond’s CAREER project addresses the issue of older adults often becoming socially isolated and lonely, which can lead to other health challenges. Reasons can include relocating for retirement, becoming less mobile, and experiencing the loss of family and friends.  “The research is expected to reveal new conversational approaches that can benefit older adults’ social wellness,” she says, “while decreasing the risk of social isolation.”  To help elders remain socially active, Martin-Hammond will explore using AI-enabled interfaces such as voice assistants and chatbots to foster connections and improve social wellness.  “Today’s conversational assistants support the retrieval of information,” she notes, “but can fall short in helping older adults connect with their peers and leveraging the social fabric of these relationships to access meaningful local resources.  “Imagine a future where a tool, such as Amazon Alexa, could proactively remind us to call a relative on their birthday—or to go to a neighborhood event where our friends are going—by learning about our behaviors and preferences.”   ### Older adults to become advisers  For her CAREER project to support older adults’ social wellness, Martin-Hammond says she intends to engage elders in the design process.  “The goal is to develop interfaces that promote real-world social connections and motivate older adults to engage in social activities with other people,” she says. “Therefore it is important for us to engage older adults, to understand their needs.”  By adapting state-of-the-art conversational design methods, Martin-Hammond wants her work to improve how artificial intelligence serves older people, and how we approach the design of these systems.  “We hope to aid reflective thinking of the impact of artificially intelligent technologies on an increasingly aging society,” she says.  For example, people often discuss privacy concerns when thinking about whether to use AI-enabled technologies.  “Through our research, we plan to also address concerns such as privacy in the design process,” Martin-Hammond says, “and take what we learn to also create tools that designers of these systems can use to support reflective thinking when designing these technologies for the aging population.”  This latest NSF grant enables Martin-Hammond to continue her research involving technology and older adults. In 2021 she received a $498,904 National Science Foundation grant to explore how intelligent assistants, such as Siri and Alexa, can help elders with daily health-care information tasks at home. She serves as principal investigator for the project, “Designing Autonomy Preserving Interactions in Intelligent Assistants for Older Adults. ” Bolchini is co-principal investigator.

    "body": "  ## Andrew Miller receives National Science Foundation award  April 6, 2021  Andrew D. Miller , Ph.D., has been awarded a prestigious CAREER award from the National Science Foundation. Miller is an assistant professor in the Human-Centered Computing department at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI.  [Andrew D. Miller](https://luddy.iupui.edu/people/andrew-miller/)  [School of Informatics and Computing](https://luddy.iupui.edu)  The goal of Miller’s $520,935 five-year grant project, titled “ Family Resilience Technologies: Augmenting Caregiving Coordination Systems for Health Crisis Response ,” is to design breakthrough technologies that enable small groups to collaborate in even the most stressful of circumstances.  [Family Resilience Technologies: Augmenting Caregiving Coordination Systems for Health Crisis Response](https://tinyurl.com/2tr93b5a)  “During a crisis—such as a child’s hospitalization—parents, aunts, uncles, grandparents, and other close family and friends take on new roles as caregivers, staying connected while they coordinate care and support each other,” Miller says.  “Social computing technologies have great potential to support this close-knit collaboration, but most current technologies are designed using assumptions that may not hold true in the case of a family health crisis.”   ### A collaborative effort  Miller’s team will use human-centered research methods to design Family Resilience Technologies: next-generation caregiving coordination tools that support and enable resilient caregiving practices. Miller will work with families to collaboratively design and prototype next-generation caregiving coordination technologies that augment the ability of families to coordinate care.  The grant includes three phases:  The grant extends Miller’s NSF-funded work with pediatric cancer patients and their families, supporting Miller’s collaboration with the Pediatric Cancer & Blood Diseases department at Riley Hospital for Children.  The grant also will involve students from diverse backgrounds in research, and support interdisciplinary collaboration between the medical and computing communities. In addition, it will engage families as collaborators and learners through openly accessible online resources for families facing health crises.  The COVID-19 pandemic, Miller notes, has exposed the serious effects that isolation can have on patients, as well as the limits to communication that exist—and just how beneficial the power to connect with family can be.     ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

Sparks worked closely with the Center in the early 2000s developing and managing a new department, Geoinformatics, focusing on geospatial projects with both practical and applied emphasis—the same model used by Polis today. He returned to the Center in 2018 after 11 years as Indiana’s first Geographic Information Officer during which time he developed, maintained, and distributed comprehensive statewide geographic data. He led Indiana’s efforts to become a spatially enabled state, for which he has received national recognition.  Polis Center Executive Director David Bodenhamer says, “Jim Sparks has been masterful in helping The Polis Center develop effective university-government-community partnerships to use spatial information to improve and enhance the quality of life for Hoosiers. His vision, drive, and commitment to Polis and its partners leave the center well-placed to continue collaborating with community experts to understand the complex problems of today’s world and finding potential solutions.

    "body": "  ## Deadline to apply for HIT certificate program is April 15  March 26, 2012  Recent studies show the healthcare industry is likely to increase the hiring of health informaticists with both clinical and technical skills over the next two years, making this an ideal time to enroll in Health Information Technology certificate courses.  In collaboration with Regenstrief Institute, an internationally respected biomedical and public health informatics innovator dedicated to improving health by enhancing the quality and delivery of medical care, and the IU School of Medicine, the School of Informatics and Computing is once again offering specialized one-year IU graduate certificate and programs designed to increase the number of health IT specialists in Indiana and nationwide, thanks in part to funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act  (ARRA) of 2009. Deadline to apply for fall 2012 is April 15.  “HIT is booming from all different aspects, and yet, folks are not properly trained in how to use or implement the systems. What we’ve seen, anecdotally, is that employees are getting pushed more into managing HIT systems or implementing HIT systems who haven’t had the formal training and education to do so,” said J.T. Finnell, director and associate professor of Health Informatics. “Indiana is, without a doubt, a national leader in HIT. The windfall from the federal ARRA funds supports that fact. These funds are helping us combat the shortage of HIT workers in Indiana so we can sustain and strengthen the state’s HIT might.”  Finnell, who is also associate professor of emergency medicine for the Indiana University School of Medicine and research scientist for the Regenstrief Institute, said for those healthcare or information technology professionals interested in learning new skills and increasing job security, the one-year graduate programs in HIT are something to consider.  Each of the five programs is designed to develop much-needed and qualified health IT leaders for private and public health care organizations. These training programs include:  Qualified applicants must hold a four-year or advanced degree from an accredited institution and may include the following (please see the “Checklist for Accepted Students” document for tuition support eligibility details):   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

    "body": "  ## Students get a taste of movie magic with their very own film  April 22, 2010  Ever wondered what it would be like to make a movie? Not just a home video or a clip on YouTube, but an actual movie with a script, actors, professional equipment, special effects and an official world premiere? Students at the IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI are finding out first-hand.  Twenty-one students in the School’s Media Arts and Science undergraduate program have created an original short film as part of a course on video and production. The final product, titled Temporary Separation , is a 20-minute sci-fi mystery shot in high definition and finished on Blu-Ray with 5.1 sound and special features, including behind-the-scenes footage. It will screen at 5:00 p.m. on April 27 in “theater” 152 of IUPUI’s Informatics and Communications Technology Complex – a 200-seat auditorium with theater-quality projection and sound. The IUPUI and Indianapolis community are invited. There is no cost to attend or ticket required. A Facebook page (search “Temporary Separation”) in support of the film has been established.  [Informatics and Communications Technology Complex](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=535+W.+Michigan+St.+Indianapolis+IN+46202-3103)  [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com)  The semester-long class project came together under the direction of instructor C. Thomas Lewis. Lewis, a film and photography industry veteran whose credits include production of DVD bonus material for the Harry Potter film series, envisioned the course as a completely immersive and collaborative student experience. “The idea was to give students hands-on experience in the filmmaking process, from development through post-production,” said Lewis. “To really do that effectively, I wanted to simulate those scenarios student filmmakers are likely to encounter out in the industry.”  To get the project off the ground, each class period operated like a production meeting, with students taking on roles commonly found on film sets. Every student created his or her own one-page film proposal to verbally “pitch” to classmates. A class vote determined the best pitch. Each student then acted as screenwriter, building on the premise selected and writing a script in their own choice of style and genre. The class again chose its favorite and, five revisions later, put out a casting call attracting more than twenty-five actors for the film’s three unpaid roles. Students also scouted shooting locations to bring the script to life, eventually filming on the rooftop of Dunaway’s Restaurant, in Walker Plaza on Indiana Avenue and even in a student’s own home. With the cast and locations in place, students logged extensive hours filming and editing scenes on an aggressive schedule. Several shots were captured using chroma key, or green screen, technology for special effects added later in post-production.  Final edits are currently in progress in anticipation of the film’s premiere this Tuesday, and excitement is building among the student crew and their classmates. “I have never had such an intense learning experience,” says student Ben Masbaum. “I can’t wait to just sit back at the premiere and enjoy the show.”   ### Media Contact  Joanne Lovrinic jebehele@indiana.edu 317-278-9208 "

BioMap is an attempt to create a scalable knowledgebase of biological relationships extracted from vast amount of biomedical literature data. The development of BioMap system addresses several innovative research issues related to knowledge discovery from literature documents and real-time, interactive access of this knowledge. Specific problems that are being investigated are: discovering explicit , implicit and directional relationships among biological entities from abstracts and full text documents; discovering both explicit and implicit protein-protein interactions and computationally validating these interactions; and, obtaining novel pathways associated with specific diseases in question. Protein-protein, gene-protein, disease-drug interactions are examples of biological associations that are automatically discovered from large number of literature documents. BioMap can discover interactions in user specified biomedical problem domains such as inflammatory diseases, regenerative biology, cancer, etc., and provide a user-centric view of the knowledge that are discovered.  Intelligent Information Management Systems: There is a critical need for innovative information management and knowledge discovery tools to sift through vast volumes of heterogeneous data from various information sources. This project looks into developing Intelligent Software Systems that can integrate information resources and extract embedded knowledge from these information sources.   ### Related News "

Librarians should reflect the communities they serve. However, with the well-documented lack of diversity within the library profession, this isn’t always possible. The new Wilma Gibbs Moore Graduate Endowed Scholarship will provide support to students from underrepresented backgrounds to attend the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering to pursue a degree in library and information science.  By establishing the scholarship to memorialize her work, the Department of Library and Information Science is helping to continue the legacy of Moore, who graduated from Crispus Attucks High School and received her B.S. in sociology and her master’s in library science (M.L.S.) from Indiana University.    We all have a story, and we’re all historically significant.   ## Making history reflect a diverse reality  “Mrs. Moore dedicated her life to building a more inclusive history and we would like to keep her legacy alive by building a more inclusive profession in her honor,” says Andrea Copeland, chair of the Department of Library and Information Science, who collaborated with Moore on archiving projects.  Moore, who died April 18, 2018, worked for 30 years as senior archivist of African-American History at the Indiana History Center. “Your history is who you are,” Moore told The Indianapolis Recorder in 2013, “and when you get to a point where you somehow discount it or not think it’s important, you really diminish yourself.”  [The Indianapolis Recorder](http://www.indianapolisrecorder.com/news/article_476d1100-81c5-11e2-a88b-0019bb2963f4.html)   ## Moore Scholarship Recipients   ## Become part of the solution  By donating to the scholarship established in her honor, you become part of Wilma Moore’s legacy, documenting the history and preserving the heritage of Indiana’s diverse populations.
