    "body": "  ## The legacy of Paul H. O'Neill  Paul H. O’Neill's career is marked by leadership and vision, which he has applied across the public, private, and nonprofit sectors—the same three sectors of the economy we address in our teaching and research.  O’Neill is known for his dedication to public and community service and his strong sense of integrity—occasionally in the face of powerful opposition.  He started his public service career as a computer systems analyst with the U.S. Veterans Administration in the early 1960s. After obtaining his M.P.A. from Indiana University through the federal government’s Education for Public Management program, he returned to Washington, D.C., and worked with the U.S. Office of Management and Budget for 10 years, ultimately serving as deputy director.  In 2001, O’Neill became the 72nd secretary of the treasury. Shortly after 9/11, O’Neill presided over a sudden downturn in U.S. economic growth but restored confidence by vowing to eliminate the funding source of terrorist attacks. He was instrumental in setting up a special task force to combat terrorist financing. O’Neill was an outspoken critic of the complexity of the U.S. tax code and an advocate for policy action on climate change. He resigned in 2002 over major policy differences with President George W. Bush’s administration.  A real leader hungers for the responsibility of making a difference.  O’Neill has served on many boards and is actively involved in influencing public policy, especially as it relates to comprehensive healthcare reform and improving healthcare quality.  In 1997, O’Neill co-founded the Pittsburgh Regional Healthcare Initiative to address the problems of regional health care. In 2005, he founded Value Capture, LLC, where he champions the idea that health care can be improved through the pursuit of perfect safety and clinical outcomes. In 2016, he was appointed to the board of the nation’s premier research hospital, the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center Research Hospital.   ### Life and philanthropy  O’Neill was born into a military family in St. Louis, Missouri. He met his wife, Nancy, at Anchorage High School while living on a military base in Alaska. They have four children, twelve grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.  In 2019, Indiana University named the Paul H. O’Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs in his honor, following a $30 million gift from the O’Neill family to establish new student scholarships, fellowships, faculty positions, and the Paul H. O’Neill Center on Leadership in Public Service, among other initiatives. This follows a previous gift of $3 million from the family to help construct the Paul H. O’Neill Graduate Center on the Bloomington campus in 2017. "

    "body": "  ## Make a difference by protecting your community  If the process of protecting the public fascinates you, the Public Safety Management major will give you a well-rounded understanding of public safety theory and the skills and services used to save lives. As part of your coursework, you ’ ll study a wide range of topics: administration of emergency services, principles of public safety, the art of decision-making, terrorism, financial management, GIS techniques, public policy, and much more. You ’ ll learn from faculty who are studying criminal justice issues relevant to the field of public safety—such as police body-worn cameras—and who have the real-world experience to match. The Public Safety Management major is part of the B.S.C.J. degree.  Description of the video:  “I'm Jennifer Esterline. I'm currently the director of safety and security for the Indiana State Fairgrounds and Event Center. I applied for the internship at the Indiana State Fair as part of my O'Neill program. I was hired about a month into my internship. I was part of rebuilding the safety and security program at the Indiana State Fairgrounds in 2012 after the stage accident and got to do a lot of work with revamping what they had to make it better. We've been able to share what we've learned with events around the country and really around the world. Because what we went through after the stage accident really changed the outdoor event industry. I've been hiring interns for the last nine years. And I would say over 85 to 90% of those are O'Neill students. When we're interviewing interns, we ask a lot of technical questions about public safety and emergencies. And that's where the O'Neill students really shine. When we look at their resumes. They're more involved. They have a well-rounded experience but also a very practical education. And that really sets them apart from other interns that we work with. We're one of the only paid internships in public safety, but that's because we take it very seriously. And for our interns, this is a job. It's not a shadow us and follow us around kind of internship. They're learning dispatch, they're learning hazard assessments, they're learning how to write incident reports, the customer service and guest experience how all that relates back to public safety. They're getting real hands-on experience, that they can translate to any career in public safety.”   ### Find out more about the Public Safety Management major  [Major requirements Learn more about the courses required for the Public Safety Management major.](https://bulletins.iu.edu/iupui/2022-2023/schools/oneill-spea/undergraduate-programs/degrees/bscj-public-safety-mgmt.shtml)   #### Major requirements  Learn more about the courses required for the Public Safety Management major.

However, I love collaborating with students that are proactive, come prepared, and take ownership of their academic and professional career because I have much more to offer my advisees than just answering “tell me what I have left to take.\" Since 2008, I have been working at IUPUI in a variety of areas such as advising, recruitment, student organizations, supervising and training advisors across campus, and teaching. With every opportunity, I educate and encourage students to step out of their comfort zone and embark on experiences that will make them stand out and will help in their academic and professional exploration.   ### Education   ### Professional Experience  Since 2008. I have worked in almost all aspects of higher education, including orientation, peer advising/student positions, recruitment, teaching first year seminars and career courses, advising student organizations, advising all students regardless if they are a transfer, new student, international, or returner. I have also been published and presented nationally on ways to improve advising and the collaboration that we have with our advisees.   ### Selected Intellectual Contributions  [CARLI – Collegiate Advising-Related Learning Inventory](https://ccas.iupui.edu/outcomes-assessment/index.html)  [Elevation through Collaboration: Successful Interventions for Students on Probation](http://www.nacada.ksu.edu/Resources/Academic-Advising-Today/View-Articles/Elevation-through-Collaboration-Successful-Interventions-for-Students-on-Probation.aspx)  ['Approachable' 'Intimidating' 'Unprofessional' 'Credible': What do our offices say about us?](http://www.nacada.ksu.edu/Resources/Clearinghouse/View-Articles/Office-Design-Research-Study.aspx) "

Their research draws on a variety of social science disciplines to investigate criminal behavior as well as evaluate policies and practices aimed at reducing crime and improving the justice system.  The O’Neill School’s faculty research places a strong emphasis on the intersection of social justice and criminal justice. It explores the impact of crime on marginalized and vulnerable populations and examines the ways in which the criminal justice system can work to address systemic issues of inequality and injustice.   ### Related degree programs   #### Bachelor of Science  Criminal Justice   #### Bachelor of Science  Public Safety Management   #### Master of Science  Criminal Justice and Public Safety   #### Master of Public Affairs  Homeland Security and Emergency Management  [Master of Public Affairs-Doctor of Jurisprudence Dual degree offered with the Robert H.

She worked in South Africa during the democratic transition, on the Senate Banking Housing and Urban Aﬀairs Committee as a Congressional Fellow, and for the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Community Development Financial Institutions Fund. Prior to joining the faculty at the school, she spent 10 years on the faculty at George Mason University, where she taught courses on nonproﬁt management, public management, and performance measurement. Her research examines issues of accountability and eﬀectiveness in the nonproﬁt sector. Her current projects explore these issues by looking at the daily work of frontline staﬀ in nonproﬁts and the experience of the people they serve. In this work she seeks to understand how participating in these nonproﬁts aﬀects the health and political eﬃcacy of citizen-clients. Although most of her current research focuses on human service organizations, as an urban planner who has worked in both governmental and grassroots organizations as well as at a policy level, she is also interested in broader community development and governance questions.   ### Education   ### Professional Experience   ### Highlights   ### Selected Intellectual Contributions  [Bringing beneficiaries more centrally into nonprofit education and research](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0899764020918662)  [“Tax Expenditures and Accountability: The case of the ambivalent principals](https://academic.oup.com/jpart/article/28/4/569/5065175)  [“Policy Fields, Data Systems and the Performance of Nonprofit Human Service Organizations](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23303131.2017.1422072)  [“How Civil Society Organizations Foster Insurgent Citizenship: Lessons from the Brazilian Landless Movement](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11266-015-9549-3)  [“Nonprofit Performance: Accounting for the Agency of Clients](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0899764014551987)  [“The Potential of Outcome Measurement for Strengthening Nonprofits' Accountability to Beneficiaries](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0899764012454684)  [“Nonprofits and Outcome Measurement:  From Tracking Program Activities to Focusing on Front Line Work](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1098214012440496)  [“Mediating Accountability: How Nonprofit Funding Intermediaries use Performance Measurement and Why it Matters for Governance](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2753/PMR1530-9576330404#)  [“For the World’s Sake: U.S. Foundations International Grantmaking](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/293166862_For_the_world's_sake_US_Foundations_and_international_grant_making_1990-2002)  Google Scholar  [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=r6QikrEAAAAJ&hl=en) "

O’Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs at IUPUI, starting in January 2021. He received his Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Colorado, where he later completed a postdoctoral fellowship in the Institute of Behavioral Science. His research spans the fields of public policy analysis, environmental politics, and international development, and examines the conditions under which environmental policy reforms and interventions lead to changes in environmental conservation, policy responsiveness, public participation, and human well-being. Much of his current work seeks to understand how policy reforms can alleviate environmental inequalities. To these ends, his work uses a variety of approaches, including quantitative methods, lab-in-the-field experiments, and randomized field trials of interventions. Dr. Cook is currently working with local organizations in India and Nepal on a series of randomized trials and observational studies of environmental policy interventions in those two countries, supported by the National Science Foundation. This project reflects his commitment to working with local stakeholders on both the design and implementation of research.   ### Education   ### Professional Experience   ### Highlights   ### Selected Intellectual Contributions  [Gender Quotas Increase the Equality and Effectiveness of Climate Policy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-019-0438-4)  [Experimental Evidence on Payments for Forest Commons Conservation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-018-0034-z)  Curriculum Vitae  Personal website  [Personal website](https://nathancookphd.com/) "

    "body": "  ## Major in criminal justice and learn to address today’s most complex  issues  With a Criminal Justice major, you’ll get an in-depth look at the policies, procedures, and history behind the U.S. criminal justice system. The Criminal Justice major is part of the B.S.C.J. degree, which will give you an advanced understanding of the techniques used to protect citizens and the community. You’ll take an interdisciplinary mix of courses, such as criminological theory and policies, criminal law, policing, data analysis, courts, and corrections. Plus, you’ll get research opportunities with O’Neill faculty who are examining a wide range of issues, from drug treatments to prison populations, right here in the community.  Description of the video:  Alexander Clausius  \"One of the things that attracted me to the O'Neill School was the slogan 'Major in Making a Difference.' It made sense. You know, why do I want to be a police officer? Why do I want to pursue a career in law enforcement? I want to make a difference in people's lives. The most exciting part is being able to change how people view police officers and law enforcement as an industry. By being a different perspective and a different side of policing. I've been able to set myself up for career goal in the FBI by constantly learning, constantly challenging myself. And I've been given the opportunities and the blessings to do that with the O'Neill School. Coming to Indianapolis was a big move for me. I came because of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety program. And I was also sold on the Indiana University cadet officer program. You get to have experiential activities of going out, seeing what it's like, getting that real-world perspective. I did the cadet duties of building patrols, foot patrols around campus, you know, being the eyes and ears for the agency. And then through that we got to go to the police academy. It's the only police academy in the country that is through a university, and it's a satellite of the Indiana Law Enforcement Academy. You become a fully certified police officer and then you work part time as you finish off your degree. So it sets you up to be an attractive candidate for other law enforcement agencies. If I was to recommend O'Neill to a prospective student, I would say the O'Neill School is a place where you can challenge yourself, no one's gonna deter you. They're just going to tell you here's what we can do to help you succeed.\"   ### Learn more about the Criminal Justice major  [Major requirements Required courses for the Criminal Justice major](https://bulletins.iu.edu/iupui/2022-2023/schools/oneill-spea/undergraduate-programs/degrees/bscj.shtml)   #### Major requirements  Required courses for the Criminal Justice major  [Degree plan Plan your four years at the O'Neill School](https://sisjee.iu.edu/sisigps-prd/web/igps/dm/public/maps/view?mapId=8a44d42e-69a0-4c83-b6d5-32c47f7544d9)   #### Degree plan  Plan your four years at the O'Neill School  [Curriculum A full list of O'Neill course descriptions](https://bulletins.iu.edu/iupui/2022-2023/schools/oneill-spea/courses/index.shtml)   #### Curriculum  A full list of O'Neill course descriptions   ### Credit for law enforcement training  Sworn full-time police officers who have graduated from any of the five Indiana law enforcement academies can earn 12 undergraduate credit hours from the O’Neill School.

Atlas  Senior Lecturer   ### Biography  Prior to joining the O’Neill School in fall 2021, Pierre Atlas was a Professor of Political Science at Marian University and, for 17 years, served as the Founding Director of The Richard G. Lugar Franciscan Center for Global Studies, where he created and directed Marian’s interdisciplinary global studies program and its annual speaker series. At Marian, he taught courses in comparative politics, American politics, international relations, global studies, peace and justice studies, and criminal justice. Dr. Atlas teaches graduate and undergraduate courses in the Public Affairs and Criminal Justice programs for the O’Neill School. A comparative political scientist by training, Dr. Atlas devoted much of his academic career to studying and writing about the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, and other conflicts and conflict resolution. More recently, his comparative research and publications have examined how the legacy of the North American frontier helps to explain contemporary political differences between the United States and Canada on issues such as Indigenous policy, the role of government, and gun laws and gun culture. Dr. Atlas writes a monthly opinion column for the Indianapolis Business Journal and, before that, was an opinion columnist for The Indianapolis Star for 16 years. A native of Texas, he grew up in California and is a U.S. Army veteran.   ### Education   ### Professional Experience   ### Highlights   ### Selected Intellectual Contributions  [American Gun Culture is Based on Frontier Mythology – But Ignores How Common Gun Restrictions were in the Old West](https://theconversation.com/american-gun-culture-is-based-on-frontier-mythology-but-ignores-how-common-gun-restrictions-were-in-the-old-west-184932)  [A Line of Blood and Dirt: Creating the Canada-United States Border across Indigenous Lands](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03612759.2021.1987105?scroll=top&needAccess=true&)  [Sand Creek and the Tragic End of a Lifeway](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/846966)  [Frontier Violence and Law and Order: Historical and Geographical Variance in the Great Plains of the North American West.](https://utpjournals.press/doi/full/10.3138/ijcs.57.x.3)  [Of Peaceable Kingdoms and Lawless Frontiers: Exploring the Relationship between History, Mythology and Gun Culture in the North American West.](https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/USWdBv48q82VChY7b7Q3/full?target=10.1080%2F02722011.2019.1573843&)  [Constructing and Enforcing the ‘Medicine Line’: A Comparative Analysis of Indian Policy on the North American Frontier.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02722011.2016.1214607)  [U.S. Foreign Policy and the Arab Spring: Balancing Values and Interests.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1949-3606.2012.00158.x)  [Conflict among Former Allies after Civil War Settlement: Sudan, Zimbabwe, Chad, and Lebanon.](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022343399036001003) "

It involves the analysis, development, implementation, and evaluation of policies aimed at solving problems that affect the public. Our scholars draw from various disciplines such as economics, political science, sociology, and law to study how policies are formulated, implemented, and the impact they have on society. The field provides valuable insights into how government policies can improve public welfare and promote social justice.   ### Related degree programs   #### Bachelor of Science  Public Policy   #### Master of Public Affairs  Environmental Policy and Sustainability   #### Master of Public Affairs  Policy Analysis   #### Master of Public Affairs  Urban and Regional Governance  [Master of Public Affairs-Doctor of Jurisprudence Dual degree offered with the Robert F.

    "body": "  ## The intersection of theory, learning, and practice: O'Neill Capstone classes  Capstone provides undergraduate and graduate students in their final year with the opportunity to share their expertise with the community by tackling real-world challenges that local organizations face. Students work in teams to analyze data and provide meaningful, implementable recommendations by conducting policy analysis, program evaluations, survey research, data mining, and needs assessments. Undergraduate students who are majoring in criminal justice and public safety management engage in evidence-based practice and research that informs effective policy.   ### Each Capstone group is just four or five students, compared to 40 or more in other programs.   ### Our classes tackle real-life projects, not case studies.  More community involvement   ### Recent Capstone projects   #### Community Connections that Count  Agency: Marion County Commission on Youth  In 2009, the City-County Council of Indianapolis and Marion County selected the Marion County Commission on Youth (MCCOY) to manage its Early Intervention and Prevention (EIP) Initiative, which works to eliminate child abuse, child neglect, and juvenile delinquency.  In 2012, MCCOY engaged a SPEA Capstone class to evaluate the EIP initiative’s effectiveness and provide recommendations for the initiative going forward. The group found that certain strategies have been more successful than others because MCCOY did not have enough resources to accomplish all of its goals, and because participation by community partners had declined since the initiative’s launch.  Capstone students recommended that MCCOY pursue lead partners and encourage them to take greater ownership, increase human resources, maintain and/or strengthen current relationships with participating organizations and individuals, reduce the number of strategies, and increase focus on those maintained. The Capstone group also developed checklists and tools for MCCOY to use in future evaluations.   #### Riders in the Know/Drivers in the Know  Agency: Bicycle Indiana and INDYCOG  Capstone students assessed how much bicyclists and motorists know about safe bicycling practices. Students surveyed cyclists and drivers, analyzed the results, and produced recommendations for a bicycle safety education campaign.   #### Ransom Place Revitalization Team  Agency: Ransom Place Neighborhood Association  The Ransom Place Neighborhood Association engaged students to help revitalize the historic neighborhood near the IUPUI campus. After conducting research, students developed three recommendations.  The first was to become more involved in residents’ issues, by assisting with maintenance and landlord issues, joining the Indianapolis Neighborhood Resource Center, and developing a website.  Second, Capstone students advised the RPNA to work more closely with Indianapolis city departments and local organizations.  Third, the RPNA could improve neighborhood cohesion by including residents on its board, integrating the student and non-student populations, participating in an annual service project, and leveraging student technological expertise to document the neighborhood’s history.   #### IUPUI Parking and Transportation Services Project  Agency: IUPUI Parking and Transportation Services  In an effort to reduce single-occupancy vehicle use on campus, IUPUI Parking and Transportation Services asked the Capstone group to assess transportation alternatives for IUPUI students, staff and faculty.  The group reviewed IUPUI’s Master Plan, surveyed the campus population to determine transportation needs, completed both transit and land use analyses, assessed transportation alternatives, and made recommendations. Those included an automated people mover, carpooling, transit use, and bicycle use. The group also suggested ways to fund and expand those options.   #### Data Compilation for Workforce Development  ﻿Agency: ﻿EmployIndy  EmployIndy, Marion County’s workforce development organization, needed a way to share data. Students evaluated how other workforce development organizations compile and use data, determined best practices, and developed a digital dashboard. The Capstone group also suggested using an outside organization to create and maintain that digital dashboard, and recommended that it incorporate data from STATS Indiana, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Census Bureau.   #### Cultural Connections  ﻿Agency: ﻿Indianapolis Cultural Trail  The Indianapolis Cultural Trail wanted to determine the trail’s economic impact. Capstone group research determined that the Cultural Trail has a positive economic impact on the City of Indianapolis ranging from $567,284 to $6,182,776. The group further recommended that Indianapolis Cultural Trail develop a trail counting program, expand directional signage to the trail, and educate the public on its connectivity.   #### Expanding Student Entrepreneurship at IUPUI  ﻿Agency: ﻿IUPUI  IUPUI asked students to analyze entrepreneurship support services at the university. The Capstone group found that IUPUI offers these services, but support is weak. Students recommended that the campus develop a co-working space dedicated to entrepreneurship and providing services including access to technology, coaching/mentoring, access to funding, and research tools. The class also supplied the university with a five-year implementation plan.   ### Social dreamers. Tangible skill sets.

With a major in Sustainable Management and Policy, you ’ ll learn how to develop and implement policies that help communities meet the needs of the present without compromising the future. The major is part of the B.S.P.A. degree, which will give you the flexibility of working in the public, private, or nonprofit sector. The major will give you a strong public affairs foundation so that you have a practical understanding of economics, policy analysis, management, and urban policy.

Description of the video:  “Sustainability is finding a way to meet the needs of now without compromising our future. And the program at O'Neill teaches you how to make that real sustainable change on a nonprofit, public, or private level. I am an intern for the Office of Sustainability at IUPUI. And it has just been one of the most impactful things that I've ever done, I get to work on projects that create real sustainable change on campus. With Indianapolis being the capital, there's just an immense amount of opportunities for internships or future jobs. I like to say that I started my career, the minute I started university. And not a lot of people can say that. I came to college to really push myself and learn new skills. And I really feel like O'Neill has a really strong quality of what they're doing and what they teach. I am very passionate about environmental justice. O'Neill taught me what it looks like to take a really big idea and then how to narrow it down and say, 'These are the steps that you take.' And I really, really value a faculty member who comes in and shares real-world experiences about what it's like to implement a program. And it takes a little bit of what we learn in the classroom and applies it to real life. With one of my O'Neill classes, every week before we start, we all stand up and share something about our week. Everyone has their own little things that they care about, but collectively as a whole, we're all making this really big difference.”   ### Find out more about the Sustainability Practice and Policy major  [Major requirements Learn more about the courses required for the Sustainability Practice and Policy major.](https://bulletins.iu.edu/iupui/2022-2023/schools/oneill-spea/undergraduate-programs/degrees/bspa-sust-prct-policy.shtml)   #### Major requirements  Learn more about the courses required for the Sustainability Practice and Policy major.

At the O’Neill School, we encourage education about and awareness of how others think, live, and express themselves. Our faculty and staff members are committed to developing students who are well-educated, innovative, and engaged residents and leaders who embrace the many dimensions of diversity.  We recognize that Black lives matter; that no person should live in fear, regardless of ethnicity, religious practice, or immigration status; that women should be part of the decision-making process in all areas of society; that every person has the right to express who they are and love whom they choose; and that a person's abilities should never limit what they can accomplish.

    "body": "  ## Earn a Master of Science in Criminal Justice and Public Safety  The Master of Science in Criminal Justice and Public Safety (MSCJPS) is a 36 credit hour graduate degree that prepares students with the analytic skills, theoretical understanding, empirical knowledge, and practical applications related to the law enforcement, courts, correctional, and private security environments.  The MSCJPS program enables students to gain advanced research skills needed to prepare them for careers as criminal justice practitioners, as well as continuing their education in doctoral programs in criminology and/or criminal justice. The MSCJPS program also offers a thesis option for students seeking advanced research careers or a doctoral degree.  The MSCJPS leverages the expertise of the O’Neill School faculty that are actively engaged in research with local and national organizations, the urban location of the university, established partnerships with the community and local criminal justice organizations, and the social, demographic and economic trends that are attracting greater numbers of students to study, live, and work in metropolitan areas.   ### The criminal justice field is continually evolving  New criminal justice-focused organizations are emerging at a rapid pace. Traditional police and correctional agencies are becoming more reliant on personnel with critical thinking, discretionary, and evidence-based problem solving skills. Moreover, organizations that deliver community supervision, diversion, and social services are becoming more prevalent and in demand of persons with education in the varying fields of criminal justice.  The MSCJPS curriculum not only positions student for success in these fields, but also provides a gateway for students to pursue further graduate education in the social sciences.   ### Degree requirements  Completing the MSCJPS requires 24 core hours in criminal justice and public safety systems and law, planning and management, theory, risk analysis, and research methods. Students also choose 12 credit hours in either criminal justice or public safety, with a required 3 credit hour internship or service credit counting toward this requirement.   ### Pursue a master’s thesis  The MSCJPS program also offers a thesis option for students seeking advanced research careers or a doctoral degree.  MSCJPS grad student Katie Heinz analyzed the toxicology reports of nearly 1,200 overdose victims in Marion County and compared that data with records from the Marion County Jail and Indianapolis Emergency Medical Services (EMS) to identify intervention points for treatment.

The IU Public Policy Institute was created in 1992 by Indiana University as a multidisciplinary institute within the Paul H. O’Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs. Staffed by a team of researchers and faculty members from the O’Neill School, the Public Policy Institute delivers unbiased research and data-driven, objective, expert analysis to help public, private, and nonprofit sectors make important decisions that directly impact quality of life in Indiana and throughout the nation.  Whether it’s analyzing the financial needs for water and wastewater infrastructure in Indiana, or evaluating the effectiveness of behavioral health courts, the Public Policy Institute provides the knowledge, data, and analysis that organizations need to make sound decisions, without political agenda or ideological bias.  While we develop policies that address the problems Hoosiers face, many of those same policies and solutions can be applied in other parts of the country that face similar challenges.   ### Public Policy Institute research areas  [Criminal justice The institute has established itself as a reliable resource for the study of the state’s corrections, courts, defense, and prosecution and sentencing systems.](http://policyinstitute.iu.edu/research-area/details/3)   #### Criminal justice  The institute has established itself as a reliable resource for the study of the state’s corrections, courts, defense, and prosecution and sentencing systems.
