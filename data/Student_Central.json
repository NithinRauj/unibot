Not paying your fees does not automatically cancel your registration, you must drop your classes or officially withdraw to avoid being charged.  The IU Board of Trustees approves all fees, usually in May or June of each year. The Board of Trustees reserves the right to change fees without notice. Indiana University recently restructured fees to make them clear and simple to help students and their families better anticipate and budget.  For many students, fees that varied greatly semester to semester will now be distributed more evenly over the course of their education. Some fees were eliminated, and others were consolidated or renamed. In some cases, the dollar amount of the fee decreased ​. There are several broad categories of fees that may apply to you.  The master fee list contains all possible fees. Choose your options to find fees that will apply to you.    [Visit the master fee list](https://ubur.sitehost.iu.edu/) "

    "body": "  ## Get a fresh start through academic renewal  This is an update to the policy formerly known as Grade Forgiveness.  If your first attempt at your undergraduate degree from IU was not as successful as you might have hoped, Fresh Start through Academic Renewal offers a second chance.  You may apply for Fresh Start if:  The Fresh Start through Academic Renewal policy allows you to start over with a  GPA of 0.00.  For any courses in which you previously received a P, S, or a C or better, the credit hours will count toward your degree but won't be factored into your GPA.  All IUPUI undergraduate, degree-seeking students who meet the criteria, regardless of the unit of enrollment, are eligible to apply.  Application for Fresh Start must be made by the last day of classes in the second term of enrollment after returning from hiatus.  If you're interested in Fresh Start, talk with your academic advisor or school for details.   ### The fine print  You can request Fresh Start only once. However, taking advantage of this doesn’t keep you from using other available course-specific grade replacement options after you start taking classes again.  You must complete a minimum of 30 hours on the IUPUI campus after your return in order to meet the graduation residency requirement.  Fresh Start is available for courses taken at any Indiana University campus and may be applicable to certain Purdue enrollment.  A note about Financial Aid : Fresh Start may have impact on Federal Aid eligibility, but it does not replace such processes as appeals for Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP). If you have applied or will apply for Federal Student Aid, please see information about separate SAP processes .  [SAP processes](https://studentcentral.iupui.edu/funding/manage-financial-aid/satisfactory-academic-progress.html)  For more information about Fresh Start through Academic Renewal at IUPUI, read the IUPUI Faculty Council's policies and resolutions .

There are two types of Federal Direct Loans: subsidized and unsubsidized.   #### Subsidized loans  Direct Subsidized Loans are available to undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need. If you get a Direct Subsidized Loan, the U.S. Department of Education pays any interest that accrues while you’re enrolled at least half time.   #### Unsubsidized loans  Direct Unsubsidized Loans are available to both undergraduate and graduate students. You do not need to show financial need to qualify. You’re responsible for paying all interest on the loan.  [Learn more differences](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/loans/subsidized-unsubsidized#subsidized-vs-unsubsidized)   ### Next steps  If you’re a first-time borrower, you must sign an online Master Promissory Note (MPN) agreeing to the loan terms. You’ll also need to complete entrance counseling to help you understand the loans you’re borrowing and the options you’ll have to repay them.   ### Repaying Federal Direct Loans  You’ll begin repaying your loans six months after you graduate or drop below half-time status. First, you’ll be asked to complete exit counseling, which will provide you with information on repaying your loans. We’ll send you email with the details when it’s time for you to go through exit counseling.   ### Apply for a Federal Direct Loan  To be considered for Federal Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans, all you have to do is complete your FAFSA.

    "body": "  ## What to know about withdrawing from IUPUI  Failure to pay your bursar bill doesn’t withdraw you from IUPUI. If you don’t withdraw properly, you risk receiving grades of F in your courses. You’ll also be responsible for all course fees, plus any applicable late fees, through the time you officially withdraw.  If you decide not to attend, you must follow the procedures on this page.   ### Drop all of your classes  What happens when you cancel your registration depends on whether or not it’s after the first week of the term.   #### Through the first week of the term  You can withdraw from IU without penalty during the first week of the semester. Cancel your registration by dropping all of your classes . After you drop all classes, print a copy of your class schedule to make sure all classes were dropped   #### After the first week of the term  If you withdraw after the first week of classes, the classes in which you were enrolled will appear on your record with a grade of W or F as appropriate and a note with the date you withdrew.   ### Cancel your housing contract and meal plan  Canceling your registration doesn’t cancel your housing contract or meal plans. If you live in campus housing, you’ll need to cancel your contract by emailing reslife@iupui.edu from your university email account.  [Learn more about housing contracts](http://housing.iupui.edu/preparing/My%20Contract%20Process/faqs.shtml)  If you have a required meal plan, it will be cancelled automatically when you cancel your housing contract.  [Learn more about meal plans](https://mealplans.iupui.edu/faq.aspx)   ### Monitor your student account  If you owe a balance on your student account, pay it by the due date. Past due balances will keep you from obtaining a transcript or registering at any IU campus.  Continue to monitor your student account and your IU email account for a few months after you withdraw to make sure all account adjustments have been made.  It can take up to 30 days for your student account to be finalized and a refund issued (if you’re due one).  While a grade of W doesn’t affect your GPA, keep in mind that a pattern of withdrawals may raise concerns about a lack of satisfactory progress toward your degree.   ### When you withdraw matters  What approvals you need and what your grade will be depend on when you withdraw.  This information applies to standard 16-week terms and 6-week summer session classes. For classes less than 16 weeks long or summer session classes greater or less than 6 weeks long, contact the Office of the Registrar for signature requirements and deadlines.   #### Before the first day of classes   #### First week of classes (fall/spring)   #### First week of classes (summer)   #### Second through ninth week of classes (fall/spring) or second and third weeks (summer)  You can use eDrop/eAdd or obtain a drop/add form from your advisor or school, get the required signatures, and submit the completed form to the Office of the Registrar .  [eDrop/eAdd](https://one.iu.edu/task/iu/edrop-eadd)   #### Tenth week through the official last day of classes (fall/spring) or fourth through sixth week (summer)  You should drop classes at this point only under exceptional, extenuating circumstances.   ### Withdrawing due to an emergency  You may need to withdraw from IUPUI due to an unexpected event such as a major medical issue, death in the family, job loss, or divorce. In cases such as these, contact IUPUI Student Advocacy for assistance.

If you withdraw from IUPUI after your aid has been applied, the federal government requires us to calculate whether your aid must be repaid. We may return all or some of the money already applied to your student account. The amount that will be repaid will depend on when you withdraw and what charges are on your student account.   #### Your Frank O’Bannon and 21st Century Scholars awards will be affected  If you officially withdraw from a semester or drop below full-time enrollment before the state census date (end of the 25% refund period or 28th day of the term), the state requires that your O’Bannon and 21st Century Scholars awards be cancelled. If your state aid is cancelled, you will receive a notification at your university email address. You can also view your financial aid online .  [view your financial aid online](https://one.iu.edu/task/iu/view-my-financial-aid)   #### You may have to repay some money  About 45 days after you withdraw, we’ll send you a letter that lists the aid we’ve returned to federal Title IV programs on your behalf.  If you received federal aid funds directly (for example, as a refund to be used for other educational expenses), you might have to return some of that money.  We’ll bill you for any IU charges that remain unpaid.   #### You may not be eligible for future aid  If you withdraw from IU, your eligibility to receive aid in the future may be affected.

Your timing makes all the difference when it comes to whether or not you’re hit with extra fees or a bad grade. Your status as an undergraduate, graduate, or professional student will also determine the steps you take and the potential effect of a change in your schedule.  Dropping or adding classes can affect your financial aid , scholarship status, or tuition cost. If you do decide to drop or add a class, be sure to talk with your academic advisor or faculty chair first. If you’re worried about what will happen with your finances, contact the Office of Student Financial Services .  You are responsible for taking the appropriate steps outlined on this page to officially add or drop a class. Failure to do so may cause you to get an F in a course you didn’t attend—or not get credit for a course you did attend. Keep in mind that not attending a class or not paying for a class will not result in you being automatically dropped.   ### Drop all your classes  If you want to drop all your classes, you’ll need to withdraw from the university.   ### Making changes during the self-service drop/add period  Self-service drop/add is available from your initial registration through the first week of classes in fall and spring terms or the end of the third day of each major summer session. If you drop a class during this time, it won’t show up on your transcript. So if you want to avoid a W (Withdrawn) grade, make sure to drop during the drop/add period .

All awards you received in a prior term will be taken into account to make sure you don’t exceed the maximum allowed by federal law.  We’ll use the most recent information available regarding funds you received at your previous school to figure your eligibility. If that information is later updated with additional awards you received, your IUPUI financial aid may be reduced.

If you don’t receive a work-study job or you want to earn more, you can always apply for non-work-study positions.  You can find work-study positions as well as other jobs through Handshake.

If not, contact the Office of Student Financial Services to find out if you’re eligible—and be sure to let us know if you have received a job offer.  The next step is to connect your Federal Work-Study award to your job. Make sure you include your employer’s name and your supervisor’s contact information.

However, it is possible to make adjustments after your loans have been awarded.   ### Reduce your debt by reducing your loan amount  Remember that you’ll be offered the maximum amount you’re eligible to borrow. Once you see your account charges or get your refund, you might decide you don’t need to borrow that much money. You can minimize your loan debt by reducing a loan or canceling it completely.   ### How to cancel or reduce your loans after they’re applied  After your loans are applied to your student account, you’ll get an email message about your right to cancel or reduce your loans. You have 14 days from the date on the message to complete the loan cancellation/reduction request form. If you don’t want to cancel or reduce a loan, just ignore the message.  You may use the loan cancellation/reduction request form to request a change to a federal student loan only if you’re the borrower. For example, a parent may not adjust a Federal Direct Loan on which their student is listed as the borrower. If you are not the borrower, your request will be denied.  [loan cancellation/reduction request form](https://one.iu.edu/task/iu/loan-cancellation-reduction-request-form)  You must submit the form no later than 14 days from the date on the notification email or letter stating that loans have been applied to your student account. Requests to cancel or reduce loans after 14 days will be denied.   #### Important information about canceling or reducing loans  If you get a refund before we receive your loan adjustment request, we’ll let you know how much you need to repay to IU, how to pay, and the deadline by which you need to pay. If a cancellation or reduction leaves an outstanding balance in your student account, you must use personal funds to pay the balance in full by the due date. Failing to do so will result in late payment fees and other institutional penalties.  We’ll process your request in a timely manner, and requests may not be reversed once processed. We may adjust your request if all or part of your loan has already been credited or refunded.  Unsubsidized loans will be reduced or cancelled before subsidized loans.  Cancelling the first loan disbursement will automatically cancel the second disbursement.

    "body": "  ## You’ve filed your FAFSA—now what?  To make sure you get your financial aid on time, you’ll want to follow the steps on this page after filing your FAFSA each year. Making sure you check off these tasks will help ensure your success at IUPUI.   ### Check your FAFSA  Review the status of your FAFSA 3–5 days after you submit it. Make any necessary corrections as soon as possible to make sure your financial aid is processed quickly and accurately.  Be sure to avoid these common mistakes:  Your FAFSA will be processed with the information you provide, so make sure everything is correct.  In some cases, you may need to make specific changes to your FAFSA to meet eligibility requirements for awards from the state. Check ScholarTrack for details.  [ScholarTrack](https://scholartrack.che.in.gov/)   ### Verify your information  You may be asked to verify the information you provided on your FAFSA before you can be declared eligible to receive financial aid. If you’re selected for verification, we’ll contact you by email and your To Do List to tell you what you need to do.  [To Do List](https://one.iu.edu/task/iu/view-my-to-do-list)  The most common verification tasks are submitting a tax return transcript or a verification of nonfiling form.  [tax return transcript](https://www.irs.gov/Individuals/Get-Transcript)  Be sure to complete verification as quickly as you can and turn in all required documents at the same time to avoid delays with your financial aid. We’ll process your file within three weeks after we have all of your documentation.  Don’t wait too long. If you submit your documentation at the end of the semester, there is no guarantee that your verification will be completed before the last day of classes. This could affect your financial aid eligibility, and we may be required to cancel any existing awards you received.   ### Check your email  Email is our primary way of communicating with you. Make a habit of checking your university email on a regular basis—if you miss a crucial message, it could delay your aid.   ### Check on your financial aid package  Once your eligibility has been reviewed, you’ll get a financial aid notification (FAN). Take time to review your FAN with your family. It gives the details about your financial eligibility, expected costs, and other important information.  Get familiar with your aid package and your cost of attendance (COA) . If you receive more funding after your award package has been put together, and that funding causes your aid total to exceed your COA, your award package may change. In some cases, your aid can change even if it doesn’t exceed your COA.   ### Take care of your To Do List  Monitor your To Do List regularly to keep track of issues related to your financial aid. Anything that shows up on your list must be completed in order for you to receive your awards. Be sure to check the list regularly and turn in all requested documents as soon as possible—most forms take at least 10 business days to process.  [To Do List](https://one.iu.edu/task/iu/view-my-to-do-list)   ### Accept, reduce, or decline funding  Grants and scholarships are automatically accepted on your behalf since they represent money that you don’t have to earn or pay back. You must manually accept, reduce, or decline all other awards—otherwise, they won’t be applied to your bursar bill.   ### Sign the paperwork  If you accept part or all of a Federal Direct Loan, you’ll need to go through entrance counseling and sign a master promissory note (MPN).   ### Authorize IUPUI to use your aid  Signing a Title IV authorization allows your Title IV financial aid such as Federal Pell Grants and Federal Direct Loans to go toward charges other than tuition and fees (for example, your parking permit or meal plan). We strongly recommend that you complete this authorization.   ### Sign up for direct deposit  If your financial aid is greater than your bursar bill, you’ll be sent a refund for the difference. With direct deposit, you’ll get that money faster.   ### Grant third-party user access  If you want to let a parent, spouse, sponsor, or other person to be able to check on your financial aid, you can grant them access.   ### Start your financial wellness journey  IU’s MoneySmarts website helps you protect yourself from debt. See how much college will cost with the online calculator, read up on your credit score, check out money podcasts, and much, much more.  You can also take online courses through MoneySmarts U to learn about money at every stage of your college career. You’ll discover how to sort through credit card offers, plan for living expenses, decide what to do with work income, and figure out how to prepare for your financial future.

Keep in mind that, depending on your choices, you may have additional charges for program fees , housing , recreational center , meal plans , and parking .

Learn more about it.   ### Calculate Your Costs   #### Crunch the numbers and find out how much it's going to cost.  [Visit MoneySmarts](https://moneysmarts.iu.edu/calculate-costs/index.html)   ### Basic Information  Fees are additional charges to cover the costs of certain services, such as technology or labs.  Indiana University recently restructured fees to make them clear and simple to help students and their families better anticipate and budget.  For many students, fees that varied greatly semester to semester will now be distributed more evenly over the course of their education. Some fees were eliminated, and others were consolidated or renamed. In some cases, the dollar amount of the fee decreased ​.     ### Frequently Asked Questions  What are fees, and why are they necessary? Fees are additional charges to cover the costs of certain services, such as technology or labs. By keeping these costs separate from tuition, some charges can be more directly assigned to the students using the services.  I don’t use the services described in a fee often or at all. Why am I assigned the fee? ​ Fees that cover the cost of some widely used services are assigned to all or most students; for example, access to software. While all students are encouraged to take advantage of the benefits these fees provide, we understand that not every student will use the services each semester of their program. ​  IU recently made changes with how fees are assigned. Will all students pay less in fees because of the changes? ​  As a result of the new fee structure, most IU students will pay less in fees over the course of their degree program, with $14.5 million in overall savings to the student body as a whole, beginning in the 2023-24 academic year.  Some students may see only minimal decreases or the same level of fees, with even fewer seeing an increase in fees, depending on their degree program. ​  ​ How does the fee restructuring impact the cost of tuition?  Tuition and fees are distinct from one another, with separate processes that determine how they are set.  Are tuition rates being adjusted?  The IU Board of Trustees approved an annual tuition increase of 3% over the next two years for undergraduate resident (in-state) students at all IU campuses. The proposed increase — which remains below average inflation and lower than Indiana Commission for Higher Education guidance — will support faculty recruitment and retention while addressing increases in expenses for labor, services, and other fixed costs. ​  What is IU doing to make higher education more affordable? ​  According to the latest available comparative data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, the net cost of attendance at IUPUI is among the lowest in comparison to other four-year institutions in Indiana.  In the past eight years, IU has increased institutional aid by 57 percent to help make our degrees more accessible through initiatives such as MoneySmarts , which have served as a statewide and national model for easing the burden of loan debt on students and their families. Resources are detailed on a dedicated website on affordability . ​  [MoneySmarts](https://moneysmarts.iu.edu/)  [dedicated website on affordability](https://affordability.iu.edu/)  As a result of these efforts and others, more than half of this year’s undergraduates left IU’s campuses with zero debt.   ### Find out how where you live affects how much you pay  [Learn about reduced costs for non residents](https://admissions.iupui.edu/cost-aid/msep/index.html) "

    "body": "  ## How to get verification of your IUPUI enrollment  At some point, you may need an enrollment verification certificate to prove your current or past enrollment status as an IUPUI student.  Beginning the second week of the term, once enrollment is official, you can obtain an enrollment verification certificate.  Good student verifications will be available approximately three weeks after a term ends.  [Obtain your enrollment verification certificate](https://transcript.iu.edu/verification/index.html)   ### What does an enrollment verification include?  When a third party requires an enrollment verification, they usually just need confirmation of your current enrollment, your enrollment status, and your expected graduation date. Good student discounts through your insurance company are based on your grades and GPA. Other discounts may be based on conferral of your degree. You’ll have the option to request any available information you want to provide to the third party.   ### About your enrollment status  Verification of your enrollment status is based on the number of hours you’re enrolled in a term. Full-time enrollment is often required for you to be covered by insurance. At least half-time enrollment is often needed to to defer loan payments. Make sure you consider all possible consequences before you drop below full-time status.   #### Undergraduate enrollment  If you’re working on an undergraduate degree that requires at least 120 credit hours, you should plan to complete 15–16 hours per semester in order to graduate in eight semesters.   #### Graduate enrollment  For graduate students enrolled under the quarter calendar:  For some graduate students, typically those doing dissertation work, fewer hours may be required to maintain full-time status.   #### Enrollment for GI Bill recipients  To receive the most out of your education benefits from the Federal Veterans Administration, recipients must maintain full time status.  Because each student's schedule may vary, you are encouraged to contact the Office for Veterans and Military Personnel once you have enrolled in your courses for guidance.

    "body": "  ## Want to know your grade point average?  You can calculate your expected GPA before semester grades are officially released. All you need to know is:   ### Calculate your semester GPA  Your semester GPA is calculated by dividing your credit points by your credit hours.  Your semester GPA: 3.00 .   ### Calculate your overall GPA  Your overall GPA is calculated by dividing your cumulative course hours by your cumulative points. Enter your prior course hours and points. Your current semester hours, points, and GPA will be included automatically.  Your cumulative GPA: 3.00 .   ### What is—and isn’t—included in your GPA calculation  Only courses with grades of A+ through F are used in calculating your GPA.  If you’re pursuing a Purdue degree at IUPUI, your GPA will be calculated following Purdue’s grading policy . Courses taken at any IU or Purdue campus and included in your program of study will be used to calculate your final GPA when you’ve earned your degree. This degree GPA will appear on your IU transcript only upon completion of your degree.  [Purdue’s grading policy](http://www.purdue.edu/registrar/faculty/grading/grading-systems.html)  Courses taken at non-IU institutions are not used in calculating your IU GPA.  If you’re enrolled at more than one IU campus during your academic career, your cumulative GPA will be for all of your IU coursework, not separated by campus.  If you pursue both an undergraduate degree and a graduate degree at IU, your undergraduate and graduate GPAs are calculated separately.  Note that your GPA on your official transcript will be carried to the fourth decimal place and then rounded. For example, a calculated value of 3.9793 would be rounded to 3.979, while a calculated value of 3.9795 would be rounded up to 3.980.   ### How your degree GPA compares to your university GPA  In some cases, schools calculate a degree GPA which varies slightly from your cumulative GPA as it appears on your transcript. This is due to differences in program requirements and occurs most often in Purdue degree programs. Check with your school recorder for more information.   ### Find out more about grades at IUPUI "

You can take advantage of this grade replacement policy if:  If you choose to take a course a second time, you must notify your school that you want to have your first grade replaced prior to graduation. Replacement doesn’t happen automatically.  Contact your academic advisor to review your best grading options in regard to your academic success.  [academic advisor](https://one.iu.edu/launch-task/iu/student-appointment-scheduler)   ### The fine print  Grade replacement is available only for courses taken at Indiana University. You can use grade replacement for a maximum of 15 credit hours, subject to approval by your school. You can request a grade replacement no more than twice for a single course, and each attempt counts toward your 15-credit limit.  To use grade replacement, the repeated course grade should be the same as or higher than your previous attempt at the course. A student must receive a letter grade upon retake in order to change the previous grade. Any replaced grades will be excluded from your GPA, and the credit hours from the original course will not be counted.  For grade replacement applied to courses taken between 1996 and summer 2021: the replaced grade remains on the student's academic record with an X placed next to the original grade.  For grade replacement applied to courses taken during fall 2021 and beyond: the replaced grade will appear on your academic record as an X.  Students may replace the grade in any course unless the faculty of a unit will not allow students to replace grades in courses required for a major, minor, certificate, honors program, or other recognition by the unit. The course that the student retakes should be the same course as the previous one, but need not be offered by the same instructor. A student may grade replace an Honors course (or a course taken under an Honors contract) with a non-Honors course.  However, once the X'd grade is applied, the original course will no longer count towards Honors program requirements.  Grade replacement is not an option if the original grade was assigned as a result of the student's academic misconduct. Once a grade replacement has been put on your record, it can’t be reversed.   ### Get more information about grades  [Read IUPUI's replacement policy](https://facultycouncil.iupui.edu/Governance/Policies-Resolutions) "

Interest does not accrue while you are enrolled at least half time and during deferment and grace periods.  After you stop attending school at least half time, your nine-month grace period will begin. If you re-enroll as a nursing student during the grace period and are approved for an in-school deferment, you’ll get another nine-month grace period the next time you stop attending school at least half time. If you re-enroll again, you are not eligible for another grace period.   ### Loan repayment  You’ll be required to go through exit counseling when you’re scheduled to graduate from IUPUI or drop below half time. An exit interview is your opportunity to review the amount of your loans and rights and responsibilities in repaying these loans.  Repayment begins when your grace period ends. The maximum repayment period is 10 years, and you’ll be expected to make regular payments. The minimum monthly payment is $40, but may be higher depending on your balance.  You may prepay your loan at any time without penalty. This may reduce your interest costs significantly.   ### Looking for a loan?

    "body": "  ## Review the federal regulations on the return of financial aid  If you withdraw or leave school, federal regulations determine what financial aid, if any, you may be able to keep.   ### Summary of regulations   #### Summary of Sec. 668.21  Treatment of Title IV funds when a student withdraws, drops out, or is expelled before the first day of class  If a student officially withdraws, drops out, or is expelled before the first day of class of a payment period, all funds paid to the student for that payment period for institutional or non-institutional cost under the Federal Pell Grant, FSEOG (Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant), and Federal Perkins programs are an overpayment. If an institution is unable to document the student's attendance during the payment period, the student meets the drop out definition.  The institution is required to return the overpayment to the respective Title IV or Higher Education Act (HEA) programs in the amount that the student received in each program.   #### Summary of Sec. 668.22 Treatment of Title IV funds when a student withdraws   ##### General information  When a student who is a recipient of Title IV loan or grant assistance withdraws during a payment period or period of enrollment in which the student began attendance, the institution must determine the amount of Title IV grant or loan assistance earned as of the student's withdrawal date.  If the total amount of Title IV grants or loans, or both, that the student earned is less than the amount of Title IV grants that was disbursed to the student or on behalf of the student in the case of a parent PLUS loan as of the date of the institution's determination when the student withdrew, the difference must be returned to the Title IV program. No additional disbursements may be made to the student for the payment period or period of enrollment.  If the total amount of Title IV grants or loans, or both, that the student earned is greater than the total amount of the Title IV grants or loans disburse to the student or on behalf of the student in the case of a parent PLUS loan as of the date of the institution's determination when the student withdrew, the difference between these amounts must be treated as a post-withdrawal disbursement.  A post-withdrawal disbursement must be made from available grant funds before available loan funds. If outstanding charges exist, the institution may credit the student's account up to the amount of outstanding charges with all or a portion of any post-disbursement grant funds. Post-disbursement loan funds to pay outstanding charges require the confirmation of the student or parent for a parent PLUS loan.  The institution must notify the student and parent in the case of the parent PLUS loan within 30 days of the institution's determination that the student withdrew to offer to disburse any grant or loan funds directly to the student or parent in the case of a parent PLUS loan that is not credited to the student's account. The funds may be accepted or declined. The parent or student has 14 days from the date of notification being sent to respond. With a timely notification from the student or parent in the case of a PLUS loan to confirm a post-withdrawal disbursement, the institution must disburse the funds within 120 days of the institution's determination that the student withdrew. For a late response from the student or parent in the case of a PLUS loan, the institution may make or decline to make the post-withdrawal disbursement.   #### Title IV grant or loan assistance definition  The following programs are defined as Title IV grant or loan assistance:  Federal SEOG (Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant) programs, not including the non-Federal share of FSEOG awards if an institution meets its FSEOG matching share.   #### Withdrawal date  The withdrawal date for a student who withdraws from an institution that is not required to take attendance (e.g., IUPUI) is the earlier date of:  At IUPUI, the office designated for a student notification to withdraw is the Office of the Registrar .   #### Percentage of payment period completed  Calculate by dividing the total number of calendar days in the payment period into the number of calendar days completed as of the student's withdrawal date.   #### Calculation of Title IV assistance earned by the student  The percentage of Title IV assistance earned is equal to the percentage of the payment period completed as of the withdrawal date. If the withdrawal date occurs after the 60 percent point, then the percentage of Title IV assistance earned is 100 percent. This percentage is then applied to the total amount of Title IV grant and loan assistance that was disbursed (and that could have been disbursed) to the student, or on the student's behalf in the case of a parent PLUS loan, for the payment period for which it was awarded.   #### Calculation of Title IV assistance unearned to be returned  The unearned amount of Title IV assistance to be returned is calculated by subtracting the amount of Title IV assistance earned by the student from the amount of Title IV aid that was disbursed to the student or on behalf of the student in the case of a parent PLUS loan.   #### Responsibility of the institution for return of unearned aid  The institution must return the lesser of the calculated total amount of unearned Title IV assistance or an amount equal to the total institutional charges the student incurs for the payment period multiplied by the percentage of awarded Title IV grant and loan assistance that has not been earned by the student.   #### Institutional charges  Institutional charges are tuition, fees, room and board (if the students contracts with the institution for room and board), and other educationally-related expenses assessed by the institution.   #### Responsibility of the student for return of unearned aid  The student returns unearned Title IV assistance minus the amount the institution returns. Any Title IV loan program is returned in accordance with the terms of the loan and any Title IV grant program as an overpayment of the grant. However, a student is not required to return the portion of a grant overpayment amount that is equal to or less than 50 percent of the total grant assistance that was disbursed for a payment period or a grant overpayment amount of 50 dollars or less that is not a remaining balance.   #### Repayment of the overpayment by the student and Title IV eligibility  A student who owes an overpayment remains eligible for Title IV and HEA program funds through the earliest of 45 days from the institutional notification of the overpayment or 45 days from the date the institution was required to notify the student of the overpayment if, during the 45 days, the student repays the overpayment in full to the institution or enters into a repayment agreement that is satisfactory with the institution with a maximum payment in full within two years.   #### Student notification for repayment  The institution must notify a student within 30 days of the institution's determination that the student withdrew and owes a Title IV or HEA overpayment in order to recover the overpayment. The notification provides the student with terms to permit the student to repay the overpayment while maintaining Title IV and HEA program funds with repayment of the full amount of the overpayment within two years of the date of the institution's determination the student withdrew.   #### Loss of Title IV eligibility  In the context of Return of Title IV funds, a student is no longer eligible if they do not enter into a repayment agreement with the 45 day period or fails to meet the terms of the repayment agreement.   #### Order of return of Title IV funds  Unearned funds returned by the institution or student are credited to outstanding Title IV loan balances made to the student or on behalf of the student for the payment period. Excess funds must be credited to outstanding balances in the following order:  If unearned funds remain to be returned after repayment of all outstanding loan amounts, the remaining excess must be credited to any amount awarded in the payment period to grant programs in the following order:   #### Timeframe for the return of Title IV funds by the institution  An institution must return the funds for which it is responsible as soon as possible but no later than 45 days after the date of its determination that the student withdrew. An institution must determine the withdrawal date for a student that does not provide notification to the institution no later than 30 days after the end of the earlier of the payment period or period of enrollment.   ### Learn more about financial aid "

    "body": "  ## Dropping or adding classes after the first week of the semester  The late drop/add period starts after the first week of classes and lasts through the automatic withdrawal (automatic W) period . To add or drop classes during this time, use eDrop/eAdd . You can track the progress of your drop/add requests via the View SIS eDocs task in One.IU.  [eDrop/eAdd](https://one.iu.edu/task/iu/edrop-eadd)  [View SIS eDocs](https://one.iu.edu/launch-task/iu/view-sis-edocs)  If you’re a University College student or a freshman in the School of Engineering and Technology, you must see your advisor to initiate a late drop.  If your eDrop/eAdd request is not approved within 14 days, the request will be canceled.   ### Adding classes  All late add requests require the approval of an academic advisor. If the class has started, the instructor’s approval is also required. It is at the discretion of the instructor and advisor to approve or deny a late add request.  If you submit an eAdd request, your request will automatically be sent to the appropriate approvers.  If your request is approved, your class schedule will be updated and you’ll receive an email notifying you that your request was completed. Until you receive this email confirmation, you’re not officially added to the class. However, you may attend that class while you wait for approvals.   ### Dropping classes during the automatic W period  All drop requests require the approval of an academic advisor.  If your request is approved, your class schedule will be updated and you’ll receive an email notifying you that your request was completed. You’ll remain enrolled in the class until you get this email confirmation.  You’ll get a W (withdrawn) on your transcript for any class you drop. While a grade of W doesn’t affect your GPA, be aware that a pattern of withdrawals may raise concerns about a lack of satisfactory progress toward your degree. If such a determination is made, your school may prevent you from registering and you may risk restrictions or loss of financial aid.   ### Dropping or adding classes after the automatic W deadline  After the automatic W deadline , you’ll need approval from your advisor, instructor, and school’s dean.  Many schools require additional information before they’ll consider a drop this late in the semester. These requests are considered only in extraordinary circumstances beyond your control and are rarely granted.  Poor performance in a course is not considered grounds for a late drop. If a late withdrawal is granted, you’ll receive a grade of W if your work is of passing quality at the time of your withdrawal or an F if it isn’t.  If you’re worried about your GPA, talk with your instructor to see if there are better options available, such as seeking an Incomplete .  No drop requests will be processed once grade rosters are open for a term. You may need to pursue a retroactive withdrawal request by following the grade change appeal process .  If a certain enrollment status (e.g., full- or part-time) is required for reasons such as visa status or to receive VA benefits, make sure you know how a drop might affect your eligibility.   ### Keep these tips in mind before submitting an eDrop, eAdd, or both   #### Wait for confirmation  Submitting a request is not a confirmation that the course has been dropped or added. After the appropriate advisor, instructor, and/or dean approves your request, you’ll get an email confirming that your request was approved and your schedule has changed. It’s your responsibility to monitor the status of your request.  Any request that hasn’t been approved or denied two weeks after you submit it will be automatically canceled.   #### Know how your student account will be affected  Additional tuition charges may apply when you change your schedule. Be sure to talk to the Office of Student Financial Services and the Office of the Bursar to understand any effects on your financial aid or fees.  If you’re an undergraduate, dropping classes that put you below 12 credit hours or adding classes that put you above 18 credit hours can have a major effect on the amount you pay for the semester.  If you’re a graduate or professional student, be sure you understand your individual program tuition and fee rates.  In extenuating circumstances, you may wish to pursue a tuition dispute . Contact the Office of the Bursar for more details.     #### What to know about eDrop/eAdd pair  Dropping and adding a class at the same time is called an eDrop/eAdd pair.  If you drop and add a class in the same transaction, both requests must be approved before any changes to your schedule are affective. If your drop request is approved but your add request is not (or the other way around), your schedule remains unchanged.  The drop/add together option is designed this way to ensure your enrollment status doesn't change. If you’re not worried about maintaining full-time status, consider submitting separate drop and add requests instead.   ### Explore refunds and tuition disputes "

    "body": "  ## Make a scholarship payment  Unless you specify otherwise, all scholarships are posted as general awards. They’re payable toward all charges on a student’s account, and any remainder is eligible for refund to the student after all charges have been paid.  Due to the volume of scholarships we receive, we can’t guarantee full compliance with any donor limitations placed on scholarship funds. Additionally, funds cannot be restricted to paying specific fees.  This page contains what you need to know about how—and when—to make scholarship payments for a student.   ### Paying tuition and fees only?  Use the sponsorship instructions instead.   ### How to make a scholarship payment  You may pay an IUPUI student’s scholarship by check or electronic funds transfer. (Scholarship checks for a student attending another IU campus should be mailed to the campus where the student is enrolled.)  Be sure to send the following information along with your check or in an email to finaid@iupui.edu when funds are transmitted:  Please contact the Office of Student Financial Services at finaid@iupui.edu with questions or to request this form in an accessible format.   #### Send a check  Scholarship checks should be made payable to Indiana University and mailed to:  Include the student’s name and university ID on the memo line. Please do not include the student as a co-payee as this will delay processing.  Your canceled scholarship check serves as your receipt. We strongly recommend that you do not send checks by certified mail.   #### Transfer funds electronically  Indiana University accepts electronic fund transfers for student scholarship payments. Requests should be made by the donor and not the student. Contact the Office of the Treasurer at treasury@iu.edu for information on how to submit scholarship payments by ACH or EFT.   ### When to pay  Please note that we will not bill you for scholarship payments. If you require an invoice or bill, the student must provide you with a copy of their bursar account statement.  We recommend that you submit your payment early enough for scholarships to credit to a student’s account before their charges are due. Students may accrue late fees if we don’t receive your scholarship payment prior to the student’s bursar bill date.   #### Receiving a refund  If a student you’re paying a scholarship for withdraws from IUPUI after receiving an award, it’s your responsibility to collect from them any scholarship funds that were disbursed. However, if the student withdraws before receiving the award, we’ll refund undisbursed funds directly to you.  Undisbursed scholarships are generally reviewed and refunded to donors during the second week of each semester. You (or the student) may email finaid@iupui.edu to request that funds be returned to you prior to this period. Be sure to include the reason why you’re requesting a refund.  The initial refund process may take up to ten business days to complete. Refund checks will be issued by IU Financial Management Services and can take up to six weeks to reach you.   #### How to get more information about a scholarship recipient  Although we will confirm a student’s enrollment at your request in order to facilitate a scholarship payment, we are unable to monitor a student’s continued enrollment or academic progress. You should contact the student directly to get the following information:  For other student information, including official university documentation of financial aid information, contact the Office of Student Scholarships prior to the semester’s recommended payment date. The student must have an authorization to release confidential information on file with us before we can fulfill your request.   ### Just paying tuition and mandatory fees? "

    "body": "  ## Learn how to register for classes  When your enrollment date and time comes, you’ll use the Student Center in One.IU to register for classes. In the meantime, read and follow the instructions on this page to make sure you’re prepared.  [Student Center](https://one.iu.edu/task/iu/student-center)   ### When to register  You may register at any time after your scheduled enrollment date and time through the first week of classes.  Keep in mind that the earlier you register, the more likely you are to get into the classes you want. You are not allowed to have someone else register you for your classes.   #### Currently enrolled students  If you’re a currently enrolled IUPUI student, you should register during priority registration. You’ll automatically be given a date and time to begin registering for the next term, and you’ll be notified via email when your enrollment day and time have been assigned. At that time, you can also check your enrollment dates in the Student Center .  [Student Center](https://one.iu.edu/task/iu/student-center)   #### New students  If you’re a newly admitted student, you’ll register during open registration.  For undergraduates, this typically occurs during Orientation .  For graduate/professional students, your program may offer a new student orientation and the IUPUI Graduate Office offers an online orientation that you can access any time of day.  [Orientation](https://orientation.iupui.edu/)  [online orientation](https://graduate.iupui.edu/support/orientation.html)   #### Returning students  If you previously attended IUPUI but are not enrolled in the current term and wish to enroll, contact the Office of the Registrar prior to the beginning of priority registration to confirm your registration eligibility.   #### Temporary intercampus transfer students  If you’re enrolled on another IU campus and want to take a class at IUPUI, you’ll need to apply first.  [Review the eligibility requirements](https://admissions.iupui.edu/apply/transfer/nondegree-and-visiting/temporary.html)   #### Permanent intercampus transfer students  If you were last enrolled on another IU campus but did not graduate, you’ll need to transfer to IUPUI before you can register.   ### Before you register  Check out this list of tasks you must complete before your enrollment date.   #### Check your enrollment date and time  Look in the Student Center to verify your enrollment date and time. This is not an in-person appointment—it’s the date and time you may begin registering through the Student Center.  [Student Center](https://one.iu.edu/task/iu/student-center)   #### Decide what classes to take  Review the schedule of classes before registration starts. Make sure you know the academic requirements of your degree program.  Meet with your academic advisor and get a list of recommended courses, along with some alternative options (just in case).  [Schedule an appointment with your academic advisor](https://one.iu.edu/task/iu/student-appointment-scheduler)   #### Be sure nothing will restrict your registration  Certain courses, such as those marked PERM (permission) or RSTR (restricted), must be approved by the department or school offering the course before you register.  Be sure there are no academic or financial holds that will prevent you from registering.   #### Plan your class schedule in advance  You can use the Shopping Cart to build and save your schedule before your registration appointment. You can also use iGPS to plan your schedule.  [Shopping Cart](https://one.iu.edu/task/iu/view-enrollment-shopping-cart)  [iGPS](https://one.iu.edu/task/iu/igps-plan)   #### Check your credit hour load  In the fall and spring, you can enroll in up to 18 credits hours each semester.  And remember that undergraduate students pay the same flat tuition rate when enrolling in 12-18 hours.  If you wish to enroll for a higher number of credits, you need to obtain signatures from your advisor and the dean of your school. It’s your responsibility to provide this written permission to the Office of the Registrar .  Please see the diagram below for information on summer credit hour limits.    The summer session has a maximum credit hour limit of 18 credit hours. The first summer session and second summer session have a maximum credit hour limit of 9 credits per session. As the first and second summer sessions rest within the larger full summer session, a class taken as a full summer session class would have its credit hours count toward the maximum for both the first and second summer sessions.   ### It’s registration time!  Be sure to have your university ID handy when you’re ready to register.   #### Priority registration  Your enrollment date occurs during priority registration. You’re advised to register as close to your enrollment date as possible.   #### Open registration  You may register any time after your enrollment date until registration ends immediately preceding the first day of classes. This is the open registration period.   #### Late registration  Late registration runs from the first day of classes through the end of the first week of the semester. Learn more about late registration .

If you’re transferring to IUPUI or also taking classes at Ivy Tech , you’ll need to take a few extra steps.  [Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)](https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa)   ### Your application starts with the FAFSA  Be sure to submit a FAFSA each year to be considered for federal and state aid. We use your FAFSA to determine your eligibility, calculate your need, award your financial aid, and prepare your financial aid notification (FAN) .  [financial aid notification (FAN)](https://one.iu.edu/task/iu/view-my-financial-aid)   #### When to submit your FAFSA  The FAFSA typically becomes available October 1 of each year, and you should submit by the priority deadline of April 15. By meeting this deadline, you’ll have the most opportunities to receive funding.  For the 2024-2025 FAFSA, we are waiting to hear when the FAFSA will be available.  The Department of Education said it will be available by December 31, 2023.  The priority deadline will remain April 15th.   #### What you’ll need  Make sure you have the important pieces of information listed here. Having everything together before you start will make filling out the FAFSA easier.   ##### Your FSA ID  To file your FAFSA, you (and one of your parents, if you are a dependent) need to create a Federal Student Aid (FSA) ID . This is a username and password combination that you’ll use to securely access your financial aid information and electronically sign your FAFSA.  [Federal Student Aid (FSA) ID](https://fsaid.ed.gov/npas/index.htm)  [Learn more about your FSA ID](https://fsaid.ed.gov/npas/pub/faq.htm)   ##### IUPUI’s federal school code  IUPUI’s federal school code is 001813.   ##### Tax information  You’ll need your tax information from two years before the academic year for which you’re seeking aid.

    "body": "  ## How to pay your bill  You have several options when it comes to paying your IUPUI bursar bill. So you can avoid potentially long lines, we encourage you to pay online, by mail, or by using the Office of Student Financial Services secure drop box .  Make sure you make your payment at least five business days prior to the due date —or sooner, depending on your payment method—to help ensure that your bill is paid on time.   ### Need help?  Check out IT Training’s student bursar account tutorials.  [Find a tutorial](https://ittraining.iu.edu/sis/student_self_service_information/)   ### Pay online with IU Bursar Pay  You can pay your bill online via credit or debit card, or via electronic check (e-check). (Note that you’ll be charged a convenience fee of 2.85 percent (subject to change) if you use your credit or debit card, but not if you pay by e-check.)  If you’d like to let a parent or other person have access to pay your bursar bill, you’ll need to grant them third-party access . Remember that you are ultimately responsible for the timely payment of your bill.  Payments are processed through a secure payment system. IUPUI staff do not have access to your confidential banking information.  [Pay online now](https://one.iu.edu/launch-task/iu/view-bursar-balance?terms=bursar)  [Log in to pay as a third party](https://one.iu.edu/launch-task/iu/3rd-party-user-access)   ### Pay your bill with a payment plan  IU partners with NelNet Campus Commerce to let you pay your balance over time with a payment plan. This option allows you to pay off your account in up to four payments over the term, depending on when you enroll in the payment plan.  If you cannot pay all at once, you can use payment plans to budget your payments into smaller installments throughout the term. Here is what you need to know:  Fall 2023 payment plan schedule (Semester students):  Fall 2023 payment plan schedule (Quarter Students):    Spring 2024 payment plans will become available in December 2023.   ### Pay with electronic transfer (international payments)  If you’re an international student, you can pay in your own currency by using  Flywire, PayMyTuition, or Convera. The exchange rate is competitive and there’s no transaction fee for IUPUI students (though your bank may charge a fee). Both services are more convenient and cost less than wires directly from your bank to IU.  Make sure you follow all directions for whichever payment processor you choose. We’ll post the U.S. dollar equivalent to your student account, usually within five business days after your local bank transfers the money. Make sure you start the process with plenty of time before your bill is due.

This can be an employer, government agency, vocational rehabilitation, military branch, foreign government, trust, or other funding source.   ### Pay with a 529 college savings plan  A 529 plan, also called a qualified tuition program, is designed to help families set aside money for college. Every state and many financial and educational institutions have 529 plans.  [Learn more about 529 plans](https://529.iu.edu/)   ### Indiana’s CollegeChoice 529 plan  If you are an account owner for a CollegeChoice 529 plan, you have four options for making a payment:  [distribution request form](https://www.collegechoiceadvisor529.com/home/manage-accounts/forms.html)  [Submit a distribution request online.](https://www.collegechoiceadvisor529.com/inatpl/acctmaint/acctList.do)  [CollegeChoice](https://www.collegechoiceadvisor529.com/home/manage-accounts/contact-us.html)  The first three options allow your payment to be made to you as the account owner, to the beneficiary, or to the school. The fourth option allows payment to the account owner only, unless a prior payment has been made to the school.  Once you’ve made a request, it takes approximately 15 days to receive the check, so plan accordingly. Make sure the student’s name and 10-digit university ID number are included in the memo section of the check. Mail checks to IUPUI’s lockbox address .   ### Other 529 plans  Payments from 529 plans other than Indiana’s CollegeChoice , Ohio’s CollegeAdvantage , and the Kentucky Education Savings Plan Trust require specific information from IUPUI. Please contact your plan’s administrator for additional information.  [Indiana’s CollegeChoice](https://www.collegechoiceadvisor529.com)  [Ohio’s CollegeAdvantage](https://www.collegeadvantage.com/)  [Kentucky Education Savings Plan Trust](https://www.kysaves.com/)   ### Pay  through U.S. Mail  If you want to mail your payment, you must print a copy of your bill and mail it along with your check or money order to IUPUI’s lockbox address:  IUPUI Lockbox Payment Processing Center P.O. Box 7245 Indianapolis, IN 46207-7245  Make your check, money order or cashiers check payable to Indiana University. Checks and money orders must be payable in U.S. dollars and drawn on a U.S. bank.  Postdated checks, counter checks, and two-party checks (those made payable to a person, company, or institution other than Indiana University) are not accepted. Additionally, personal business checks may be returned if the account indicates to send guaranteed funds.  Any credit balance from a check payment will not be refunded until 14 calendar days from the date the payment posts to your bursar account.  Your canceled check serves as your receipt. We recommend that you do not send checks by certified mail.   ### Pay in person  All payments must be in U.S. currency. We accept, money order, cashiers check, personal checks and cash in person.  Make in-person payments at the Office of Student Financial Services during regular business hours.  For your convenience, you can deposit your check in the drop box in the second-floor north hallway outside Student Financial Services. Make sure your name and university ID number are on your check. Do not place cash or signed traveler’s checks in the drop box.  Checks presented in person with our representatives at Student Financial Services or placed in the lobby drop box may be converted into an electronic payment format.   ### Problems with your payment  Make sure you pay on time and that you have sufficient funds to cover your bill to avoid these potential pitfalls.   #### Returned checks  If your bank returns a nonnegotiable check or electronic payment, you’ll be assessed a nonrefundable service charge. You may also be barred from enrolling at IUPUI.  The current service charge is $27.50. If your bank returns two or more nonnegotiable payments, you may not be able to pay with a check in the future.   #### Late payments  Your student account will be charged a late payment fee of 1.5 percent each month that it’s past due. Late fees are costly, and you can avoid them easily by paying the amount due or enrolling in the payment plan by the due date.   ### Make sure you pay your bill on time "

Vouchers submitted after the fourth full week of a term may be declined.  We’ll credit the student’s account within 48 hours after we receive a voucher, and we’ll send you an invoice after the term’s refund periods end. The invoice will be due in full within 30 days.  If you don’t pay in full by the due date, we’ll contact you to determine why payment has been delayed. If you neither pay nor respond, we’ll contact the student at their university email address to request that they follow up with you. In most cases, a delay in payment is due to a sponsor needing additional information from the student.  We reserve the right to decline further vouchers from you if you do not pay.   ##### Submit a voucher  [Submit a voucher here](https://one.iu.edu/task/iu/sponsor-voucherauthorization-for-outside-sponsor)   ### Are you paying a student’s scholarship?

[start the certification process](http://veterans.iupui.edu/benefits/#apply)  During the early stages of the certification process, you may receive a letter stating you won’t receive any funds from the Post-9/11 GI Bill for the academic term you specified. Don’t be alarmed by this message. To ensure that students have ample time to adjust their schedules early in the term, OVMP initially reports only basic enrollment level information to the VA. This ensures that benefit payments are requested only for well-established course schedules.   #### About your estimated credit  After OVMP has processed your request for enrollment certification, they’ll provide your information to the IUPUI Office of the Bursar, who will place an estimated Post-9/11 GI Bill credit on your account. This credit serves as a placeholder for the payment the Veterans Administration (VA) will eventually disburse to the university.  The Office of the Bursar uses the estimated credit to ensure that you’re not penalized for outstanding balances that will likely be satisfied by your Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. The estimated credit process also ensures that any refundable items such as Pell Grants or student loans are disbursed to you in a timely manner.  In most cases, the estimated credit on your account will mirror the payment received from the VA. However, if the estimated credit doesn’t match the payment exactly, the adjustment may create a new balance on your account. In the event that an adjustment is made, the university will contact you via email.   ##### Situations that can cause discrepancies between estimated credit and actual payment  The most common issues that require a credit adjustment are:  [Learn more about the Post-9/11 GI Bill](https://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/post911_gibill.asp) "

    "body": "  ## The basics of repaying loans  When you’ll start repaying loans depends on the type of loan you choose. Some require you to start paying them back while you’re still in school, while others start after you graduate. But all loans must be repaid.  Don’t be fooled by federal maximum loan amounts. Those are the maximum limits for all borrowers and aren’t related to your own personal earning potential. The maximum amount you’re eligible to borrow may be more than you’re able to repay. If you aren’t able to repay your education loans, you could seriously damage your credit rating. That could make it hard to get other types of consumer loans.   ### Mind your interest  On Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans and Federal Direct PLUS Loans , the government starts charging interest as soon as we receive the loan funds. You can pay the interest while in school or capitalize it (have it added to the principal) and begin repaying it after you graduate.  Paying the interest while in school will help you reduce your payments later. When interest is capitalized, the loan principal increases—which means that each time interest is figured, it’s figured on a larger amount.  View current interest rates for borrowing a Federal Direct loans  [View current interest rates for borrowing a Federal Direct loans](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/interest-rates)   ### Loan exit counseling  When you’re about to graduate, or if you drop below half-time enrollment, you’ll be asked to complete loan exit counseling for your Federal Direct Loans. Exit counseling will give you the information you need to know about repaying your federal student loans. The exit counseling process for Federal Direct Loans is different from other student loans such as a Health Professions Loan or a Federal Nursing Loan.  No matter what kind of loan you have, we’ll send you email to let you know how to get started with your exit counseling.  [Learn more about exit counseling](https://studentaid.gov/exit-counseling/)   ### Consolidate your loans  If you’re having difficulty making your current federal student loan payments, you have other repayment plan alternatives. Contact your loan servicer for details.  If you have more than one federal student loan, you may be able to consolidate them into a single loan with one monthly payment. This payment can be quite a bit lower than your total monthly payments on multiple loans.   #### Pros and cons of consolidation   ##### Pros   #### Cons  [Learn more about consolidation](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/consolidation)   ### Don’t default on your loans  If you don’t pay back a loan according to the terms of the Master Promissory Note (MPN) you signed, you may default on the loan. Default occurs if you don’t pay on time or if you don’t comply with other terms of your MPN.   #### What happens if you default?

This might be a result of:  [See your account balance](https://one.iu.edu/task/iu/view-bursar-balance)   ### IU Online students  If you’re taking online courses and currently reside in a state other than Indiana, email iuonline@iu.edu for state-specific online course refund policies.   ### Getting your refund  If you end up with a credit balance, you’ll be issued a refund. It’s usually processed within five business days after the credit is posted to your student account.  When you receive a refund will depend on whether you’ve set up direct deposit or will be receiving a check. (Credit card payments that result in a credit balance will be refunded to the credit card, and should appear within ten business days.)   #### Get your refund via direct deposit  With direct deposit, your refund will be deposited straight into your checking or savings account. You’ll get your money faster than if you wait for a check—usually within three business days after the processing date shown on your account.  [Set up direct deposit](https://one.iu.edu/task/iu/direct-deposit-of-bursar-refunds)  [Watch a direct deposit tutorial](https://iu.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/Setting+up+Direct+Deposit+for+your+bursar+refunds/1_16xpmqlj)   #### Get a refund check in the mail  If you haven’t signed up for direct deposit, we’ll mail your check to your local address —so make sure you keep your address current. Mailed checks will usually arrive within 7–10 business days after the processing date shown on your account. If you don’t receive your refund check within 10 business days, you should issue a stop payment request so your refund can be re-sent to you.   ### How—and when—refunds are processed  Financial aid is normally credited to your account 10 days before the first day of classes, and we’ll process those refunds the same day. After this initial process is complete, refunds will be processed every Friday.  Exceptions will be handled on a case-by-case basis.   ### How dropping courses affects your student account  If you drop a course, you may be eligible for a refund of tuition and fees. The refund amount you’ll receive depends on the length of the course and when you drop it. Be sure to check the official calendar for the deadlines for each refund amount.  If dropping a course results in a financial aid refund, the Office of Student Financial Services may need to determine whether the refund is appropriate or if your aid must be adjusted for compliance reasons.   ### Learn more about how dropping classes affects you "

    "body": "  ## Don’t lose your aid  You’ve met the eligibility requirements . You’ve completed your FAFSA . And your financial aid has been credited to your account. Now what?   ### Maintain your enrollment  Any change to your enrollment may result in a change to your financial aid eligibility. This includes:  If any of these occur, you may be asked to return money you’ve already received, and may not receive money you’re expecting.  For most types of financial aid, you need to be enrolled at least half time during any semester you’re receiving aid:  Note that waitlist hours aren’t counted when determining enrollment status—only classes you’re actually registered for will count.   ### Exceptions to the half-time rule   #### Federal Pell Grants  The amount of your Pell grant is determined by your enrollment status at the end of the 100% tuition refund period , so be sure to finalize your schedule before the end of this period.   #### Frank O’Bannon Grants  If you’re receiving a Frank O’Bannon Grant , you’re required to be enrolled in at least 12 credit hours through the 25% tuition refund period . If you were enrolled in 12 credit hours and received your award, then dropped below 12 credit hours, the grant will be removed from your account. This may create a balance on your bursar account that must be repaid.   #### 21st Century Scholarship  If you’re receiving a 21st Century Scholarship , you’re required to be enrolled in at least 12 credit hours through the 25% tuition refund period . If you were enrolled in 12 credit hours and received your award, then dropped below 12 credit hours, the grant will be removed from your account. This may create a balance on your bursar account that must be repaid.   ### How withdrawing from courses affects your aid  Withdrawing from all of your courses during a semester can have a big impact on your financial aid.   #### Return of Title IV funds  If you receive Title IV financial aid and officially withdraw from a semester or unofficially withdraw by ceasing to attend, federal regulations require a Return of Title IV Funds calculation to determine if any Federal Title IV aid must be repaid. Federal Title IV aid includes Pell Grants,  Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants, Direct Loans, Perkins Loans, and PLUS loans for parents or graduate students.   ####   #### Repayment calculations  The amount of Federal Title IV aid to be repaid is calculated based on the percentage of time completed within a semester. This involves calculating the amount of Title IV aid that you earned, and the amount of institutional charges for that semester. Prior to withdrawing for the semester, you are encouraged to contact our office .  When unearned Federal Title IV funds are repaid, they are returned by program up to the disbursed amount for each program. Unearned Federal Title IV grant funds are returned prior to loan funds in the following order: Direct Unsubsidized Loans, Direct Subsidized Loans, Perkins Loans, Direct PLUS loans for parents or graduate students, Pell Grants, and Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants.   #### Notification of return of funds  If funds are returned, you will be notified by mail no later than 45 days of the determination that you withdrew during the semester. In the case of a Parent PLUS loan, notification regarding the loan will be sent to the Parent PLUS loan borrower. Your notification will provide detailed information on the Federal Title IV funds and the amount of these funds to be repaid by the student and/or parent. If the notification to the student and/or parent includes eligibility for a post-withdrawal disbursement, the student and/or parent has 14 days to respond to accept or decline. The return of these funds typically results in charges becoming due which previously were paid by the aid we are required to return. Current information on your financial aid award status and bursar account status is available on One.IU .  [One.IU](https://one.iu.edu/task/iu/student-center)   #### Withdrawals and state of Indiana awards  If you officially withdraw from a semester or drop below full-time enrollment (12 credit hours) before the state census date (end of the 25%  refund period or 28th day of the term), state regulations require the cancellation of Frank O'Bannon and 21 st Century Scholars awards. This cancellation results in the removal of the financial aid credit from your bursar account, and the charge is your responsibility to repay. If your state aid is cancelled, you will receive a  Financial Aid Notification (FAN) at your university email address with an update. FAN emails are sent daily. You are also encouraged to visit One.IU to view your financial aid award  status and bursar account status.  [One.IU](https://one.iu.edu/task/iu/student-center)   #### Withdrawals and academic progress  Withdrawal from the semester after the official census date may impact future eligibility for federal or state financial aid due to Satisfactory Academic Progress . Future satisfactory academic progress monitoring will include any courses dropped after the official census date as attempted but not completed hours.   #### How repeating courses affects your aid  If you repeat a course more than once in which you received a letter grade of D– or higher, federal regulations say that repeated course can’t be included in your enrollment status when we calculate your federal financial aid eligibility.  If you’re enrolled in 12 credit hours during which you repeat a previously passed 3 credit hour course for the second time, only nine of your credit hours can be used to calculate your financial aid eligibility. Your enrollment will be reported as three-quarter time rather than full time, which may affect your federal grants and loans.   ### Learn more about financial aid "

    "body": "  ## Find funding for your education  You have a lot of options when it comes to finding financial aid to help you attend IUPUI. Before you borrow money, make sure you understand the types of aid that are available.   ### Scholarships  Depending on your academic achievement or financial need, you may qualify for one or more scholarships. Scholarships are known as “gift aid” and don’t have to be paid back.   ### Grants  If you have financial need, you may qualify for one or more grants. Grants are known as “gift aid” and don’t have to be paid back.   ### Loans  You can apply to borrow money from the U.S. government or from private lenders. Loans must be paid back with interest, usually after you finish your education—even if you don’t complete your degree.   ### Work-study  Work-study is earned as wages through a part-time job, usually on or near campus.   ### Ready to get started?

    "body": "  ## Get credit without affecting your GPA  Do you want to take an interesting, unfamiliar, or challenging course, but are worried about how it might affect your GPA? You can take up to eight electives as pass/fail during your undergraduate career.  If you receive a grade of D– or above, you’ll get credit hours for the course and a grade of P on your academic record, and your GPA won’t reflect the grade. But keep in mind that if you receive an F, that F will appear on your transcript and be calculated into your GPA.  Courses taken as pass/fail count toward your full- or part-time standing for purposes of financial aid or loan deferments.   ### How to take a class as pass/fail  If you want to take a class as pass/fail, you’ll need to get a pass/fail option form from your school recorder. Fill out the form, get the required signatures from your advisor and dean, and return the form to the Office of the Registrar by the pass/fail deadline .  If you’re an undergraduate student, your instructor won’t know you’re taking their course as pass/fail. However, graduate students will need to get the instructor’s signature on the pass/fail form.   ### Requirements and restrictions  Every degree program has different requirements for taking the pass/fail option—check your school’s academic bulletin or contact your school recorder for details. Some schools allow fewer than eight pass/fail classes or have other restrictions. Note that after you’ve invoked the pass/fail option, you can’t change back to a letter grade for the course.  [academic bulletin](http://bulletin.iupui.edu/)   ### Pass/fail versus satisfactory/fail  Certain courses are taught on a satisfactory/fail (S/F) basis. Everyone in the course receives either an S or F, and you don’t have the option of receiving a letter grade. Courses that are graded as S/F generally include that information in the schedule of classes .  Like the pass/fail option, a grade of S isn’t calculated in your GPA, while a grade of F is.   ### Find other ways to take classes "

All you need to do is submit your FAFSA each year.  IUPUI receives a certain amount of SEOG funds each year from the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Federal Student Aid. Once the full amount of IUPUI’s SEOG funds has been awarded to students, no more SEOG awards can be made for that year.  If you may be eligible for a SEOG, you should submit your FAFSA as early as possible each year for a greater chance of receiving SEOG funds.

We’ve made it easy by breaking costs down for you with our standard cost of attendance (COA) estimate.   ### About these numbers  Your cost of attendance may differ from these estimates and will not be what you will owe the university. Our Net Price Calculator can help you estimate your financial aid awards and your costs. Based on your enrollment, IUPUI will bill you each semester for tuition, fees, and housing (if applicable) not already covered by your financial aid. Visit the Student Center in One.IU for your specific billing information.  [Student Center](https://one.iu.edu/task/iu/view-bursar-balance)  We’re showing you the COA for a full academic year (fall and spring semesters). Cut these numbers in half to figure out the cost of a single semester. Tuition and fees outlined here are based on 12 to 18 credits per semester.

    "body": "  ## How to request a grade change  If you believe there’s been an error in the calculation or assignment of a grade, it’s your responsibility to contact your instructor. The instructor can request for your grade to be changed if there’s an error.  If you can’t resolve the matter with your instructor or you’re unable to contact them, talk to the chair or director of the department or program in which the course was offered to learn more about the grade change appeal process. Required steps—including deadlines and timelines—may vary.   ### The grade change appeal process  You can resolve grade change requests, grade discrepancies, or grade disputes through the submission of a grade change appeal after the course concludes.  You’re able to submit an appeal only if you took the course within the last five years. (Academic units may choose to enforce shorter time periods.) Exceptions to this five-year period are extremely rare.  If you’re an undergraduate student, you can submit a grade change appeal . The completed appeal will go to the Office of the Registrar, who will distribute the form(s) to the appropriate academic unit(s). Please contact the Office of the Registrar at 317-274-1519 or iupuireg@iupui.edu with questions or to request this form in an accessible format.  If you’re a graduate or professional student, requests are subject to the policies of the academic unit offering the course. Contact them directly for details.  Grade change decisions are made by the academic unit offering the course. If your request is approved, the school will notify the Office of the Registrar to update your record. If your request is denied, the school will notify you directly. Please allow four weeks for the review process to be completed.  Grade change appeals for courses older than five years will not be considered.   ### Requests for withdrawal after a course concludes  Schools cannot consider a retroactive withdrawal request if you’ve completed the course.  Failure to withdraw yourself from a course, even if you’ve never attended, isn’t sufficient reason for the course to be deleted from your record.  IUPUI will consider deleting a course from your record only in cases where the university has made an error. This is also true for grades of W.  For more information about grade and withdrawal policies at IUPUI, read the IUPUI Faculty Council’s policies and resolutions .

We’ve made it easy by breaking costs down for you with our standard cost of attendance (COA) estimate.   ### About these numbers  Your cost of attendance may differ from these estimates and will not be what you will owe the university. Our Net Price Calculator can help you estimate your financial aid awards and your costs. Based on your enrollment, IUPUI will bill you each semester for tuition, fees, and housing (if applicable) not already covered by your financial aid. Visit the Student Center in One.IU for your specific billing information.  [Student Center](https://one.iu.edu/task/iu/view-bursar-balance)  We’re showing you the COA for a full academic year (fall and spring semesters). Cut these numbers in half to figure out the cost of a single semester. Tuition and fees outlined here are based on 12 to 18 credits per semester.  Your actual costs for room and board, books and supplies, transportation, and personal expenses will vary based on:   ### COA estimates for the 2021-22 academic year  Total  $24,168  $25,756  $17,286  If you’re from Michigan or a Midwest Student Exchange Program state , your estimated cost may be less than that of an out-of-state student from a different state.

Note that if you’re attending less than half time , your COA will include only:   #### Tuition and fees  Tuition and fees are based on full-time enrollment for fall and spring semesters. However, your actual tuition and fees will be based on the number of credits you enroll in for each semester.   #### Books and supplies  Books and supplies are estimated based on an average cost for textbooks and related supplies for a full-time student.   #### Room and board  Room and board costs are estimated based on the housing option you reported on your FAFSA .   #### Transportation  Transportation is estimated based on data from the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics.   #### Personal  Personal costs are miscellaneous costs estimated based on clothing, recreation, medical and dental costs, life insurance, and health insurance.   ### Explore tuition and fees at IUPUI "

First, check with your instructors to find out if you can schedule a make-up exam. If not, do the following:  Or, if you choose, you can take all finals as they are scheduled.   ### Final exam conflicts  The final exam schedule exists to limit potential conflicts in your exam schedule.

If an instructor changes an exam time and that creates a conflict for you, you should first talk with your instructor.  If you’re unable to resolve the problem with your instructor, report the change to the instructor’s department chair. If it still isn’t resolved, contact the chair’s dean or director. If you’ve tried all of these avenues with no success, contact the Office of Academic Affairs .  [Office of Academic Affairs](https://academicaffairs.iupui.edu/)  An instructor giving a final exam before the final exam period should be reported in the same way.   ### When are your final exams?

    "body": "  ## Information for Ivy Tech students  If you’re an undergraduate taking classes at certain Ivy Tech campuses and also at IUPUI or IUPUC, you may be able to receive financial aid to assist with the costs of attending both schools.  We maintain two financial assistance agreements with Ivy Tech:  [Ivy Tech Central Indiana](https://www.ivytech.edu/central-indiana/)  [Ivy Tech Columbus](https://www.ivytech.edu/columbus/)  Your financial aid will be determined based on your overall enrollment at both schools. Additionally, only classes that will apply to your degree objective will be included when we determine your financial aid eligibility.  Classes taken at any other Ivy Tech campuses (including online classes through another Ivy Tech campus) are not included in either of these agreements.   ### What to do if you're taking classes at Ivy Tech and IUPUI or IUPUC  Note that there are special requirements for CVO awards .   #### Your home school  Your home school is the school where you’re enrolled in a degree program and from where you’ll earn your degree. Your home school will also process, monitor, and disburse your financial aid.   #### Your host school  Your host school is the school you’re visiting to complete part of your degree program requirements. Your host school will not process financial aid for the semester specified on your agreement.   ### Why do I need to complete a financial assistance agreement form?  Federal regulations state that you can receive financial aid for any given enrollment period only at the school where you’re seeking a degree. This means that you can’t receive aid at both schools during the same semester. You must complete the form each semester to avoid overpayment of financial aid funds—and to keep from having to untangle a money mess.   ### All about the financial assistance agreement form  You’ll need to complete the appropriate financial assistance agreement form each semester. For the most aid consideration, be sure to submit your completed agreement before classes start.   #### IUPUI  If you’re studying at IUPUI and an Ivy Tech Central Indiana campus, complete the Passport Financial Assistance Agreement .   #### IUPUC  If you’re studying at IUPUC and Ivy Tech Columbus, complete the Financial Assistance Agreement .  Please contact the Office of Student Financial Services at 317-274-4162 or finaid@iupui.edu with questions or to request these forms in an accessible format.  Make sure you allow at least one month for the entire process to be completed:  Your home school can’t disburse your financial aid funds until this process is complete. You’re responsible for any charges to your student account at both schools until your financial aid has been awarded.   ### Make sure you pay your bill  Tuition, fees, books, and other charges at your host school are your responsibility. Keep in mind that in most cases, your home school won’t make payments directly to your host school. You’re expected to use any financial aid refund from your home school to pay your expenses at your host school.   ### Exceptions to the rule  If you receive any awards from the Indiana Commission for Higher Education (ICHE) , your home school will pay those directly to your host school. These awards can be used only for tuition and mandatory fees and may not be enough to cover all of your charges at both schools. Be prepared to cover the balance if necessary.  [Indiana Commission for Higher Education (ICHE)](https://www.in.gov/che/4498.htm)   ### Do you have a CVO award?  If you have an award through the Child of a Disabled Veteran Program or the Public Safety Officer Supplemental Grant Program, known collectively as the CVO Program, you can use the award at both schools. In order to do so, you must:  [ScholarTrack](https://scholartrack.che.in.gov)   ### Dropping a class under a financial assistance agreement  Before you drop a class at either campus, contact the financial aid office at your home school. Your awards may be adjusted to reflect your new enrollment status.  If you drop a class at your host school, you must immediately notify the financial aid office at your home school to assess the effect on your financial aid.   ### Have questions?   #### If you’re studying at IUPUI  If you have questions about using financial aid via the Passport Financial Assistance Agreement, contact your home school.  IUPUI Office of Student Financial Services  or  [Ivy Tech Central Indiana Financial Aid Office](https://www.ivytech.edu/financial-aid/)   #### If you’re studying at IUPUC  If you have questions about using financial aid via the Financial Assistance Agreement, contact your home school.  IUPUC Student Financial Services  [IUPUC Student Financial Services](https://students.iupuc.edu/contact/index.html)  or  [Ivy Tech Columbus Financial Aid Office](https://www.ivytech.edu/financial-aid/)  If you have general questions about the financial assistance program or how to enroll, contact IUPUC at passport@iupuc.edu or 812-348-7390.

If you have Title IV financial aid such as a Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant, Direct Loan, Perkins Loan, or PLUS loan (parents or graduate students), you can use your aid to pay for noninstitutional charges such as your parking permit or recreation fee.  You’ll need to have a Title IV authorization on file for federal aid money to be applied to these charges automatically. If you don’t sign an authorization, you’ll have to wait for your financial aid refund before you can pay the remaining balance on your account, and your account might be past due.  Be sure to sign your Title IV authorization before your aid is applied to your student account (usually around 10 days before classes start).

    "body": "  ## Take a class without affecting your GPA  Interested in a course, but don’t want to worry about how it’ll affect your GPA? You can take the course for no credit, which is known as auditing.  Audited courses aren’t counted as completed academic credit and don’t count toward your degree progress. They also don’t count toward your enrollment status for financial aid or loan deferment purposes.  An audited course will be listed on your grade report and on your transcript as NC (no credit). You won’t receive a grade for courses you audit.  After you’ve started the audit process, you can’t change back to a letter grade for the course. Also, some schools do not allow students to register for a course for credit after they’ve audited it.  Tuition for an audited course is the same as when you take the course for credit.  [Audit a course Fill out this form to request permission to audit a course.](https://iupuireg-fireform.eas.iu.edu/online/form/index/audit)   ### Audit a course  Fill out this form to request permission to audit a course.   ### Why audit a course?  There are several reasons you might choose to audit a course:  Each school and department can choose whether or not to allow students to audit a class. Talk to your advisor, and check with the department you’re interested in to see what its policies and requirements are for auditing. You must also discuss coursework expectations with the instructor. Note that in some cases, you will not be able to get permission to audit a class.  If auditing isn’t quite the right choice, you might consider taking a class pass/fail . Talk with your academic advisor to determine your best option.   ### How to audit  If you are interested in auditing a course, you can submit an audit request electronically by completing the form below. All audit requests are routed to the instructor of the course, and then to the Office of the Registrar for approval. If you have questions about this process, you can contact the Office of the Registrar at 317-274-1519 or iupuireg@iupui.edu .  The deadline to submit a request to audit a course varies by semester. You can find detailed information regarding audit and other important deadlines on the official calendar .

    "body": "  ## Having trouble registering?  There are a few common reasons you might not be able to register for classes. Find out what they are—and what you need to do to fix them.   ### Holds on your account  You won’t be able to register for classes if there’s a hold on your account. Before you register, check your record holds to make sure you’re in the clear.  [check your record holds](https://one.iu.edu/task/iu/view-holds-on-my-record)  Here are some of the reasons you might have a hold:  [meet with an advisor](https://one.iu.edu/task/iu/student-appointment-scheduler)  If there’s a hold on your account, you’ll see the reason, the department that issued it, and what you need to do next. Holds are usually released 24 hours after you take action. Once all holds are cleared, you’ll be allowed to register.  [Find out if you have a hold](https://one.iu.edu/task/iu/view-holds-on-my-record)   ### Missing prerequisites  In some cases, you’re expected to complete a course or get an appropriate score on a placement test before being allowed to enroll in a higher-level course. Prerequisites are usually listed as a class note in the schedule of classes . For example, “P: ENG-W 131” would indicate that you must complete ENG-W 131 or its equivalent before you can enroll in the course in question.   #### What happens if you try to enroll in a course with a prerequisite  If you’ve met the prerequisite requirement, you’ll be able to enroll in the course as normal.  If you’re eligible due to your current enrollment in the prerequisite, you’ll be able to enroll in the course. The department offering the course will verify after the current term that you passed the prerequisite.  If you haven’t met the prerequisite requirement and aren’t currently enrolled in the prerequisite, you’ll get an error message saying you’re not eligible to enroll in the course. Contact your academic advisor for more information.   #### Prerequisite screening issues  There are some prerequisites that the registration system doesn’t screen for. Departments reserve the right to review class rosters after registration to make sure all students are eligible. If you turn out to not be eligible for a course you’ve enrolled in, you may be asked to drop the course , or you may be administratively withdrawn . This is also true for any course with the note “Consent/Permission of Instructor Required.”   ### Permission problems   #### Class permissions  During registration, any class that requires specific approval for a student to enroll will be denoted with “PERM.” Contact the department to find out if you’re eligible to take the class.   #### School authorization  Classes are sometimes restricted to students who are enrolled in the school offering the course. If you’re not enrolled in the school but want to take the class, you’ll need to contact the school or department to find out if you’re eligible.   #### Class standing  In some cases, departments require students to have a certain class standing (e.g., sophomore, junior) in order to enroll in a course. If you don’t meet this requirement, contact the department to find out if you’re eligible.  Because class standing is determined by the number of credit hours you’ve passed at IU, visiting students and graduate nondegree students won’t automatically meet class standing requirements.   #### Career level restrictions  Undergraduate students can’t register in graduate-level courses without specific permission from the department.  If a department or school grants permission for you to enroll, the registration system will then allow you to register for the class. Note that the granting of permission does not guarantee you a seat in the class—it means you’ll be able to enroll if a seat is available.

The system was designed to give you useful, timely feedback on your performance and to guide you to resources available to help you.   ### Find out how you’re doing  You can start checking your feedback through the Student Engagement Roster (Student) Tile in One.IU . You will also see a link in each of your courses in Canvas to check your feedback.  [Student Engagement Roster (Student) Tile](https://one.iu.edu/task/iu/student-engagement-roster-student)  [One.IU](https://one.iu.edu/)  Your instructors can submit updates throughout the term, so make sure you check on your performance multiple times. Choose “Prior Feedback” to see your earlier performance information.  If your performance roster says only “No Feedback,” that means your instructor has not reported any problems.   ### What happens if you’ve been flagged?  You’ll be notified by email if one of your instructors has raised a performance flag. If you’re asked to take action, make sure you do so right away to avoid potential problems with your academic record or financial aid.

Your instructor has the right to set a specific date, up to one year, by which you must complete all unfinished work.  In some cases, your instructor may recommend or require you to attend another term (or portion of a term) of the course to remove your I. In this case, don’t register for the course a second time. Instead, make arrangements with your instructor to sit in on the course as required.

[National Student Exchange](https://uc.iupui.edu/student-support-programs/national-student-exchange/index.html)   ### Study in Indianapolis at CUE member institutions  With CUE, you can enroll in undergraduate courses at certain other Indianapolis universities if those courses aren’t available at your home institution. This cross-registration enables you to enhance your undergraduate degree program by receiving credit for courses you successfully complete at your host institution.   ### Home vs. host institution  Your home institution is where you’re regularly enrolled. Your host institution is where you want to cross-register.   #### CUE member institutions  Academic calendars for each CUE institution vary.

Next, talk with your advisor about your course selection. You’ll need to get signatures from your advisor and dean on the cross-registration application. Submit your completed application to the IUPUI Office of the Registrar .  The CRO will determine your eligibility to enroll through CUE and will contact the CRO at the host institution to find out if there’s space in the course you want to enroll in. If so, IUPUI will send your application to the host institution’s CRO. IUPUI’s CRO will then complete arrangements for you and secure your place in the desired class.  You’ll need to contact the host’s CRO for information about their institutional policies, such as parking regulations, student ID cards, and other information if the host CRO doesn’t provide this information to you in advance. You’ll also need to pay any laboratory or special fees to the host institution as appropriate.  After you’ve taken the course, the host CRO will send your official, final grade to IUPUI’s CRO. The course and grade will be processed and will appear on your IUPUI transcript as having been taken while you were a student at IUPUI. The grade will be included in your IUPUI GPA.   ### Policies, eligibility, and conditions  Your CUE enrollment eligibility is determined by your home institution and is subject to the rules and conditions outlined here.   #### Rules   #### Conditions   ### Courses that aren’t included in cross-registration   ### Discover more options  [Learn about the National Student Exchange](https://uc.iupui.edu/student-support-programs/national-student-exchange/index.html) "

    "body": "  ## Find money for college  We know the thought of paying for college can be overwhelming—but your education is one of the best investments you can make. Financial aid can help you cover your costs.  Financial aid falls into one of three categories:  Before you apply for aid, make sure you understand the different types and what the requirements of each are. In order to receive most types of aid, you must meet general eligibility requirements determined by the U.S. Department of Education. You must also be enrolled in a degree program or an eligible certificate program .  [general eligibility requirements](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/eligibility/requirements)   ### What to expect  Most types of aid we award are need-based. We calculate your need by subtracting your Expected Family Contribution (EFC) from your cost of attendance (COA).   #### Cost of attendance (COA)  The COA is our estimate of your educational expenses for the academic year. It includes estimates for tuition and fees, books and supplies, room and board, transportation, and personal expenses. (If you’re an undergrad attending fewer than 6 hours or a grad student attending fewer than 4 hours, your COA won’t include transportation, room and board, or personal expenses.)   #### Expected Family Contribution (EFC)  The U.S. Department of Education uses the information you report on your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to calculate your EFC . We use your EFC to determine whether you’re eligible for certain types of aid, and if so, how much you can be awarded. (Your EFC doesn’t tell you what you’ll pay for your education, though. In many cases, families contribute more than the EFC to cover all expenses.)  [EFC](https://studentaid.gov/help/efc)  Keep in mind that there’s no guarantee you’ll receive the whole amount you need to cover all of your expenses.

    "body": "  ## You really want that course—and so does everyone else  Interested in registering for a class, but all the seats are filled? You can join the waitlist. If a seat later becomes available, the waitlist system will attempt to place a student into that open seat. The first student on the waitlist who meets the eligibility requirements will be placed into the class.  Note that your enrollment status is based on the number of credit hours for which you’re registered—waitlist hours don’t count. If you need to maintain a certain enrollment level, register for a schedule that will work for you and use the drop if enrolled option.  You won’t be able to waitlist a course that requires class or school authorization until the department has granted you permission. Make sure to request permission as soon as possible—ideally before your authorized registration time.   ### Check your waitlist status daily  Once you place yourself on a waitlist, it is your responsibility to monitor your waitlist status in My Class Schedule .  [My Class Schedule](https://one.iu.edu/task/iu/my-class-schedule)  If you decide not to take a course you have waitlisted, you must drop the waitlist request to ensure you are not placed in the class. If you’re placed in the class before you have a chance to remove yourself from the waitlist, you’ll need to drop the class .  Once waitlist processing has ended, your request will automatically expire if you have not been added to the class. If you still wish to try to add the class after your request expires, follow the procedures for adding a class .   ### Using the drop if enrolled option  If you want to enroll in a course while you wait to see if you’ll make it into another one, you can choose the drop if enrolled option. This lets you identify a course you’ve scheduled to be automatically dropped if your waitlist request is satisfied. (Note that a waitlist request cannot be used as a drop if enrolled for another waitlist request.)  If you haven’t selected a class to drop if your waitlist request is fulfilled, you can use the change waitlist drop option in the Student Center to update your waitlist request without losing your waitlist position.  [Student Center](https://one.iu.edu/task/iu/student-center)  If you’re still on the waitlist on the first day of classes, you’ll need to decide whether or not to drop your waitlist request and stay in the class you’re registered for. If your waitlist request isn’t filled by the end of waitlist processing, you’ll remain in your registered class for the term—so be sure to attend that class while you wait. If your schedule permits, you should also attend the class you’ve waitlisted.   ### Frequently asked questions about the waitlist system   #### Which courses have waitlists?  Most courses are waitlist eligible. If a course requires class or school authorization , you won’t be able to waitlist it until the department has authorized you.   #### Can I add a waitlist request after I register?  Yes, you can add a waitlist request during any open registration period, whether it’s your initial registration or a schedule adjustment.   #### Can I add a waitlist request for more than one class in the same course?  Yes, you can waitlist each class number that would meet your scheduling need.   #### Can I drop a waitlist request?  Yes, you can drop requests during normal drop/add periods .   #### When does the waitlist matching system run?  From the start of registration through the week before the start of the term, the waitlist matching system runs periodically based on waitlist activity. From the week before the start of the term through the end of the waitlist processing period, the waitlist matching system runs every night.   #### How long will my name stay on the waitlist?  Your name will stay on the waitlist until the last day of waitlist processing . If your request hasn’t been satisfied by this date, it’ll automatically expire—though the request will continue to appear on your class schedule.   #### Is there any way to get into the class if my request isn’t filled?  If you still want to add the class after the last day of waitlist processing, follow the drop/add procedures .   #### How are fees handled?  Fees from waitlist registration and schedule adjustments are held to the same fee payment schedule as traditional scheduling.  Still have questions about waitlists?
