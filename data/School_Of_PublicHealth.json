    "body": "  ## Reflections on a Milestone Year  The year 2019 served as a monumental year for the IU Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health, as it marked 50 years of the Master of Health Administration program. Established in 1969, the program has not only grown over the years, but has helped yield the largest health administration alumni network in the state.  To commemorate such a milestone year, the Fairbanks School of Public Health hosted an MHA 50th Anniversary Celebration and fundraising event in October at the Mavris Arts & Event Center. The event allowed alumni, faculty, students and friends an opportunity to mingle, network and celebrate the program’s history and success. It also provided guests an opportunity to give back and support the next generation of health administration leaders, as all ticket proceeds were donated to the Master of Healthcare Administration Legacy Scholarship.  The full list of sponsors that helped offset the event costs to allow ticket proceeds to support the MHA program, includes Ascension St. Vincent, Community Health Network, Indiana University Health, Hall, Render, Killian, Heath & Lyman, P.C., Blue & Company, the Indiana Hospital Association and Franciscan Health. Thanks to our generous sponsors and guests, more than $80,000 was raised. Photos and moments captured during the MHA 50th Celebration are now available online.  [Photos and moments](https://www.flickr.com/photos/185889476@N08/)  In addition to the celebration, several initiatives were implemented throughout the year to enhance the experiences of students and alumni moving forward.  Those initiatives included:  The MHA program also wrapped the year ranking as one of the Best Healthcare Management Programs in the country, according to the U.S. News & World Report's Best Grad School Rankings for 2020. Looking ahead, the MHA program plans to continue leading the way in educating Indiana’s health administration workforce.  Continue celebrating the 50 th anniversary by joining the Fairbanks School of Public Health for a reception at the 2020 American College of Healthcare Executives (ACHE) Annual Congress on Healthcare Leadership. The event will be Tuesday, March 24 from 6:30-8:00pm at the Hyatt Regency Chicago, Toronto Room.   "

    "body": "  ## Frequently asked questions   ## Who should apply to the Doctoral Program in Global Health Leadership (DrPH) program?  The program is designed for mid- to senior-level healthcare professionals in the U.S. or anywhere in the world working full-time in positions with substantial leadership or management responsibility and the potential to influence the public’s health. We are specifically recruiting individuals in field-based positions with practice-oriented career goals.  Competitive applicants fall into two categories. Those eligible for our advanced cohort will have five or more years of mid- to senior-level leadership experience beyond the master’s degree. Successful applicants will have demonstrated leadership abilities and aspirations for senior-level leadership positions in organizations where they can have maximum influence on the public’s health.  We also admit a second cohort of emerging leaders. These individuals are more junior than those in our advanced cohort but have at least three years of mid- to senior-level leadership experience beyond the master’s degree.  Please note that we generally do not admit individuals whose primary positions are in academia or for whom research is the primary professional activity or aspiration. This particular program is designed to meet the needs of field-based practitioners, and the curriculum focus is on practice as opposed to preparation for a teaching or research career.  While teaching abilities and research skills are certainly relevant for practice and are components of this program, our program mission is to build leadership capacity among the mid- and senior-level global health practice community. Stronger applicants are those who are responsible for leading teams as opposed to working as consultants or as sole contributors.   ## How does the DrPH program differ from the PhD program and from other DrPH programs?  Generally, DrPH degrees are meant for individuals with practice-oriented career goals. PhD programs are designed for individuals who aspire to academic careers or careers in research. Of course, there are always exceptions, and once you have earned either degree, you can leverage it to excel in a wide range of settings, including in some nontraditional or entrepreneurial roles.  The Fairbanks Doctoral Program in Global Health Leadership (DrPH) is unique among DrPH programs for several reasons. Since the mission of the program is to cultivate leadership qualities and prepare experienced health professionals for top jobs, the typical candidate for this program is somewhat older and more experienced. Other programs admit students who are more junior in their careers.  This DrPH program uses a cohort model, so everyone admitted in a given year progresses through the program in lock step with his or her cohort mates, and everyone takes every course, regardless of prior experience or academic preparation.  All of the classes are conducted via Internet video, and everyone in the program is working full time. So the student body is diverse with a high proportion of international students from low, middle and high resource countries. The curriculum is also globalized; graduates are prepared to apply their skills in diverse settings around the world.   ## What kind of jobs will the DrPH program prepare students for?  Students in our DrPH program are already employed full time, and many aim to remain with their current employers once they finish the program. However, we expect graduates to leverage their DrPH degrees to move into progressively higher-level positions in which they can have maximum influence on the public’s health.  Typical positions include executive director, partner, senior manager, CEO, president, and other top positions in government agencies, foundations, NGOs, not-for-profit or for-profit organizations, health ministries, and others.   ## How many students are accepted each year?  We accept two cohorts per year:  A hallmark of the program is the diversity of each cohort. We strive to admit strong cohorts of individuals from a wide variety of disciplinary backgrounds and geographic locations, with varied types of personal and professional experience, and diversity in race, ethnicity, gender identity, political typology and so on.  In short, we aim to admit cohorts of individuals who are as different from one another as possible to create the richest possible learning environment. Thus, we regret that we may be unable to admit all qualified applicants in a given year. Strong applicants who are not admitted on the first try may be encouraged to reapply the following year.   ## Is a public health degree a prerequisite for admission into the program?  No. A degree in public health is not required. However, students must have a master’s degree or earned doctorate to be eligible for the program.  Students without a master’s degree in public health from an accredited school of public health will also need to complete core master's-level courses in epidemiology, health policy and management, biostatistics, social and behavioral science, and environmental health science, or document their equivalencies before a DrPH degree can be conferred.  We strongly recommend completion of these courses prior to beginning the DrPH program, though it is also feasible to complete the MPH core courses concurrently with the doctoral coursework.   ## How much work experience do I need to be eligible for the program?  Those admitted into the advanced cohort need a minimum of five years of post-graduate experience in the health field, in a substantial management or leadership position. Those admitted into the emerging leaders cohort need a minimum of three years of post-graduate experience in the health field, in a substantial management or leadership position.   ## Do DrPH students have the option of enrolling full-time or part-time?  Our program is technically part-time, since students take fewer than nine credit hours per semester.   ## Can I transfer graduate course credits to the DrPH program?  We do not accept transfer credits into the DrPH program. This is a customized program in which cohort members contribute unique insights in each class, thereby shaping and enriching the curriculum.   ## Is the DrPH program accredited?  There is no U.S. accreditation for DrPH programs, or for most individual degree programs. The Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health is accredited by the Council on Education for Public Health (CEPH) .  [Council on Education for Public Health (CEPH)](http://ceph.org/)  However, the Association of Schools and Programs in Public Health (ASPPH) led a task force, “Framing the Future: The Second Hundred Years of Education for Public Health.\" A DrPH expert panel was convened to examine key considerations and design and content issues related to the DrPH degree.  The panel issued a final report and recommendations in November 2014. These recommendations were the catalyst for refinements to the CEPH accreditation criteria in 2016, including new guidance for DrPH programs. The CEPH revised criteria can be found here . The DrPH program at Fairbanks complies with these criteria.  [The CEPH revised criteria can be found here](https://ceph.org/about/org-info/criteria-procedures-documents/criteria-procedures/)   ## Where and when do classes take place?  Classes are conducted via internet video during a three-hour block of time one day per week. Faculty and scholars may participate from anywhere in the world where they have reliable access to the Internet.  Class times may vary from year to year, depending on the locations of individuals in each cohort. We do our best to pick a class time that minimizes inconveniences for the majority of cohort members. Typical class times are 4-7 p.m. EST or 5-8 p.m. EST.  Classes typically meet on Tuesdays or Wednesdays. Program coursework occurs in the first two years of the program, including fall, spring and summer semesters. See the scholar handbook for further details about the curriculum and schedule. To receive an accessible format of the scholar handbook, please email fsphinfo@iu.edu .   ## Do I have to come to Indianapolis?  Yes. Students meet face-to-face on campus for three to four days in mid-August and mid-May, in addition to an early January virtual residency in each of years one and two of the program. We also try to replace one on-campus visit each year or every other year with a visit outside Indiana or overseas during the two years of required coursework.   ## What kind of Internet connection is required to participate?  You must have a high-speed DSL or cable connection. Dial-up connections do not work with our program design.   ## Do students complete a dissertation in this program?  Scholars complete dissertations or field-based, culminating projects in year three.  Dissertations have the same components as a traditional PhD dissertation but with one extra chapter, a “plan for change” that, if implemented, would improve the public’s health. Alternatively, scholars may opt to complete field-based, culminating projects that include production of at least two papers publishable in peer-reviewed, practice-oriented journals or another scholarly outlet.  Scholars begin planning their dissertations or projects during the first year and spend most of the third year completing them. While most scholars finish the program in three to four years, up to five years is permitted.   ## Do I need GRE or GMAT scores to apply?  No. We do not require current standardized test scores, as most applicants will have been out in the field and away from formal education for a substantial amount of time before admission into this program. We believe that applicant profiles gleaned from previous academic preparation, work experience, professional references and, most importantly, written personal statements and, for finalists, phone interviews, provide us with the strongest predictors of success in this doctoral program.   ## Is financial support available for students in the DrPH program?  At this time we do not offer financial support for students in the program. We are working to identify sources of funding support such as scholarships, particularly for students in low resource settings. We welcome inquiries from individuals interested in supporting our program.   ## How much are tuition and fees for the DrPH program?  Tuition and fees are $570 per credit hour for in-state, $1,500 per credit hour for out-of-state and international students. "

Students admitted to the BSPH program for fall 2023 and beyond should refer to the updated BSPH-MPH program track .  The accelerated 4+1 MPH in Social and Behavioral Sciences (SBS) allows you to graduate with both Bachelor of Science in Public Health-Community Health and Master of Public Health-SBS degrees in just five years.  This program is one year less than the traditional six-year path of obtaining a bachelor’s and master’s degree, saving time and money and giving you the specialized skills and experience needed to be the next champion of community and public health.  This degree combines the foundations of public health and principles of community health from the BSPH with the academic theory, research, and real-world experience of the MPH-SBS degree. The 4+1 accelerated program may also be combined with pre-professional coursework.   ### Plan of study  You will complete three years of bachelor’s degree requirements. During your third year, you will apply for the accelerated program. If accepted into the accelerated program, you will complete your first year of MPH coursework during what would have been your fourth year of undergraduate study.  That MPH coursework takes the place of your final BSPH required courses. You will then graduate with your bachelor’s degree the spring after your first year in the MPH program.   ### Eligibility  The accelerated program is a competitive opportunity for outstanding public health students. To be eligible to apply, you must have a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.5 and a B+ or higher in the following courses: PBHL-S120, PBHL-S220, PBHL-S305, PBHL-S315, and PBHL-S340.  Prior to the start of your senior year, you must have all but five major public health elective courses completed for your BSPH degree. These courses will be replaced with MPH courses taken the first year of the MPH program/last year of the BSPH program.  If you meet the above criteria, you are not guaranteed admission. All elements of the application including letters of recommendation, scores, GPA, résumé, interview, and personal statement will be taken into consideration.   ### When to apply  You are encouraged to apply during fall or spring semesters of your junior year; however, the deadline for accelerated BSPH-MPH applications is June 1. Accepted BSPH-MPH accelerated students will matriculate into the MPH program during the fall semester of your senior year.   ### How to apply  You should complete the application in the spring semester of your junior year by the application deadline.

He also feels it is a wonderful base for any graduate program, as he has used this degree as a platform to pursue his MD-MPH.   ### Luz Machuca, BSPH-CH'19  After graduating, Luz started a paid summer internship at the Youth Diabetes Prevention Clinic where she assists with recruiting, planning, implementation, and evaluation of a new community diabetes prevention program. She also does data entry for participants and facilitates health education sessions.   ### Kacie McGill, BSPH-CH'17  Before graduating, Kacie completed a summer internship at Healthy Communities of Clinton County Coalition, a local nonprofit that works to improve the overall well-being of Clinton County and other surrounding areas. Having grown up in Clinton County, she is excited to now to be involved in improving the wellbeing of its members by helping to reduce the county's tobacco burden.

    "body": "  ## PhD in Biostatistics FAQs   ### Let us answer your questions  Our Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) make it easy for you to find answers to your most pressing inquiries into the PhD in Biostatistics program. If you can't find your answer here, please feel free to contact us or use the site search to find the information you need.   ### Cost and financial support   ### How much will I pay for tuition and fees for the Biostatistics PhD program?  Tuition and fees are $582 per credit hour for in-state students and $1,412 for both out-of-state students.   ### Is financial support available for students in Biostatistics FAQ program?  Financial support is available to qualified students in the form of teaching assistantships (TAs), research assistantships (RAs), or university fellowships. In addition, supported students receive a fee scholarship, which remits most of the cost of tuition and payment of the mandatory student health insurance premium.  Financial support may be renewed for up to 10 semesters provided the recipient is making satisfactory progress toward the degree and is discharging the teaching or research assignment in an approved and professional manner. As the objective of financial support is to allow the student to devote their full effort to their studies and research responsibilities, it is expected that recipients will not hold any outside employment.  About teaching assistantships To qualify for a teaching assistantship, foreign students must take the SPEAK exam (oral English proficiency) administered by the IU Indianapolis ESL program. Students who do not pass the exam must enroll in G020 Communication Skills for TAs before retaking the exam.  Teaching assistants will be responsible for teaching (instruction, recitation, tutoring, and/or grading) up to 20 hours per week during the fall and spring semesters, plus one of the six-week summer sessions. Vacation time is dictated by the academic calendar and is not to exceed four weeks per academic year.  Students whose performance as a TA is deemed unsatisfactory will be notified so they can improve their performance. If sufficient improvement has not been made by the end of the following semester, support will be terminated.  About research assistantships Some program faculty may have research grants that include a 12-month stipend, tuition remission, and fees for graduate students assigned to work on the funded research project. The availability of research assistantships varies each year.  Awards are usually not made by the department, but rather are arranged with the professor serving as PI or the leading investigator of the funded research project.  Research assistants are expected to devote up to 20 hours per week to their assigned research responsibilities during the year. Vacation time must be pre-arranged with the RA supervisor, and is not to exceed four weeks per academic year.  Students whose performance as an RA is deemed insufficient will be notified and given one semester to correct the deficiency. If sufficient improvement is not made, support will be terminated.  About university fellowships Doctoral students with outstanding credentials may receive competitive first-year IU Indianapolis fellowships. If university stipends are less than support levels offered by the program, students will be guaranteed support equal to minimum program levels after the first year, contingent on satisfactory performance. All first-year fellowships come with fee remission and graduate student health insurance.   ### Application   ### How do I apply for admission?  Applicants must apply online through SOPHAS .

There are countless opportunities and paths to pursue, which is why we strive to equip our students with the tools and support they need to choose the public health career best for them.  Our Bachelor of Science in Health Services Management alumni working in the field were once prospective students too. Many of them have agreed to share their success stories in hopes of helping you discover a career path you will love.   ### Kendall Ranges, BSHSM'22   #### Clinical Quality Strategy Intern, Elevance Health  Kendall chose health services management to observe how the intersection of business professionals in healthcare can improve community health and patient health outcomes. He never really heard of health administration and like the majority of his peers you have always seen it but never knew what it was or how impactful it can be without giving hands-on healthcare delivery.  Read Kendall's story  [Read Kendall's story](https://blogs.iu.edu/publichealth/2023/02/09/alumni-career-spotlight-kendall-ranges/)   ### Alexa Abbott, BSHSM'20   #### Executive Director, Miller’s Health Systems  After becoming a certified nursing assistant, Alexa quickly realized she did not want to be a nurse. Being an executive director is the best of both worlds, she says. She is able to interact with residents and is involved in all of the day to day decisions and operations. Instead of direct patient care, she is more behind the scenes, which is her preference.  [Read Alexa's story](https://blogs.iu.edu/publichealth/2022/07/14/alumni-career-spotlight-alexa-abbott/)   ### Agatha Beier, BSHSM'21   #### Medical Scribe, Robin Healthcare  While taking an exploratory course her freshman year, Agatha remembers listening to fellow students talk about the degrees IUPUI offered. The student from Fairbanks School of Public Health explained the importance of public health, including epidemiology, finance, and policy. It was a perfect degree path for her as she knew she wanted to work in the healthcare field.  [Read Agatha's story](https://blogs.iu.edu/publichealth/2022/03/25/alumni-career-spotlight-agatha-beier/)   ### Brad Haney, BSHSM'21   #### Operations Liaison, Riverview Health  When Brad took an EMT class he was hooked on EMS. He then received his paramedic certificate and worked for the City of Indianapolis. He chose his current role as operations liaison because it was closely related to his previous career as a paramedic.  [Read Brad's story](https://blogs.iu.edu/publichealth/2022/06/30/alumni-career-spotlight-brad-haney/)   ### Christine Krieger, BSHSM 2017   #### Service Center Representative, JWM Neurology  Christine says the lessons she learned from the Health Services Management program have not left her. She chose this major because she wanted to provide care for others in a non-traditional way. Working at JWM Neurology, Christine now services more than 40 neurological care providers at eight offices throughout the Indianapolis area.   ### Elena Smith, BSHSM 2017   #### Pre-Services Coordinator, Eskenazi Health  Wanting to get involved with the constant changes in the health field, Elena was eager to study Health Services Management. Completing the program, she decided to enter the workforce and accepted her first position as pre-services coordinator at Eskenazi Health.   ### Joseph Wamathai, BSHSM 2017   #### Billing and Reimbursement Specialist, Express Scripts  Joseph spent several years working as a caregiver and wanted to transition into an administrative or management role. He first earned an associate degree from Ivy Tech and then transferred to IUPUI for the Health Services Management program. He is now a part of the finance department's escalations team at Express Scripts.   ### Sarah Vivo, BSHSM 2016   #### Program Manager, American Cancer Society  Sarah was working with patients in the hospital setting, but believes real healing requires more than tests and prescriptions. That’s ultimately why she chose this program. As a graduate, she now enjoys working at a nonprofit, providing important supportive services that complement the traditional \"diagnosis and treatment\" side of medicine.   ### Tyler Childress, BSHSM 2016   #### Grant Coordinator, Indiana School of Medicine  Tyler was at a crossroads before choosing to major in Health Services Management. He wanted to be in the healthcare industry, but also wanted to study business. Today, Tyler assists MDs and PhDs with grant funding, helping to construct their budgets.   ### Viola Long, BSHSM 2016   #### Practice Operations Assistant, IU Health Physicians  Viola was originally focused on pre-med; she always knew she wanted to work in healthcare because she always had a passion for helping and inspiring others. Since completing the Health Services Management program, she has worked for three divisions within IU Health and currently works for the Digestive and Liver Disorders clinic.   ### Abby Lauck, BSHSM 2015   #### Project Coordinator, MHP Major Hospital  Abby always knew she wanted to be in the healthcare industry. She started studying nursing, but didn’t believe nursing was the best fit for her. Abby completed the Health Services Management program and now works as a project coordinator on new construction and renovation projects throughout her organization.   ### Josh Burger, BSHSM 2010   #### Provider Data Manager, MDwise  Josh’s decision to major in Health Services Management was, in his words, plain and simple – he wanted to be a leader in the healthcare industry. His first job after graduating was with IU Medical Group Primary Care as a Provider Relations Assistant. He had multiple advancements there and at Eskenazi Health before finding himself at MDwise, where he works today.  Want to share your career story?

You’ll learn what top thought leaders say about key aspects of administration of today’s health systems.  This is a minor that is easy to customize to your specific interests. You will take two required health administration courses, then you will choose three electives from a list that includes health care management, policy, marketing, legal issues, human resources, and health information technology.   ### Minor requirements   ## Required Courses  Take two courses for 6 credits:  *These courses are offered online at least once per year.  Substitution note: PBHL-H220 will be considered an acceptable substitution for PBHL-H120 for public health majors. PBHL-H320 may be an acceptable substitution for PBHL-H375 for students who started the minor prior to fall 2023. Please reach out to a Fairbanks School of Public Health academic advisor for confirmation.   ## Elective Courses  Choose three elective courses for 9 credits:  *These courses are offered online at least once per year.  **These courses are offered online in the summer.   ### Why I chose a health administration minor  I began working in a pharmacy at the age of 16 and learned quickly I enjoyed working with customers to best utilize their health care and manage their prescription costs. Over time, I learned I was passionate about making the administration side of health insurance 'make sense' for my customers. This minor builds on that passion. It also easily fits into my existing course schedule as a General Studies major, allowing me to expand my education and graduate on time. It also opens doors for potential future studies, such as graduate school.” - Matt Whitlock, Major: General Studies      I chose to be a Health Administration Minor because I really enjoyed taking PBHL-H120: Health Care Delivery in the US. It was fascinating to learn about what goes on behind the scenes in health care.” - Madison Gloyeske, Major: Nursing    “I chose to minor in health administration because I decided that I wanted to build on my Health Science major and gain valuable health administration skills that would help me get into a Master’s in Health Administration program after graduation.” - Kayla Saunders, Major: Health Sciences      “I feel like it is important to understand how health care facilities run, and how the health system works in order to be a good nurse. - Braxton Gray, Major: Nursing   ### Eligibility criteria  Students enrolled in baccalaureate programs at Indiana University who are in good academic standing.  The health administration minor is a great fit for students majoring in:  Public health students majoring in health services management are not eligible for the health administration minor.  Students who successfully complete the requirements for the minor with a grade of \"C\" or better in all courses credited to the minor will have the minor conferred at time of graduation.   ### Ready to get started?

    "body": "  ## From Student to Health Services Management Advocate  A senior at the Indiana University Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health at IUPUI, Grace Arbuckle loves everything about health services management. Growing up in Elwood, Indiana, she had a first-hand look at health administration.  “I heard about health services management through a family member that is an administrator of a long-term care facility, so I looked into it,” Arbuckle said.  Although she wasn’t sure about the field, she visited the Health and Life Sciences office on campus to learn more about it and quickly realized it was perfect for her.  “Working in health services management means options!” Arbuckle said. “I can literally work in any healthcare setting doing just about whatever I’m interested in on the administrative side – and you can’t get that with other majors.”  Arbuckle explained that having so many career options with the same degree is fascinating, but getting to know the faculty and staff of her program has been her favorite experience thus far.  “I feel like with other majors you never get to truly bond with the professors, but I have gotten to know all of my professors on a better level,” Arbuckle said.  In fact, Arbuckle has a couple of class favorites. “My favorite classes have been Advanced Healthcare Finance with Paul Lang, and Healthcare Marketing with Rebecca Carl.”  Arbuckle is involved in several volunteer organizations on campus, including the IUPUI OTEAM, Sigma Kappa, and the Undergraduate Association for the Fairbanks School of Public Health, but she also knows the importance of gaining professional experience in her field.  She not only completed an internship at Eskenazi Hospital last fall, but she is also currently interning at Community Health Network Touchpoint as a project coordinator assistant.  “There are so many opportunities for internships and potential employers one day,” Arbuckle explained. “Just on IUPUI’s campus we have five hospitals, and a few blocks down we have the Indiana State Department of Health.”  While she said she promotes the Health Services Management department as much as she can, Arbuckle said she wishes more people knew what it was. “I get students and adults asking me what my major is all the time. People just don’t know!”  If she had to describe her major to a child or someone with no prior knowledge of it, she said she would describe it as “the business side of healthcare. It’s a broad degree that can be used for multiple types of management in the healthcare field.”  After graduation, Arbuckle hopes to complete her Master's in Health Administration here at the Fairbanks School of Public Health.\"I am just a nerd who likes school enough to want to get her MHA,\" Arbuckle said. \"I am most excited to graduate with the best friends I have made throughout the HSM program, and to one day work in long-term care administration.\" "

    "body": "  ## Health Administration Alumni Career Profiles  Trying to choose the best career path may be difficult when you have not had real experience in the public health field. There are countless opportunities and paths to pursue, which is why we strive to equip our students with the tools and support they need to choose the public health career best for them.  Our Master of Health Administration alumni working in the field were once prospective students too. Many of them have agreed to share their success stories in hopes of helping you discover a career path you will love.   ### Max Rios, MHA'20   #### Provider Relations and Compliance Specialist, Point Comfort Underwriters  It was always important to Max to pursue a higher education degree beyond undergrad. Max had been employed in public health institutions for years and so did not think an MPH would open up more job opportunities (Max works here already, after all) and so Max chose a Master of Health Administration in order to focus on the “business of healthcare.”  Read Max's story  [Read Max's story](https://blogs.iu.edu/publichealth/2023/08/17/alumni-career-spotlight-max-rios/)   ### Matthew Lyman, MHA'19   #### Business Change Director, Elevance Health  Matthew wanted a career that allowed him to make an impact.

    "body": "  ## HDS Student Internship Profile: Rebecca Gorman  BS in Health Data Science Student Major: Health Data Science  Rebecca Gorman, a health data science student at the IU Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health, was working with the research team in the Department of Environmental Health at FSPH when she discovered their need for an intern.  “They wanted someone to create two apps for them to use with their research,” Rebecca said. “They thought I would be the perfect person to do this since I already had a pretty extensive knowledge of R programming.”  Completing an internship is a requirement of the HDS program, but Rebecca said she is glad for it.  “I am glad it's required because it gives students the chance to really apply their knowledge outside of class and see how all of the topics we learn in the program apply to real-world problems.”  Rebecca is a double-major in health data science and environmental health science, which is why she chose to complete this internship. She had the opportunity to work with environmental health-related data, “which was really exciting.” Her responsibilities during the summer-long internship consisted of creating two Shiny web applications utilizing the R programming language.  “The first app I made was for researchers to use to better visualize a large dataset containing patient data from local hospitals,” Rebecca said.  Researchers will then use the app Rebecca created to assess trends in relation to factors caused by climate change, such as increased cases of asthma due to an increase in air pollution.  “The second app I created was a dashboard that will supplement the team's current website,” she said.”  By using a Shiny app for this, the team is able to better display and update their data and map visualizations. It also allows for easier sharing to local stakeholders, community members, and government officials, as well as easier viewing on different devices (laptop, smartphone, tablet, etc.).  While she had a brief overview of Shiny web applications prior to starting the internship, Rebecca said creating the apps using R programming was fairly new to her.  “The major new thing I learned through this internship was how to create Shiny web applications using R,” Rebecca said. “I had only had a brief overview of them from one of our hackathons, so I had to teach myself how to create, edit, and deploy them to the web over the course of the summer.”  Rebecca believes the skills and topics she is learning in the HDS program are what helped her during this internship, specifically data wrangling and cleaning.  “Having a better sense of the data I was working with and being able to form it to the needs of the researchers was a huge part of this job, and having prior experience doing that kind of stuff in class, and at hackathons, was really helpful,” she said.  After graduating, Rebecca originally had plans of going to graduate school for epidemiology; however, completing this internship has shifted her educational and career goals.  “I realized how much fun it is to explore data and create things that are useful, and that many people can understand. I have decided now to apply to the MS in Applied Data Science program here at IUPUI and pursue a career in data science in the public health field.” Rebecca’s dream job is to work in an informatics/data science role for the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).

    "body": "  ## MS in Biostatistics competencies  Biostatistics competence Biostatistical competency relates to the knowledge of biostatistics methods and their application, such as descriptive statistics, inference and statistical modeling. Along with awareness of biostatistical principles, the program will inculcate in the students a critical thinking in the selection of the appropriate statistical technique (e.g., linear versus logistic regression, parametric versus semi-parametric modeling for survival data, or mixed effects versus generalized estimating equation models for longitudinal data).  The program will also build skills in the design of clinical (interventional) versus observational studies, data collection schemes and the analysis of the collected data plus interpretation and communication of the study results to public health practitioners both expert and non-expert in biostatistical methodology.  A significant emphasis will be given to international issues affecting public health theory and practice as well of bioethics issues in research especially with respect to those arising in international or non-equitable settings.  Public health competence Public health competency refers to having a thorough understanding of the principles of screening and disease surveillance, prevention, observational and intervention studies, the local, national and global context of health problems, and the influence of cultural and social dimension of public health research and practice.  Computing and data management The program will emphasize the appropriate methods for the design of data collection systems in the context of biomedical research (both pre-clinical and clinical, including clinical trials and observational studies), as well as the proper management, analysis and interpretation of these data.  In addition to the collection, management and analysis of biomedical data, the program will provide a solid computational background to graduating students. Instruction will be primarily in SAS (The SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and R . However, other packages (e.g., STATA) and data management packages (e.g., REDCap) will be covered. Emphasis will be given to data analysis as well as quality control and data generation (simulations).  [R](https://www.r-project.org/)  The overarching philosophy of the MS Biostatistics program is learning by doing. This approach will culminate with the data analysis project, which will be performed under the mentorship of the student’s master’s thesis advisor along with other collaborators preferably outside the department of biostatistics. In this manner the student will be given an early appreciation of the application of biostatistical techniques in real-life settings.   ### Principles of Graduate and Professional Learning  Graduate students earning the MS in Biostatistics from the IU Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health will demonstrate the following Principles of Graduate and Professional Learning (PGPLs):   #### PGPL 1: Demonstrate knowledge and skills necessary to conduct biostatistical research.   ##### Method of acquisition:   ##### Assessment of learning:   #### PGPL 2: Effectively communicate biostatistical results.   ##### Method of acquisition:   ##### Assessment of learning:   #### PGPL 3: Think critically and creatively to solve problems in Biostatistics.   ##### Method of acquisition:   ##### Assessment of learning:   #### PGPL 4: Conduct biostatistical research in an ethical and responsible manner.   ##### Method of acquisition:   ##### Assessment of learning: "

Fairbanks School of Public Health’s alumna Nadia Nguyen Adams, MHA, is working to empower health practitioners with the information, services, and support needed to provide the best care, at a lower cost, for better health outcomes to over 10 million Midwest residents.  In recognition of her efforts, Adams has been selected by the Indianapolis Business Journal as a Forty Under 40 honoree.  IBJ’s Forty Under 40 program recognizes Central Indiana men and women who have become leaders in their fields before reaching their fifth decade, individuals who will continue to influence their city, region and nation in the future.  As the Chief Operating Officer of the Indiana University Center for Health Innovation and Implementation Science since 2015, Adams uses the tools of implementation science in support of the goal of producing high-quality, patient-centered and cost-efficient health care delivery solutions. To accomplish this mission, she helps partner innovative researchers with healthcare systems, connecting evidence-based knowledge with healthcare delivery needs.  The Great Lakes Practice Transformation Network, a major project of the center, seeks to improve health outcomes, reduce unnecessary hospitalizations and generate at least $1 billion in cost savings to payers. The network is successfully achieving better care, lower cost and improved outcomes. It is part of a national effort to work alongside healthcare professionals — from physicians and nurses to social workers and pharmacists — to improve the quality and reliability of care.  “Nadia is a leader with the ability to foster successful collaborations among traditionally disparate stakeholders — clinicians and hospital administrators — to benefit the patients they serve,” said Malaz Boustani, MD, MPH, founding director of the Center for Health Innovation and Implementation Science and Great Lakes Practice Transformation Network and associate director of the Indiana University Center for Aging Research. “This ability is key to quality improvement that patients need and deserve.”  Adams, a native of Fort Wayne and currently a resident of Boone County, received a Master of Health Administration degree from the Indiana University Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health, and received her undergraduate degree from Indiana University in Bloomington. She is a member of the American College of Healthcare Executives and the Indiana Healthcare Executives Network. A long-time activist for the disabled, she recently became a member of the board of directors of the ARC of Indiana.  “As the daughter of immigrants who needed help navigating the health care system with their special needs son, health care access and the delivery of the best care possible have been pressing concerns to me for as long as I can remember,” said Adams. “I am honored to receive IBJ’s Forty under 40 award and its acknowledgment that working with clinicians and administrators to improve health care matters.

Fairbanks School of Public Health at IU Fort Wayne observed more than 3,500 people at seven selected grocery stores in Fort Wayne. The study found that nearly 90% of customers wore masks, and did so properly. Dr. Ashley Robertson , assistant professor of Health Policy and Management served as lead on the study, and presented it at Fort Wayne's executive board of health meeting. Students volunteered to serve as observers in various locations around Allen County to help to determine how much compliance the county has with the statewide mask order.  [mask compliance study](https://www.wane.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2020/10/ACBOH_10_19_Meeting_Final_Copy-1.pptx)  They also gauged the mask order’s effectiveness in the Fort Wayne area by combining the mask compliance data with incidence and prevalence rates in the area.  With temperatures dropping and people heading indoors, Dr. Robertson stresses the importance of wearing masks.  \"This fall and winter are really what's going to test us,\" she said in an interview with Fort Wayne's NBC (video) . \"So I think we need to not be complacent, and remember masks really do help prevent the spread.\"  [Fort Wayne's NBC (video)](https://fortwaynesnbc.com/2020/10/19/allen-county-health-commissioner-concerned-about-rising-cases-study-shows-nearly-90-of-people-wear-masks/)  Dr. Robertson said the effort allows students to engage in the materials they are learning in-class, as well as learn about the current pandemic from a public health policy perspective.

On October 25, 2019, the Fairbanks School of Public Health will host a 50th Anniversary Celebration from 6pm-9pm at the Mavris Arts and Events Center.  [50th Anniversary Celebration](https://fsph.iupui.edu/alumni-giving/mha-celebration/index.html)  The two-year academic program was first approved on June 6, 1969 by Indiana University Trustees who believed the degree would meet an unmet need for business-oriented health administrators in the field of health.  Since 1969, the program has established a distinguished history of preparing students for management and leadership positions in healthcare organizations in Indiana and across the nation. In fact, many CEOs of Indiana-based health organizations are graduates of the MHA program.  The program first existed in the IU School of Medicine before moving to the O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs, and now resides within the IU Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health.  Today, the program continues to lead the way in educating Indiana’s health administration workforce, as it remains the only CAHME-accredited MHA program in Indiana and is ranked as one of the Best Healthcare Management Programs in the country, according to the U.S. News & World Report's Best Grad School Rankings for 2020.  The celebration event is made possible through the generous contributions of several donors, including Ascension St. Vincent; Community Health Network; Indiana University Health; Hall, Render, Killian, Heath & Lyman, P.C.; Blue & Company; the Indiana Hospital Association; and Franciscan Health. These leading organizations are helping to sustain and preserve the legacy of the program through the MHA celebration.  Tickets can be purchased online and all proceeds will go toward the MHA Legacy Scholarship honoring the influence of alumni from the program and launching the next generation of healthcare leaders.  Highlighted below are alumni who have also helped make this event possible through leadership, friendship and a belief that the next generation of students will sustain and preserve the legacy of the MHA program.  Watch our MHA video to learn more about the program and join us in a few weeks to celebrate everyone who has made this program what it is today!

    "body": "  ## Historic database of State Health Officials  This searchable database provides individual State Health Official (SHO) information and profiles. The database currently includes information for more than 1,300 SHOs going back to the earliest SHOs in US history.  Data fields include: SHO names and official titles, appointment and departure dates, and SHO tenure in both months and years. Profiles of those SHOs who served within the last 50 years (since 1967) include SHO educational credentials as well as the name(s) of the governor(s) they served under and their governor’s respective political affiliations.  This database was meticulously constructed by hand-searching historical paper documents, internet references, and through support from the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO), individual state health departments, and the de Beaumont Foundation. It is the intention that this historical repository will serve to foster and facilitate SHO collaboration and mentorship opportunities across the SHO community.  Search for all SHOs in a specific year (e.g., 2019) and/or search for an individual’s name (e.g. Smith) in the search box below. The dropdown menu for states will filter SHOs from the selected state only and present the list in reverse chronological order.  Should any errors be found, please contact Valerie Yeager at vyeager@iu.edu and, if possible, include information to be revised in the database. For more information on the assumptions and formulas used in the appointment and departure date data, please contact Valerie Yeager at the email provided.   ## Search all Officers  Filter selections  1295 results found  Don Rolston  G.

    "body": "  ## Internship Interview Day: A New Approach to Hiring  The Health Services Management program at the IU Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health implemented its first Internship Interview Day on November 1, 2019. The matchmaker approach allowed internship sites to conduct 30-minute interviews with five to six students they selected from a resume book prior to the event. After the event, sites ranked students they would be interested in working with and students ranked sites they would be interested in interning with. Matches were revealed the following week and the internships began spring 2020.  Many students who participated had positive things to say, such as, “It was fun to go through Interview Day as a group. It felt like we were doing this together,” and “It was exciting to have the opportunity to talk with so many healthcare organizations!”  Interviewers from the sites agreed, stating that there were great candidates who were very well prepared and that everything went smoothly and on time. One internship site “loved the format.”  A dozen organizations participated, which included Community Physician Network, CarDon & Associates, Eskenazi Health, The VA Medical Center, Together Homecare, Little Red Door Cancer Agency, Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, IN Immunization Coalition, IN 211, Golden Heart Health Services, Center for Health Policy – IUPUI, and Cancer Support Community.  Invitations have been sent to various internship sites for the next HSM Internship Interview Day, scheduled for February 28, 2020. If your organization is interested in participating in the future, this event is held every fall and spring semester. To be considered, please reach out to Sarah Johnson at shm@iu.edu . "

And if the answer is yes, than I would just recommend Health Services Management because of my experience and how I’ve grown in this program… I would love for someone else to grow the same amount that I’ve grown.  [Video: A female student, wearing a blue dress, stares into the distance and then walks on campus to different buildings and hospitals.]  [Words appear: Skyler, Student]  Kara: Seeing that you get to be a part of something larger than yourself is really rewarding and I think that being a part of this program helped you quickly see that the healthcare industry and all that it has to offer around us, could give that back to you.  [Video: Kara speaking, followed by Juan speaking]  Juan: You will be a huge part of what health care looks like 10 to 15 to 20 years from now. If you go into health services management.

[Indiana University Fairbanks School of Public Health at IUPUI](https://fsph.iupui.edu/index.html)  In collaboration with Dr. Virginia Caine of the Marion County Public Health Department, the Fairbanks School of Public Health expanded contact tracing in the city.  When a person tests positive for the novel coronavirus, a trained contact tracer will begin communicating with the infected individual to begin the process of tracing everyone with which they may have had close contact. Close contacts include those who were within six feet of the infected individual for at least 15 minutes. The tracking period begins after an individual has been exposed to an infected individual.   ### Contact  Our team can be reached at covidct@iupui.edu .  Contact Tracing FAQs   ### Contact tracing communications   #### Contact tracing scams  Contact tracers will not disclose to the public who may have exposed a person to COVID-19.

    "body": "  ## Alumni Spotlight: MHA Alumnus Installed as Indiana Regent at ACHE Congress  Kelly Braverman (MHA’02) assum ed the rol e of District 3 Regent for the American College of Healthcare Executives (ACHE) during the 2019 annual Congress on Healthcare Leadership held March 4-7 in Chicago. The Council of Regents is a non-governing body that promotes ACHE’s vision, mission, and values to the governance and its districts.  As regent, Braverman represents members of the Indiana Healthcare Executive Network (IHEN), the local chapter of ACHE. “The regent’s role is to help provide two-way communication between IHEN members  and the ACHE organization,” explains Braverman. “I will represent the members of IHEN to ACHE by sharing their interests and working to ensure they are aware of the programs offered by ACHE. I will also be a resource for individuals interested in learning more about what ACHE has to offer, or how to advance to fellow status.”  Braverman, who is president of Indiana University Health Frankfort Hospital, credits the MHA program for expanding her view of healthcare. “When I started the program, I had a pretty good idea of what my primary care physician did and what a hospital provided, but through the MHA program I learned that healthcare is a lot more diverse than that.”  Braverman acknowledges the program's role in teaching her the importance of policy and relationships with government officials to positively impact healthcare. “At Frankfort, I have had the opportunity to work closely with our county and city officials. The MHA program provided me insight and exposure that was very helpful.”  At IU Health, Braverman also oversees the Administrative Fellowship program—a  point of pride. “It’s a great opportunity to stay in touch with each new generation coming up,” she says.  Braverman encourages students to pursue a fellowship to gain practical experience that complements what they learn in the MHA program.  “Fellowships not only provide practical experience; they also allow the individual to have an understanding of what they like to do. Healthcare is so broad, which is one of the greatest things about this industry. By doing a fellowship, they have a little more time to figure out who they are and what they care about. An internship is a great start, but one summer does not necessarily provide adequate exposure, whereas most fellowships provide numerous opportunities via projects and rotations, with more time to grow and learn.”  Braverman challenges young graduates to pursue mentorship relationships less strictly and to be perpetual learners. “I have a lot of mentors, and some of them are colleagues. I may ask a colleague if they would put on a mentor hat for a minute and help me work through a challenge,” she says.  Braverman believes that, if nurtured effectively, those mentor relationships can develop beyond work scenarios and even provide advice regarding work-life balance and life in general.  “Those in the field must be willing to have a flexible and resilient attitude due to the ever-constant change in the healthcare field,” she says.  Braverman encourages fellows to focus on the reason they are in healthcare, which, for her, is to provide better outcomes for patients, including ways to make their healthcare more accessible and affordable, ultimately helping them become invested in improving their own health.

    "body": "  ## Alumni career profile: Kacie McGill  BSPH in Community Health, 2017  I came to IUPUI in 2013 in hopes of becoming an ultrasound technician. After my first semester, I considered switching my major but was unsure of which path to take. My advisor discussed the community health program at the Fairbanks School of Public Health with me and it caught my attention.  I admire the dedicated work that doctors, nurses, and healthcare facilitators do every day. Their field of work is essential. However, I feel that working in the field of public health has allowed me to impact larger amounts of individuals who need support.  Throughout my four years at IUPUI, I’ve taken numerous courses that display the need for more community health workers. I have obtained knowledge regarding social determinants of health, how nonprofits operate, and coaching for health behavior change.  I completed my summer internship at a local nonprofit that is called Healthy Communities of Clinton County Coalition. Healthy Communities has a coalition that meets once a month that works together to improve the overall well-being of Clinton County and other surrounding areas. It has several grants that are funded through different sources like March of Dimes and the Indiana State Health Department, and offers items like cribs, car seats, bicycles, tobacco cessation, and education for teen pregnancy prevention so that community members are able to make the healthy choice the easy choice.  I grew up in Clinton County and know the community very well, so I was extremely excited to be involved in improving the wellbeing of its members. After completing my internship, Healthy Communities then offered me a position at their organization!  I am now the tobacco prevention and cessation coordinator for Healthy Communities and the Baby & Me program facilitator. I work on reducing the burden of tobacco in Clinton County through policy implementation, offering cessation classes to lower adult tobacco use, and educating youth about the harm of using tobacco products. For the Baby & Me program, I assist pregnant women in quitting tobacco and also reducing secondhand smoke exposure to others.  Some members of our community can’t get resources that are vital to the safety of their family and themselves. I enjoy being able to help support individuals that might have little or no support at all.  Working at Healthy Communities has been a great opportunity and IUPUI’s community health program was extremely beneficial in preparing me for my career in public health.  I hope that future students are able to see how important community health work is. I want them to know that not only can doctors help reduce the burden of disease and improve the overall well-being of individuals, but community health workers can as well. People should know how good the feeling is of helping someone in need, even if it is with something as small as a car seat or crib.  Wondering what you can do with a public health degree? Through the BSPH in Community Health, students gain knowledge, research skills and hands-on domestic and international experience that prepares them to tackle real-world problems. With such high demand and potential job growth for professionals with health-related degrees, it is an exciting time to be in the public health sector. We’re currently facing extraordinary challenges, but we have the unique opportunity to transform the health of people in Indiana and beyond. Whether you’re interested in pre-medicine, pre-dentistry, or pre-nursing programs, or a health career not bound to just hospitals, our BSPH—Community Health program can help you get there.

    "body": "  ## HPM FAQs   ## How does the Health Policy and Management PhD program differ from other PhD programs? How is it the same?  Like other PhD programs, the PhD in HPM is a research-focused degree that provides students with in-depth training in interpreting scientific research, identifying important research questions, designing research studies, and applying sophisticated, often quantitative, research methods to answer research questions.  The PhD in HPM differs from other PhD programs, such as epidemiology, in that it trains students to ask different types of research questions. For example, researchers in HPM are interested in understanding how different laws, managerial strategies, or organizational structures affect things like access to healthcare, cost of healthcare, and quality of health care.  To answer these types of questions, HPM researchers are trained to apply relevant statistical and econometric methods to large datasets, often with the goal of inferring causal relationships. Similarly, HPM PhD students also obtain experience in acquiring and managing large datasets, such as those from surveys, insurance claims, or electronic health records.   ## What kind of jobs will the Health Policy and Management PhD program prepare students for?  The HPM PhD program is best suited for students interested in academic careers in health policy and management. In other words, the program prepares students to become faculty members in departments of health policy and management or similar departments. Similar departments may be called “health services research,” “health services administration,” or something else.  To prepare students for academic jobs, the program provides students with training and experiences in reading, interpreting, writing, critiquing, developing, executing, and publishing peer-reviewed academic research. The program will also provide students with sufficient training and experience in teaching so they can be competitive for faculty jobs that involve teaching and research. The aforementioned training will also prepare students for research-oriented jobs in non-academic settings, such as government agencies or private research firms.   ## What kind of jobs will the HPM PhD program NOT prepare students for?  The HPM PhD program will not prepare students to be administrative leaders in healthcare delivery organizations, such as hospitals. If you are interested in the “doing” of management rather than “thinking” about how to design research studies, collect data, and analyze data that may inform practice, consider the Master of Health Administration degree. Similarly, the HPM PhD program will not prepare students to be public health administrators, business consultants, or policymakers.   ## Do HPM PhD students have the option of enrolling full-time or part-time?  Yes, the program can be completed on a full-time or part-time basis. However, full-time applicants are preferred. PhD training requires a significant time commitment to coursework, research collaborations, peer interactions, and mentorship. Therefore, only exceptional part-time students with flexible schedules will be considered. In particular, the program expects the following minimum commitment from part-time students to ensure their successful development as an HPM researcher.   ## Can I transfer graduate course credits to the HPM PhD program?  The PhD in HPM is a distinct degree from other degrees, including a Master of Public Health (MPH). Therefore, it is expected that students will transfer very few or no credits. However, once accepted, students may request to have courses transferred from another accredited university or program if they received a grade of \"B\" or better in the courses. The HPM PhD program director and faculty will review and approve or deny requests for transfer. Requests are evaluated on a case by case basis.   ## Is the HPM PhD program offered online?  No. A very limited number of courses may be offered online.   ## Is financial support available for students in the HPM PhD program?  For full-time students only, the program will typically provide funding support in the form of tuition remission, a stipend to cover living expenses, and health insurance. This support typically requires a 20 hour per week work assignment.   ## How much are tuition and fees for the Health Policy and Management (HPM) PhD program?  Tuition and fees are $510 per credit hour for in-state students and $1,250 for both out-of-state and international students.   ## I would like to meet with the HPM PhD program director. Is that possible?  Yes, contact Mary Beth Ryan to schedule an appointment.   ## What is the application deadline for HPM PhD program?  Applicants will be reviewed as they are received, and decisions may be made on a rolling basis. The application deadline to receive priority for financial support is January 5. However, applications will be accepted through May 1 (April 1 for international students).   ## How many students do you admit each year?  The number of students admitted each year varies and typically ranges between two and four.   ## When are admissions decisions made?  Applications for the HPM PhD program will be reviewed by the program's admissions committee after the priority application deadline and then as they are received.   ## How are admissions decisions made?  A committee of faculty from the HPM department reviews applications to assess each candidate’s:  Potential to excel in PhD coursework  Commitment to research-focused degree program  Interest in a research career  Fit with the HPM program and faculty in terms of research interests  Follow the committee review, top candidates will be invited for an interview (in person, phone, or video-conference) to further assess their candidacy.   ## What are the minimum requirements for admission?  Admission to the HPM PhD program requires completion of a baccalaureate degree, although it is anticipated that many applicants will have completed a post baccalaureate degree. Other minimum admission requirements include:   ## I have graduate degree, and I took the GRE before being admitted to that program. Do I have to take the GRE again?  GRE scores, while not required for admission, if you plan to attend the PhD program as a full-time funded student, you are strongly encouraged to submit GRE scores with your application, since some funding sources require current GRE scores (less than five years old) in order for students to be eligible.   ## How do I apply for admission?  Applicants must apply through the SOPHAS system. SOPHAS is the centralized Schools of Public Health Application Service. Paper applications are not accepted.  [SOPHAS](https://sophas.aspph.org/)   ## In addition to applying for SOPHAS, will I also need to apply to IUPUI?  Yes, in addition to applying to SOPHAS, all applicants will be required to complete an abbreviated application to the IUPUI Online Graduate and Professional Admissions Application system, accessible through the link provided in the SOPHAS application.   ## Where should my recommendation letters be sent?  You will be asked to submit email addresses for your recommenders as part of the SOPHAS online application.

In addition to completing the online application, the following documents should be submitted to SOPHAS:   ## What is the application cost?  Please check with SOPHAS for current application costs.  [SOPHAS](https://sophas.aspph.org/)   ## How can I check on my application status?  You will receive notification via email when we have received your application from SOPHAS.   ## Are GRE subject tests required?  No, GRE subject tests are not required.   ## Can I send photocopies of my test scores?  No, photocopies are not sufficient. Official test scores are required and must go to SOPHAS directly from the testing service. If you have scores from testing services other than ETS (GRE), contact them to find out if they submit scores to SOPHAS. If they do not, you may have them sent to IUPUI.   ## If I applied for or graduated from another graduate program at Indiana University, do I have to have my test scores sent from the testing service again?  Yes, you must have your test scores sent to SOPHAS.   ## I have degrees and/or coursework from Indiana University. Do I need to have my IU transcripts sent to apply for a PhD program?  Yes, you must have your transcripts sent to SOPHAS.   ## If I have a master's degree from an American university, do I have to submit scores for the TOEFL exam?  A bachelor's or higher degree from a country designated by IUPUI as predominantly native-English speaking is required to exempt you from taking the TOEFL exam or providing other acceptable proof of English proficiency. For more information, please visit iapply.iupui.edu .  [iapply.iupui.edu](http://iapply.iupui.edu/graduate/toefl-exemption)   ## I would like to know if my degree is the equivalent of an American university B.A. or B.S. degree. Can you tell me if I can be admitted with my current degree?  The SOPHAS application system requires a World Education Services (WES) ICAP course-by-course evaluation for all post-secondary foreign institutions attended. The admissions committee will use this document to guide them in their decisions for international students. When the committee recommends admission for an international applicant, IUPUI’s Office of International Affairs will conduct their own evaluation to finalize the admission process.   ## Can I begin a PhD program in the spring semester?  If accepted students are expected to matriculate in the fall semester. In special circumstances other arrangements may be possible.   ## I was accepted to the HPM PhD program. Now what?  Once accepted, your main points of contact are the HPM PhD program director, Justin Blackburn , and the PhD program student services coordinator, Shawne Mathis . Feel free to reach out to them with any questions.   ## Is housing provided by the university?  The on-campus housing options include campus apartments, residence halls, and townhomes.  [Explore IUPUI housing options](https://housing.iupui.edu/index.html)   ## How do I register for classes?  Students register for classes online. Registration details will be sent to all admitted students over the summer.   ## Is it necessary for me to take the English Placement test?  Applicants providing proof of a score 100 or higher on the TOEFL exam, or 7.5 on the IELTS exam are exempt from the requirement to take the EAP exam at IUPUI. Applicants with scores lower than these levels are required to take the English for Academic Purposes (EAP) exam. Note that this test is for students who have students who have been accepted and enrolled. It is not an application requirement.  [See further information on the EAP](https://liberalarts.iupui.edu/departments/english/?)   ## Is there a time limit for courses that may be applied toward a HPM PhD program?  IU Graduate School policy states all coursework for the PhD needs to be completed within the seven years prior to passing the program’s qualifying exam.   ## How long do I have to complete the PhD program?

The company matches students with the fastest-growing tech companies for a unique, immersive experience.  \" I was really looking for new career opportunities to put my education to use,\" Kyle said. \"I have learned so many great things through the Health Data Science program [and] was ecstatic to put that knowledge to use in a business setting.\"  At ClusterTruck, Kyle used analytical skills to conduct exploratory data analysis, looking for key insights that affect business decisions. He monitored the performance of existing machine learning models to ensure accurate predictions, and helped with the organization's day-to-day business intelligence needs through query and/or dashboard development.  Many of the skills he used during the internship were a direct result of the courses he'd taken in the HDS program.  \"The programming and statistical methods I learned in the first two health data science classes impressed my employers,\" Kyle said. \"Even in the first few weeks, I was surprised at how many techniques I could apply at my internship that I obtained from my first two classes.\"  The hackathons hosted within the HDS program have also helped Kyle, opening his eyes to many tools and exciting technologies that he now uses day-to-day. While he had much to offer his team at ClusterTruck, he believes the internship also gave him something in return.  \"I believe my internship has given me so many things. When starting the internship, I was only vaguely familiar with the programming languages SQL and python. (By the end), I was able to evaluate a machine learning model that was built in python.\"  Kyle enjoyed gaining experience with python as it was something on his list of things to learn. Additionally, he gained so much experience with SQL that he can now write SQL queries that allow him to extract the exact type of data needed for any given analysis.  \"ClusterTruck has further confirmed my aspirations and excitement to pursue the path of being a great data scientist.\"  To learn more about Kyle's internship, watch a short video about his experience .

    "body": "  ## Mother-Daughter MHA Alumni Create Legacy of Health Administration Leaders  Although mother-daughter duo, Kathleen McAllen and Erin Winders earned their master of health administration degrees decades apart, they are both attracted to the field for the same reasons.  Kathleen chose the MHA program after switching her original plan to attend medical school. “I loved biology and chemistry in high school and went to Purdue with plans to go to medical school,” she said. “I got to my sophomore year and realized that likely wasn’t the plan for me, but completed my studies.”  To Kathleen, the MHA degree seemed like a great way to be in health sciences, as the business aspect of it aligned better with her gifts and passion. In 1990, she graduated within the School of Public and Environmental Affairs at IUPUI with her MHA.  “I couldn’t have picked a better path – I have loved my career and have been blessed with so many opportunities.”  Over the past 30 years, Kathleen’s career has blossomed. She has served in a wide variety of leadership roles at both Bloomington Hospital and Community Health Network. Today, she is the Chief Strategy Officer for the Giving Hope Foundation, a non-profit organization whose mission is to create a first-generation delivery model of comprehensive and integrated health and related services to individuals with unique physical, intellectual, and emotional needs. She is also adjunct faculty at the Fairbanks School of Public Health, teaching healthcare information management this past semester.  A true advocate of the field, Kathleen steered her daughter, Erin, in the direction of health administration when her daughter decided to expand her career.  “I was thrilled and honored when Erin, mostly on her own – with maybe a little persuasion – came to agree that an MHA is a perfect blend of where the helping profession meets business,” Kathleen said. “Health care does and can, all the more, benefit from strong women leaders, especially at the senior - executive levels.”  Erin had reached a point in her career where she needed to further her education to increase her career options. She had always been interested in healthcare, but much like her mother, she wasn’t sure of which direction to take. “I thought I wanted to work directly with patients and quickly found out this was not my forte,” Erin said.  Luckily having watched her mom throughout the years, she knew of an alternate route. “Without my mom’s past, I don’t think I would’ve heard about an MHA degree, so I’m very thankful for her push in the right direction.” Erin said. “Healthcare administration has been the perfect fit for my skills, interests and abilities.”  Erin excelled as a student in the MHA program and was most proud of the fundraiser for Gennesaret Free Clinics that was part of a first year vs. second year student competition to see who could raise the most amount of money to purchase socks for the homeless of central Indiana.  “Between both classes, we raised about $800, which is amazing! I was so proud of our program,” she said.  While in the MHA program, Erin also served as president for the MHA Student Association. She found out she was expecting a baby the day after she was elected, and said her classmates were both encouraging and understanding of her situation.  “I was missing in action for a bit of time during labor and maternity leave, and my fellow team really picked up the pieces for me during this time,” Erin said.  Erin remained dedicated throughout her program, making time to accompany her mom to various events. “We’ve often attended networking events together, which has been fun and helpful. I tend to get nervous, so it’s nice to have a partner by my side.”  A partner indeed, Kathleen says she has long been committed to mentoring fellow health leaders, reflecting on the influence that the late Roland (Bud) Kohr had on her. Kohr was CEO of Bloomington Hospital for over 30 years and a pillar in the health administration community.  “My first boss and life-long mentor, Roland Kohr, taught me early and well that our work is a calling, a noble profession,” Kathleen explained.  “I have strived to live that out in my 30+ years and share that approach with those I've had the privilege of helping to develop.”  During the Fairbanks School of Public Health commencement ceremony this spring, Kathleen had another opportunity to inspire future healthcare leaders, including her daughter Erin, who was a graduate of this year’s MHA program.  “It is always about the patients and their families – if we serve them well, all other aspects will be right. Not easy, but right,” said Kathleen during her commencement speech.  Kathleen is now embarking on a new path of service she is excited to see unfold. In 2017, she cofounded Healthcare of Tomorrow, a healthcare incubator that strives to radically improve healthcare by building a collaborative platform of innovation – connecting entrepreneurs, investors, and healthcare providers.  “I am inspired by my mom on multiple levels,” Erin said. “I’m proud to share the same interests as her – we are a great team. We get along so well, and now she is a Grandma (Gigi) – so we love hanging out!”  Kathleen is a proud “Gigi” and hopes to encourage her seven-month-old granddaughter, Leigh Ann Rae, and others – especially women leaders – to reach for their dreams.

    "body": "  ## Eskenazi Health Scholars Program  The federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality recently awarded a large grant to Joshua Vest, PhD, Associate Professor of Health Policy and Management and Director of the Center for Health Policy, to study the use and effectiveness of alternative methods of electronically sharing information in primary care settings. This will be the first study of its kind.  The United States has invested billions on interoperable health information technologies, but there is very little evidence of health information exchange's effects on utilization and on how it is used in primary care practice, said Vest.  According to Vest, providers have access to two different health information exchange approaches to meet their information needs.  One approach is referred to as \"pull,\" which allows providers to query communitywide, longitudinal patient records. A second approach is \"push,\" where key information, such as test results, is automatically delivered to providers.  There is a lack of evidence of the effectiveness of either the \"push\" or \"pull\" approach, Vest said. \"Furthermore, which approach to sharing information best fits into primary care is unknown,\" he said.  One objective of the study is to determine whether primary care providers use \"push\" and \"pull\" as complementary or alternative approaches to health information exchange, Vest said. The study will leverage a novel data set of individual provider and staff behavior tracked within an electronic health record system, combined with detailed measures of \"push\" and \"pull\" health information exchange usage.  \"These data furnish a complete, detailed temporal sequence of providers' behavior, revealing how each approach to health information exchange is used during a patient visit,\" Vest said.  The study will also quantify the effect of \"push\" and \"pull\" health information exchange on potentially avoidable health care utilization, he said.  The Center for Health Policy works closely with local health systems and Indiana state agencies to address the health issues in our state and beyond. "

    "body": "  ## New Career Outing Initiative Gives Students Early Exposure to Health Administration  The Department of Health Policy and Management at the IU Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health has held three career outings this year for students in the health services management undergraduate program. These outings have given students an opportunity to explore various healthcare settings and learn more about possible health administration careers in those settings.  Students had a chance to visit Riverview Health in October, St. Vincent Hospital in November, and Miller’s Merry Manor in February. For one student, the visit to Miller’s surpassed her expectations and inspired her to apply for their Administrator-in-Training program.  “As a senior and current Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA), long-term care has been a top career choice for me for a while now,” said current health services management student, Sabrina Wardwell, pictured above (right) with health services management student, Taylor Walters (left). “When the opportunity came to visit one of Miller’s locations here in Indianapolis, I was excited to attend and learn from current administrators and leaders about their experiences in the industry.”  Sabrina was one of twenty students to attend the outing, the majority of which were juniors and seniors gearing up for the full-time job search or the summer internship hunt.  “We were greeted warmly by a team of Miller’s leaders, including the location administrator, a regional manager, the retiring chief operations officer and the incoming chief operations officer,” she said.  During the outing, students learned about the organization’s history, mission and values, as well as the ins and outs of a career in long-term care.  “As each person spoke, it was clear that they were really passionate about what they do for a living,” Sabrina said. “They didn’t shy away from the challenges of the field, but they also emphasized the rewarding aspects of a career in this industry.”  Following the conversational portion of the outing, the students broke into smaller groups for tours of the Indianapolis East location.  “We toured the rehabilitation gym, greeted patients, walked the wings, chatted with employees in the memory care unit, and got a feel for the rhythm of the place.”  Sabrina is planning for a career as a long-term care administrator, and was particularly excited when the team told her about Miller’s Administrator-in-Training (AIT) program.  “This six-to-eight month program that prepares you for the role and the licensing exam is exactly what I want to do next,” she said. “I am excited to be considered for an on-campus interview at IUPUI in March for their next round of AIT recruitment. I am confident that my experience on this career outing has better prepared me for that upcoming interview and helped me solidify that long-term care is the right career path for me.”  The Department of Health Policy and Management is looking forward to their final career outing of the academic year in April, and is currently setting the schedule for next year. If you would like to host a group of students on an outing, reach out to Sarah Johnson at shm@iu.edu . "

    "body": "  ## Issue Briefs  Please contact fsphinfo@iupui.edu to obtain information contained in the documents below in an accessible format.   ### The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Behavioral Health in Indiana  June 2021  As of January 2021, the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center has confirmed more than 20 million SARS-CoV-2 cases and over 350,000 deaths in the United States alone and 100 million cases and more than 2 million deaths globally. As of December 31, 2020, over half a million Hoosiers had tested positive for COVID-19 and more than 8,000 had died as a result of complications from the disease. This report is a review on the impact the COVID-19 pandemic had (and has) on the mental and behavioral health of Hoosiers. Specifically, we reviewed pandemic-related stress on children, parents, and the elderly; substance use, misuse, and overdose deaths; mental health concerns; suicide; domestic violence; and child abuse and neglect.  The current report is a summary of findings. It provides a snapshot in time. Data and conclusions were relevant and timely at the time the report was produced.   ### Marijuana Use in Indiana: A Look at Cannabis Laws in and around Indiana  April 2020  Though under federal law marijuana is still considered an illicit drug, many states have enacted policies decriminalizing and/or legalizing marijuana to some degree. In 14 states (including Indiana), possession, use, cultivation, sale or distribution of marijuana is illegal.  Indiana is bordered by states with varying marijuana policies: Kentucky (illegal), Ohio (medical use), and Michigan and Illinois (medical and recreational use). One emerging trend of concern is the use of marijuana products (THC) in e-cigarettes, especially among young people.   ### Vaping Among Indiana Youth  March 2020  The U.S. Surgeon General and other public health officials have described the use of e-cigarettes, or vaping, by young people as an epidemic. E-cigarettes are electronic devices that heat a liquid (called e-liquid) typically containing nicotine, flavoring, and other chemicals to produce an aerosol that is inhaled by a user. Although nicotine is the most common drug that young people vape, vaping marijuana is also increasing in popularity.  Although the long-term health effects of vaping are not currently known, e-cigarettes do pose a number of risks to young people. First, the use of e-cigarettes serves as a gateway to future combustible cigarette use. Second, because most e-liquid contains nicotine and because the adolescent brain is particularly sensitive to nicotine, the use of e-cigarette products places young people at heightened risk for nicotine dependence. Third, the chemicals contained in e-liquid have never been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for inhalation.   ### Suicide Prevention  January 2020  Suicide, or intentional self-harm, is one of the leading causes of death in the United States. Suicide rates among Hoosiers have increased from 12.6 per 100,000 in 2008 to 16.3 per 100,000 in 2017, a nearly 30 percent increase over the 10-year period. One in 10 Indiana high school students attempted and survived suicide; those who identified as gay, lesbian, or bisexual had significantly higher rates of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors compared to students who identified as heterosexual. A variety of factors contribute to a person’s likelihood to engage in suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Though anyone can be affected by suicide, there are some groups within the population that are at a particularly high risk due to the stresses they experience.  The purpose of this report is to provide an overview of suicide risks, trends, and current interventions in Indiana. To accomplish this, we (1) reviewed the literature and existing data, (2) conducted key informant interviews with state experts, and (3) synthesized the information to provide recommendations for suicide prevention.   ### Social Determinants of Health and Their Impact on Mental Health and Substance Misuse  January 2020  Health and wellbeing are shaped by many factors beyond healthcare and behavioral choices, including conditions that make up our social, economic, and physical environments. These factors are often referred to as social determinants of health (SDoHs). SDoHs not only affect our physical health, but they also can have an impact on a person’s mental wellbeing and substance use.  These social determinants of health can be grouped into five major categories:  To address SDoHs effectively, a “health in all policies” approach that integrates health considerations into policymaking across sectors is essential.   ### Drug Use in Indiana: A Regional Perspective  May 2019  Indiana consists of 92 counties, which can be divided into 8 service regions. The prevalence of substance misuse can differ between the individual regions. Compared to the state’s average, rates of underage drinking, smoking, and illicit drug use were particularly high in Indiana’s Western region.  The most frequently used substances among Indiana students in grades 8, 10, and 12 were alcohol, electronic vape products, marijuana, traditional (combustible) cigarettes, and prescription drugs. Understanding each region’s unique needs is a vital component to designing programs dedicated to improving overall Hoosier health.   ### Medicated-Assisted Treatment in Indiana  March 2019  Opioid misuse and addiction continues to affect many Americans. Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) using methadone, buprenorphine, or extended-release naltrexone in combination with behavioral therapy is the most effective intervention for opioid use disorders (OUDs). Despite its effectiveness, methadone to treat OUDs is not widely available. Buprenorphine is more accessible, as it can be prescribed by medical doctors, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants who have received specialized training and obtained a waiver from the DEA. Naltrexone is a non-narcotic and can be prescribed by any healthcare professional who has prescription privileges.   ### Recovering from Substance Use Disorders: A Case for Peer Recovery Coaches  January 2019  Peer recovery coaches (PRCs) are resources that are being increasingly utilized in the treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs). The role of a PRC is to act as mentor, guide, and role model to those with an SUD by providing a range of support services.  The overall body of evidence suggests that PRCs can be effective; however, barriers to the widespread utilization of the peer-recovery approach still exist.   ### The Impact of Parental Incarceration on  Children’s Health & Development  December 2018  The incarceration boom in the United States has resulted in high rates of parents serving time. According to recent estimates, one in 10 Hoosier children has a parent who is or has been in prison or jail. Though incarceration is often treated as a discrete event, it is important to note that the time period extends both prior to and beyond the incarcerated phase (pre- and post-incarceration). Evidence on the relationship between parental incarceration and various children’s outcomes is inconsistent across the literature and often disappears when controlling for demographic and family characteristics. However, whether the relationship between parental incarceration and children’s health and development is causal or simply correlational, this population is at high risk for adverse outcomes and should be the target of interventions.   ### Opioid Overdoses in Indiana: A Closer Look at Opioid Type  June 2018  The misuse of prescription and illicit opioids remains at epidemic proportions, costing the United States billions of dollars annually. Overdose deaths in both the U.S. and Indiana have seen a dramatic increase over the past ten years. Until recently, prescription opioids were responsible for the greatest number of overdose deaths, but now have been surpassed by fatalities involving heroin and illicitly manufactured narcotics, primarily fentanyl.   ### Mental Health, Substance Misuse, and Suicide: Shared Risk and Protective Factors  June 2018  Mental illness, substance misuse, and suicide are complex conditions with serious public health implications. Evidence suggests that these disorders often co-occur and share many of the same risk and protective factors. Additionally, certain populations are at an increased risk of developing substance use disorders, mental illness, or engaging in suicidal behaviors. Nationally and in Indiana, several factors, including stigma, an undersized mental health workforce, and limited treatment options, inhibit the effective identification and treatment of these conditions.   ### Community Conditions Favorable for Substance Abuse  April 2018  The probability of whether an individual engages in substance use is associated with several risk and protective factors. Effective prevention requires understanding these factors. The social-ecological model considers the complex interactions between individual, relationship, community, and societal factors. This can help us understand substance use in a public health context and design strategies to address the problem across multiple levels.   ### Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and their Impact on Substance Misuse & Overall Health  March 2018  Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) encompass a wide variety of distressing events, including emotional, physical, or sexual abuse; witnessing maternal domestic violence; or living with a household member who has a substance use disorder, is mentally ill or suicidal, or is currently or was ever incarcerated during the first 18 years of a child’s life. According to most recent estimates, nearly half of Indiana’s youth have experienced at least one ACE in their life. ACEs are linked to many risk behaviors, including substance use, which can adversely affect health outcomes.   ### Polypharmacy Among Prescription Drug Users  August 2017  Polypharmacy, i.e., the misuse of multiple prescription drugs or prescription medication with other substances, is highly problematic. Whether unintentional or deliberate, misuse of multiple drugs can lead to adverse effects including addiction; drug-drug interactions; and overdose, potentially resulting in death. Polypharmacy is not uncommon; almost 84 percent of prescription drug misusers receiving substance abuse treatment in Indiana reported using at least one additional substance, most commonly alcohol or marijuana.   ### The Impact of Substance Use on the Developing Brain  July 2017  Most peoples’ first exposure to alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs typically occurs during adolescence, a time when the brain changes rather dramatically.  The maturation process of the adolescent brain is reflected in a greater propensity to take part in risky activities such as unprotected sex, reckless driving, and substance use. Alcohol, nicotine, and marijuana, the most commonly used substances by teens, have all been tied to disruptions in normal brain development. These structural changes are associated with higher rates of cognitive impairments and academic difficulties, higher rates of future substance use and substance use disorders, and higher rates of mood and psychotic disorders.   ### Substance Abuse in Indiana - An Urban-Rural Perspective  June 2017  The use of alcohol and drugs is a significant public health problem in the United States. Indiana, like many other states in the nation, is lacking in substance abuse treatment services and rural areas are particularly underserved. Rural residents may encounter additional barriers to receiving substance abuse treatment, including stigma, fear that they may know their treatment providers, a lack of access to specialized services, inferior quality of care, and having to pay more for treatment.   ### Substance Abuse Trends in Indiana: A 10-Year Perspective  April 2017  Substance use is a significant public health problem in the United States. Excessive use of alcohol and drugs has been linked to increased morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular conditions; injuries and motor vehicle crashes; sexually transmitted and blood-borne illnesses, including HIV/AIDS and hepatitis B and C, resulting from risky sexual behaviors and/or injection drug use; pregnancy complications and neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS); and drug overdoses [5, 6].   ### Treatment & Recovery for Substance Use Disorders in Indiana  October 2016  Substance abuse is a significant public health concern. When drug or alcohol use regularly causes a person substantial life consequences, he/she has likely transitioned from occasional, potentially problematic, use to having a substance use disorder (SUD). In 2014, almost half a million Hoosiers (8.5%) met the criteria for SUD.   ### Overview of Suicide Risk Among Adolescent Hispanic Girls in Indiana  April 2016  Suicide is one of the leading causes of death among adolescents in the United States and in Indiana. Suicide is a complex public health issue, and common risk factors include problems with mental health, substance use, physical injury and psychological trauma. In addition, social and cultural differences can place certain racial and ethnic groups at especially high risk of thoughts and behaviors that may lead to suicide.   ### Behavioral Health Disparities in Indiana  February 2016  The burden of illness, premature death, and disability is distributed unequally throughout the nation, leading to vast differences in health status or outcomes between specific groups. Such health disparities are persistent and occur across a wide range of physical and behavioral conditions.   ### Injection Drug Use in Indiana: A Major Risk for HIV Transmission  January 2016  Illicit drug use is a significant public health issue. In 2014, approximately 27 million people, or 10.2 percent of the United States population 12 years of age or older, were currently using some type of illicit substance, while 7.1 million people 12 years of age or older could be classified as either abusing or being dependent on an illicit drug.   ### Substance Use Among Young Adults in Indiana Who Are Not Enrolled in College  September 2015  The primary purpose of this study was to gather information on patterns and trends of substance use; reasons for using (or not using); and perceptions and beliefs regarding substance use within one’s social circle (peers) from our target population, i.e., Indiana residents ages 18 to 25 who do not attend, nor have graduated from, college.   ### Indiana Syringe Exchange Program  August 2015  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), “syringe exchange programs provide free sterile syringes and collect used syringes from injection-drug users to reduce transmission of blood borne pathogens, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus.” Such an approach falls under the category of public health prevention known as “harm reduction,” which aim to minimize disease spread and injury (to the individual and to others) associated with high risk behaviors.   ### Indicators of Mental Health in Children and Adolescents in Indiana  July 2015  Mental health disorders among children and adolescents are an important public health issue across the United States. Many of our youth are suffering from mood, anxiety, behavior, and substance use disorders with onsets occurring as early as age 6; unfortunately, several do not receive treatment until years later.   ### Ebola Virus Disease - Legal and Ethical Considerations for Indiana  October 2014  The Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), formally known as Ebola hemorrhagic fever, is a virulent and often deadly infectious disease. Fatality rates for the disease have reported to be as high as 90% following contraction. As of October 14, 2014, a total of 8,914 probable, confirmed, and suspected cases of  EVD and 4,447 deaths due to the disease, have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) by the nations of Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leon.   ### Using Data to Identify Substance Abuse Prevention Needs - Development of a Substance Abuse Priority Index (SAPI)  May 2013  Substance abuse continues to be a public health concern in Indiana and nationwide. The abuse of alcohol and other drugs may not only result in negative health outcomes but are often a key issue in the criminal justice system, either directly (e.g., possession or sale/ manufacture of illicit substances) or indirectly (e.g., crimes com- mitted while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or to support drug-seeking behaviors). The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declared substance abuse stance abuse can differ by county.   ### Opioid Treatment Programs in Indiana - The Use of Medication in Addiction Treatment  January 2013  Addiction to opioids (e.g., heroin, morphine, prescription pain relievers) is a serious health problem with wide-ranging social and economic implications. In 2010, more than 2 million Americans were affected, with 1.9 million U.S. residents addicted to prescription opioids and 359,000 addicted to heroin. Abuse of opioids, particularly heroin, has been associated with unintentional overdoses and transmission of hepatitis, HIV, and sexually transmitted diseases.   ### Prenatal Alcohol Use and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder in Indiana  June 2012  Consumption of alcohol during pregnancy can cause the infant to be born with a fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). FASD is not a diagnosis, but an umbrella term that describes a group of conditions associated with prenatal alcohol exposure, including fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) [6].   ### The Effects of Tobacco Use on Oral Health in Indiana  July 2010  Tobacco use is associated with a variety of harmful consequences, including increased risk of numerous cancers; coronary heart disease and other cardiovascular diseases; respiratory diseases in adults and children; and pregnancy complications. In addition, tobacco use imposes a considerable economic burden, accounting for $190 billion annually in healthcare expenditures and productivity losses [3].   ### Meth Use in Indiana  July 2010  Methamphetamine, a derivative of amphetamine, is a synthetic stimulant that affects the central nervous system. It is commonly known as meth, speed, and chalk; in its smoked form, it is often referred to as ice, crystal, crank, and glass [1]. Due to its high potential for abuse, meth is classified as a Schedule II drug and is legally available only by prescription [2]. Abuse of the drug is a serious problem in the United States, often resulting in devastating medical, psychological, social, and legal consequences. According to estimates from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 12.6 million Americans (or 5.0 percent) ages 12 and older have tried meth at least once in their life [3]. "

    "body": "  ## Alumni Career Profile: Christine Krieger  BS in Health Services Management, 2017 Minor in Human Resources Current Title: Service Center Representative Current Employer: JWM Neurology  Christine decided to major in Health Services Management because she wanted to provide care for others in a non-traditional way.  “Most people think healthcare and immediately ‘doctor’ or ‘nurse’ comes to mind. What people don’t realize is, while that’s true, the healthcare field encompasses more than just that. Being an HSM student allowed me to see healthcare from various perspectives and how it is more than just seeing a provider.”  Christine says the lessons she learned from group projects during the Bachelor of Science in Health Services Management (BSHSM) program, have not left her. In fact, much of what she learned helps her navigate the role of service center representative for JWM Neurology in which she’s responsible for addressing patients’ questions and concerns.  In my line of work, I am constantly interacting with various personalities and being able to cooperate with them is critical for success. Being able to critically think through difficult situations is also something I have to do on a daily basis with patients.  From healthcare laws and regulations, to ethical conduct and professionalism, Christine values what she’s learned both inside and outside the classroom.  “Leadership experience, for me, wasn’t gained in the classroom but through involvement in campus organizations.”  Naturally introverted, addressing others and speaking out was never Christine’s forte, but she gradually gained confidence and found herself mentoring her fellow colleagues and being the one others sought out during distress. To this day, she continues to serve happily as an alumni advisor to these campus organizations.  At JWM, Christine is responsible for scheduling for more than 40 providers of neurological care at eight offices throughout the Indianapolis area. She started in this position immediately after completing the HSM program, and this is just the beginning for her.  “Long term, my goal is to be a health promoter/educator for high risk populations.”  Christine would love to be able to coordinate education programs and facilities to better serve, educate and improve the health status of high risk populations.

The program served 211 long-term care facilities throughout Indiana.  Phase I of the program included 16 weekly sessions designed specifically to assist with the most pressing COVID-related needs. Phase II consisted of weekly sessions comprised of three cohorts aimed at stopping the spread, vaccinations, supporting needs of residents and families, and leadership behaviors to support nursing home teams. This ECHO program was geared specifically for nursing home leadership to build capacity related to COVID-19 and protect residents and staff. Nursing facilities that joined the interactive community of practice worked to advance improvements in COVID-19 preparedness, safety, and infection control.   ### Goals  Our goal was to help nursing homes implement evidence-based best practices to:   ### Approach  This initiative operated as a 16-week interactive virtual community of practice utilizing the ECHO model. The ECHO model uses complex ideas and guided mentorship to provide an “all teach, all learn” environment. The weekly sessions were designed to create space to hear directly from nursing home staff about the challenges that they faced through discussion of real cases. All participants were encouraged to share best practices and learn from their peers – while benefiting from the guidance of nursing home and quality improvement experts.   ### Partners   ### Questions  For questions and more information, please contact the ECHO project management specialist, Caroline Kryder-Reid at ckryderr@iu.edu "

    "body": "  ## Alumni Spotlight: MHA Alumnus Now President and COO of Ascension  After Joseph Impicciche (JD’83, MHA’91) completed his law degree at IU, he began to work for Hall Render Heath Killian and Lyman where he was first exposed to healthcare law. His tenure in the firm inspired him to pursue a Master of Health Administration (MHA).  Impicciche fondly remembers how the program helped teach him the value of learning to work with others in teams and groups.  “Unlike the law degree, which is just all solo, in the MHA program most classes had group projects which required deliverables from the team,” said Impicciche.  Impicciche describes this experience as his first chance at learning how to allocate work responsibilities among team members and exercising leadership skills in new ways. He believes that the lessons students gain in these group projects teach individual accountability and leadership skills, which are valuable and transferrable in the workplace.  Outside of the classroom, Impicciche encourages students to diversify their experiences to help them gain skills and proficiencies that help them reach their career goals. He said that “Healthcare is rapidly changing, and the historical model of providing healthcare is quickly disappearing. It’s becoming more retail oriented and digitized.”  The new model challenges healthcare leaders to consider ways to serve patients where they live, and to utilize technology in new ways to provide services and meet patient needs. Impicciche believes that young leaders who have backgrounds in consumerism, digital platforms, and retail medicine will add value to the healthcare industry.  In January 2019, Impicciche assumed the role of President and Chief Operating Officer for Ascension.  He is excited about this new role and says he intends to rely heavily on the MHA education he received from IUPUI in this position.  Previously, he served as General Counsel at Ascension since 2004. Earlier he was a partner at Hall Render Health Killian and Lyman, where he concentrated on public finance, business and tax law for nonprofit organizations. He then served as General Counsel for Ascension’s St. Vincent Health in Indianapolis. "

    "body": "  ## St. Vincent Heart Center President Blake Dye Encourages Aspiring Health Administration Leaders  Having an internal medicine physician and a cardiologist as a father, Blake A. Dye was often encouraged to become a physician. Yet, the thought of becoming a doctor did not appeal to him. It was witnessing his father’s unique relationship with hospital administration and the rewards of being in healthcare that ultimately inspired Dye, leading him to pursue a career in healthcare administration. He received his BS in Public Health with a concentration in Health Administration in 1979 and his MS in Health Administration in 1981, both from what is now the IU Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health at IUPUI.  One semester before graduating with his MSHA, he began working in human resources at Henry County Hospital where he served for 31 years in various roles, including more than a decade as the president and chief executive officer. He thinks fondly of his role as the Director of Human Resources at Henry County Hospital and recommends that everyone begins their career as a healthcare administrator in HR.  “Having a solid understanding of pay practices, people and the legalities of human resources is extremely important,” Dye said.  For the past seven years, he has served as the president of the St. Vincent Heart Center of Indiana and as the Statewide Executive of the Cardiovascular Service Line. Dye acknowledges that a career in healthcare is extremely challenging but that the relationships built with colleagues and serving patients make it an extremely rewarding career.  “It’s an awesome responsibility,” Dye said. “In any given day, it humbles you to think about serving individuals in a life and death situation.” This awesome responsibility has transformed throughout his career, which is why he highlights the need for practicing individuals to enter the field understanding that change and uncertainty will occur throughout their professional lives.  He also encourages future leaders to have a strong understanding of data analytics. As a self-proclaimed, late careerist, Dye highlighted that data analytics is a skillset that he needed to master mid-career. Leaders need to analyze data and be able to put it into the process improvement arena.  Emphasizing that his professional relationships helped him master this skillset, he encourages others to rely on their peers and to be a good peer.  “This is a relationship business,” he said. “Learn everything you can from individuals who are steadfast rocks in the industry. Talk around, look around and try to get an audience with individuals that are rocks in the industry, whether they are in Indiana, Ohio or Texas.”  One individual Dye relies upon is his mentor, Jack Basler. Basler recognized Dye’s ability to serve and lead early in his tenure at Henry County Hospital.  Dye feels grateful for his influence and mentorship which prepared him to excel in his career. He encourages practitioners to recognize limitations and weaknesses in their skillset and surround themselves with individuals they can learn from, as well as individuals who complement their skill set.

    "body": "  ## Faculty Spotlight: Holly Vonderheit Brings 25 Years of Healthcare Marketing Experience to the Classroom    Whether offered through hands-on opportunities or lessons taught from those in the field, practical experience is a major component of any curriculum. The department of Health Policy and Management (HPM) at the IU Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health values practical experience, and seeks faculty with extensive experience to prepare students for successful careers of their own in health administration and public health.  Holly Vonderheit, executive director of strategic communications at Indiana University, has more than 25 years of experience leading communications and marketing for brands such as Riley Hospital for Children, Indiana University Health, and now Indiana University. When asked to share her expertise with students, Holly was thrilled to accept. She has been teaching for nearly 10 years and is currently an adjunct instructor at the Fairbanks School of Public Health.  “Given my various roles in healthcare marketing and communications over the years, I was often asked to speak to classes at IUPUI,” Holly said. “I thoroughly enjoyed preparing for the classes and connecting with students, so when I was asked to consider teaching, it wasn’t a hard sell.”  Holly teaches Health Care Marketing , an undergraduate course that offers a practical study of marketing in healthcare institutions, health service organizations, and health insurers. The course provides a basic foundation in marketing principles, new methods in marketing products and services, and inexpensive marketing techniques.  With healthcare practices evolving, the HPM department needs adjunct instructors who not only understand the structure and challenges of today’s healthcare system, but are also skilled in imparting that wisdom to aspiring healthcare leaders. Holly’s expertise navigating the changing landscape of healthcare marketing places her students at an advantage. Yet she believes her students are not the only ones benefiting from her coursework.  “Preparing for class keeps me fresh on industry trends,” she said. “I often find myself thinking about my students during my regular work day – how the projects I’m working on or individuals I’m meeting might support my students’ understanding of key concepts.”  Holly not only enjoys finding relevant ways to engage current students, but also loves connecting with students long after they complete her course.  “I love hearing from prior students and always smile when a student starts out a message with ‘…I don’t know if you remember me, but –.’ The type of student who reaches out is exactly the type of student an instructor remembers!”  In addition to coursework, all students in the BS program in Health Services Management, must also complete an internship before graduating. Internships and hands-on learning opportunities offer students a chance to demonstrate and enhance what they have learned from instructors like Holly. The HPM Department is seeking passionate adjunct instructors to help prepare the next generation of healthcare leaders. If you are interested in teaching an undergraduate course in the BS in Health Services Management program, please reach out to Sarah Johnson at shm@indiana.edu . "

By October 28, 2016, 210 people were diagnosed with HIV.   ### Community Outbreak of HIV Infection Linked to Injection Drug Use of Oxymorphone — Indiana, 2015  On January 23, 2015, the Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH) began an ongoing investigation of an outbreak of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, after Indiana disease intervention specialists reported 11 confirmed HIV cases traced to a rural county in southeastern Indiana. Historically, fewer than five cases of HIV infection have been reported annually in this county.  The majority of cases were in residents of the same community and were linked to syringe-sharing partners injecting the prescription opioid oxymorphone (a powerful oral semi-synthetic opioid analgesic). As of April 21, ISDH had diagnosed HIV infection in 135 persons (129 with confirmed HIV infection and six with preliminarily positive results from rapid HIV testing that were pending confirmatory testing) in a community of 4,200 persons (1).

The fact that the IU Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health was among the few that offered this innovative program and it was located in a dynamic metropolitan area solidified my desire to become a student.  \"Acquiring two professional degrees in four years was an amazing opportunity I would do again. This program offers a wide range of classes during the year and great options during the summer. The professors are knowledgeable on the subjects they teach and genuinely want to see you succeed. Through the courses I've taken, I know I'm meant to be a public health lawyer.  \"I want to analyze the way in which law is used as a tool to promote public health initiatives. The MPH-JD program supports the connection between these two disciplines and creates public health advocates prepared to improve quality of life. This past summer I worked for the CDC in their public health law program - they hire only interns currently in a duel degree MPH-JD program.\" "

    "body": "  ## FSPH COVID-19 Projects   ### Predictive Modeling  Using national and international data on the characteristics of COVID-19, Fairbanks School of Public Health researchers have adapted the existing CDC FluSurge forecasting model for use in Indiana. The researchers have combined Indiana population statistics, by age group, with Indiana hospital data measuring the number of beds, ICU beds, and ventilators that are available –– all to predict how demand for care among COVID-19 patients will impact hospital supply of beds and ventilators.  The researchers have prepared models at the state-level, facility-level, and each of the Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH) preparedness regions. At the state level, the researchers have worked with ISDH and the Family and Social Services Administration. In addition, they have presented to the Governor's Council at the Emergency Operations Center. At the facility level, they have worked with hospital leaders of major health systems and the Indiana Hospital Association to help them prepare for the influx of expected patients. The work they are doing is to inform health system leaders of the gaps in our public health infrastructure that require action to support the health of Hoosiers during this pandemic. The school wishes to see all of the health systems and public health agencies make decisions using the best available data on the evolving crisis to prepare and respond to COVID-19.   ### Hospital Surge Capacity  COVID-19 is projected to infect a substantial proportion of Hoosiers. Demand for hospital services, including the use of ventilators, is projected to outpace supply in Indiana and beyond. In preparation for this surge, the Fairbanks School of Public Health has developed a brief report that describes approaches that could facilitate the expansion of acute care and intensive care capacity within Indiana. Specifically, we delineate strategies to increase surge capacity at the facility level and at the community level. These strategies can be used by hospital and public health leaders to enhance the ability of providers to meet the need of COVID-19 patients. "

Point of Care Ultrasound (POCUS) utilizes portable, easy-to-use, and affordable ultrasound technology that allows for quicker discovery of medical issues right at the point of care. Images are available immediately and require no waiting to see if a patient must be transferred to a different healthcare facility or prepared for further imaging assessment. This has vastly improved the quality of care for patients than in the past. The addition of POCUS in clinical care settings improves provider accuracy and quality of care, and in turn, improves patient outcomes.  Identified benefits of task shifting in POCUS include improved diagnosis and support of clinical decision-making that leads to better bedside management, increased health services, and better health outcomes overall. Additional benefits include availability of imaging at primary care levels and empowerment of frontline healthcare workers.   ### POCUS ECHO mentorship program  Healthcare providers with an intermediate level knowledge of using point of care ultrasound are invited to apply for the inaugural cohort.  Candidates accepted into the competitive program will be eligible to receive a portable, handheld Butterfly ultrasound machine on loan from Indiana University and participate in bi-monthly rapid image reviews with seasoned POCUS experts.  Individuals selected will participate in 1:1 mentorship and rapid image review with a seasoned POCUS expert on the 1st and 3rd Mondays of each month from 12:30-1:00 pm ET, beginning Monday, October 16, 2023.

In addition to foundational public health knowledge based in the natural and social sciences, we also value contributions from the arts and humanities that serve to ensure the wholistic perspective necessary for achieving goals across cultures, whether at home or abroad.  The MS in Global Health and Sustainable Development program is delivered online with a mixture of 8-week and 16-week course formats. Most classes meet in real time via synchronous, Internet video and audio. You must have a reliable, high speed Internet connection to participate in the program.

    "body": "  ## HDS Student Internship Profile: Daniel Hauersperger  BS in Health Data Science Student Major(s): Health Data Science, Applied Math Minor: Computer Science  Daniel Hauersperger, a health data science student at the IU Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health, had the opportunity to complete an Xtern internship , the ultimate tech internship experience. Through Xtern , students work alongside industry leaders at Indianapolis’ fastest-growing tech companies, live and make friends with more than 100 other Xterns from around the country, and experience why the city is such an awesome place to live.  [Xtern internship](https://techpoint.org/Xtern)  Daniel was an analyst intern for OurHealth , an independent healthcare provider that offers the nation’s largest network of near-site clinics. His desire was to learn and apply his health data science knowledge and also gain experience.  [OurHealth](https://www.ourhealth.org/about-us/)  “As a member of the data team, I got to dive into the data and analytics at OurHealth ,” Daniel said. “The team leaders wanted to let me experience multiple areas of the business, so I spent time with several departments to identify and answer their data questions.”  Daniel was exposed to real analytics challenges with immediate applications, and believes his team did a great job of giving him the resources to answer them.  “The questions I sought to answer varied in difficulty and scope, with easy ones such as, \"What did the biometrics look like for a given subset of our population last year?,\" and harder questions such as, \"How many appointments do we predict to be missed?,\" he said.  What Daniel is learning in the health data science program helped him “countless times” in his internship and led to projects he believes he wouldn’t have otherwise tackled.  “Besides what I've learned about R [programming], which helped me standardize my answers to some of the data questions, my HDS education has given me knowledge of machine learning, which opened up a very interesting project,” Daniel said.  In addition to sharing what he knew, Daniel had a chance to learn from the team at OurHealth .  “My team committed to helping me learn,” he said. “A few specific things I learned about include PostgreSQL, Tableau, and how to make sure I'm answering the right business question.”  Daniel said this internship gave him a lot of insight into what he wants to do long-term, and strengthened his resolve to contribute to health and life sciences with data science and analytics.  “It was super fun to play a part in contributing to the analytics and data science capabilities of a fast-growing company.”  Learn about the BSHDS program   ## HDS student internship profiles "

    "body": "  ## MHA Program Rolls Out New Recruitment Process  Earlier this year, the Master of Health Administration program at the Indiana University Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health at IUPUI implemented a new recruitment process for prospective MHA students.  The process consists of an on-campus interview day with eligible applicants on an invite-only basis. Sessions begin each January and are held monthly until the class is filled.  “The goal is to first screen candidates, but it also serves as a marketing tool for the school,” said Ann Johnston, MHA program director at the Fairbanks School of Public Health.  The multifaceted process helps the school find more competitive students for its prestigious program, and allows applicants to meet and interview with faculty, MHA alumni, and student ambassadors. This year marks the highest percentage in decades of accepted offers, with 84 percent of enrollment offers being accepted.  “Our student ambassadors call applicants prior to interview day to give them details about the location and expectations of the interview,” Johnston said. “They build a rapport with the applicants before they step foot in our school.”  Advocates for the program, the student ambassadors are current MHA students who give applicants a first-hand look at life in the program.  “We help potential students learn about the program and the city of Indianapolis,” said Kelcie Meier, a student ambassador and current student of the MHA program. Originally from Iowa, Meier feels that her cohort bolsters her knowledge of Indianapolis when speaking to applicants, but says she “can speak to most aspects of the program.”  Upon arriving for the interview, student ambassadors greet the applicants and assist with grabbing coffee or water – small gestures that go far.  “I really love the new process,” Meier said. “I think it calms the nerves of the potential students because they are able to meet current classmates and see how we are normal students just like them.”  With the help of Nir Menachemi, professor and chair of the Health Policy and Management Department, Johnston begins the recruitment process with an introduction of the program.  “We explain why a student should choose the Fairbanks School of Public Health and why it’s a great time to pursue this degree,” Johnston said.  Following the introduction, applicants interview individually with one faculty member and one MHA program alum and have an opportunity to ask questions.  Juan Guzman, an MHA alumnus who helped interview applicants in the new process, said it was a great opportunity to interview students and truly take a deeper dive into explaining, ‘Why healthcare administration?’  “I had one candidate state that he was impressed by the faculty’s CVs and the experience as healthcare administrators they brought to the classroom,” Guzman said.  Once applicants have a chance to meet with the recruitment team, a thorough tour of the campus and lunch is provided. Following lunch, Johnston wraps up the day with a short exit interview.  After hearing about the program at a graduate fair, Michaela Davis applied, interviewed and accepted the offer to attend the MHA program at the Fairbanks School of Public Health. Though she admits being nervous, she said the recruitment process made a lasting impression.  \"I felt that they truly cared about what I had to say and were already genuinely interested in my success,\" Davis said. \"They made me feel like that was where I was supposed to be.\" "

    "body": "  ## Silvia M.  Bigatti, PhD  Professor  Resume/CV   ### Biography  Dr. Bigatti graduated from the Joint Program in Clinical Psychology between University of California San Diego and San Diego State University. Her degree is in Clinical Psychology with a Behavioral Medicine specialization. She completed her clinical internship at Yale University School of Medicine. Since obtaining her degree, Dr. Bigatti has been an academician and researcher, with over 60 publications and well over 150 research presentations at local, national, and international scientific conferences. She has received both internal and external funding for her research endeavors.   ### Research Interests  Dr. Bigatti is a psychological stress researcher. She examines the distinct psychological stress experienced by different populations and its negative physical and mental health outcomes. Over the years she's completed exploratory and experimental research examining a variety of stressors, including among college students, in chronically ill patients, and in work settings. In her current work she examines the stress of social determinants of health resulting in health disparities, and their effect on the health of patients. She uses a Community Based Participatory Research framework. To expand research to underserved populations, Dr. Bigatti co-founded the Latinx Community University Research Coalition of Indiana. The mission of the coalition is to connect university researchers with community organizations to address equity and well-being for Latinos across the state of Indiana, through community-engaged research efforts.   ### Courses Taught  PBHL-S 325: Public Mental Health PBHL-S 617: Health Promotion and Disease Prevention PBHL-S 619: Health Disparities Health Equity PBHL-S 640: Culture and Health PBHL-S 620: Stress and Population Health   ### Current Projects  Dr. Bigatti's ongoing projects focus on breast cancer in Black women, including exploring their experiences during treatment and developing interventions to improve these, especially with cancer care providers. This research follows a community-based participatory research framework, and addresses health disparities. Black women are more likely to die from breast cancer than all other groups, a disparity that in Indiana translates into a 42% higher likelihood of mortality. Dr. Bigatti partners with Pink-4-Ever Ending Disparities in research efforts to address this disparity. For the past 9 years, she has co-directed Your Life, Your Story.Latino Youth Summit, an arts-based, resilience-building, identity development summer program for Latino youth. In Indiana, Latino youth fare the worst in terms of depression and suicide. This work is in collaboration with the School of Education and the Latino Health Organization, a community serving non-profit and the Indiana Minority Health Coalition.   ### Selected Publications  [https://doi.org/10.1007/s40615-023-01537-1](https://doi.org/10.1007/s40615-023-01537-1)  [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnu.2019.08.007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnu.2019.08.007) "

She started studying nursing, but didn’t believe nursing was the best fit for her.  She began doing some research on different degrees and careers, and stumbled upon the Bachelor of Science in Health Services Management (BSHSM) program at Fairbanks School of Public Health.  “It was the perfect fit for me because it was the administrative side of healthcare, and really sparked my interest. It was a perfect fit!”  Once she started the program, Abby didn’t hesitate to get involved. She participated in the Fairbanks School of Public Health Student Association for two years.  “I was lucky enough to meet many of our professors and gain a better relationship with them. Our group was involved in different volunteer opportunities at IUPUI and in the community.”  Abby successfully completed the HSM program, and started working with Major Hospital/Major Health Partners (MHP) as a project coordinator after graduating. As the hospital Project Coordinator, Abby’s focus is on facilities. She works primarily on new construction and renovation projects throughout the organization, and assists Engineering in remaining compliant.  “My goal is to make sure our staff and contractors have what they need to produce the best outcome possible for our organization.”  Abby even assisted in the coordination, construction, relocation, and opening of their new hospital that opened in January 2017. “I was the point person between the hospital and relocation company that performed our move.”  Abby leans heavily on what she learned in the HSM program and says she uses her degree daily, especially when working on documents for the accreditation process.  The scenarios I worked on in my Capstone course really helped me be prepared for the different regulatory documents and surveys our facility is required to have to be an accredited hospital.  From the depreciation of medical equipment, to how to communicate to the public in case of an emergency, Abby enjoyed the program’s healthcare-based courses that touched on various real-life experiences every hospital deals with.  As for long-term goals, Abby desires to be a facility manger and to one day be responsible for all facility operations at a healthcare organization/hospital.  “Starting my career in this industry has opened up more doors than I could have imagined. I am looking forward to seeing where my career takes me!”  Learn About the BSHSM Program   ## Alumni Career Profiles "

    "body": "  ## Balance your career with a joint MPH-MD degree  Students admitted to the Indiana University School of Medicine, at any of the nine IUSM campuses, are eligible to apply to the joint MPH-MD program at the IU Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health at IUPUI.  This degree will prepare you to balance your career between direct medical care of individuals and public health practice within communities. It will also expand your career options by making you more marketable for a wide variety of careers (i.e. global health, hospital leadership, health policy, health research, nonprofit management, environmental health, and refugee and immigrant health). The MPH-MD program is designed for completion in five years.  I was armed at graduation to begin service as a public health practitioner for individual patients, scholarship development and program building.   ### Admissions  Medical students who are interested in pursuing the joint MPH-MD degree must apply and be admitted to the Fairbanks School of Public Health through the dual degree application supplement . Once accepted you will be asked to complete an IU application through the Online Graduate and Professional Admissions Application.  [dual degree application supplement](https://iu.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8jqrfDUK6bnMSWi)  Students in the MPH-MD program may be considered for limited stipends to offset some of the tuition expenses of the public health coursework. You are encouraged to apply to the MPH program the spring semester before you wish to begin your public health course work; however, arrangements will be made to facilitate completion of the joint degree program at any point during your medical education.   #### Alumni Career Profiles  To help our prospective students understand the possibilities a degree in Public Health offers, we've asked several alumni to share the career opportunities they have had since graduating. Browse the alumni career profiles to see what our graduates are up to.   ### Curriculum  Fairbanks School of Public Health at IUPUI and the Indiana University School of Medicine have developed an innovative coordinated MPH-MD curriculum that integrates medicine and public health training. Students learn key public health topics, including issues related to environmental health, infectious disease control, biostatistics, disease prevention and health promotion, injury control, epidemiological studies, and health policy.  To make it easy to complete two degrees in such a short time, up to 12 credits of the total 45 MPH credits are shared from a list of pre-approved MD 4th-year elective credits. The MPH-MD begins with core public health courses that are taken online during their first summer term. The remaining classes are completed during the fall and spring semesters, typically between the third and fourth years of medical school; however, other arrangements can be made. To incorporate experiential learning, a final public health internship and project are required.  Students in the MPH-MD dual degree program will have the option of having a global health focus where they spend a year in IUSM’s program in Kenya participating in an ongoing research project while also getting exposure to clinical care in Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital and its clinics. During that year, they will complete their required MPH coursework online.  MPH-MD students who began the program summer 2022 and beyond will be required to pass the Certified Public Health exam to meet graduation requirements.   ### Example plans of study   ## Interdisciplinary Public Health Studies  This concentration provides you with a broad foundation to tackle the complex problems facing us today.

    "body": "  ## MHA Student Says Stella Scholarship Makes Health Administration Opportunities Possible  Abigail Corbett, a Master of Health Administration student at the IU Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health says receiving the Ken and Cindy Stella Scholarship will allow her to say ‘yes’ to exciting opportunities as an MHA student. Abigail has a love for healthcare that was instilled by her parents, Deb and Larry Corbett, who both have health careers. Deb is a nurse in interventional radiology with IU Health, and Larry is a recently-retired physician of 40 years.  [Ken and Cindy Stella Scholarship](https://www.ihaconnect.org/about/awards/Pages/Stella-Scholarship-Award.aspx)  Abigail’s parents played a huge role in her life, always encouraging her to pursue higher education and teaching her what it means to care for others and for patients. Having an appreciation for clinical careers, Abigail completed a Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology and served as a medical scribe in the Emergency Department at Community Hospital South for two years.  “Originally, I thought I wanted to pursue a Master’s Degree in Physician Assistant Studies,” she said. “However, working in the emergency department caused my outlook on healthcare to dramatically change, and I became interested in the operation of hospitals and how departments and employees are affected by those operations.”  Abigail decided to pursue an MHA degree at the Fairbanks School of Public Health with a desire to learn the processes behind preventative healthcare, employee relations, strategic planning, and budgeting practices. The summer prior to starting her courses, Abigail was notified by MHA program director, Dr. Ann Johnston, that she had been nominated as a candidate for the Ken and Cindy Stella Scholarship based on her GPA and review of her MHA application.  [Ken and Cindy Stella Scholarship](https://www.ihaconnect.org/about/awards/Pages/Stella-Scholarship-Award.aspx)  “I was incredibly grateful and excited for the chance to apply,” she said. “Currently, I am working, going to school, and planning a wedding. This scholarship would allow me to take full advantage of my education and provide me with significant financial flexibility to attend national conferences and become an active member of healthcare administration associations.”  The Stella Scholarship is awarded to full-time MHA students with a GPA of 3.0 or better, and provides $10,000 per year for two years. Earlier this fall, Abigail received the Stella Scholarship and has big plans for her tenure as a graduate student.  “With this scholarship, I will have the ability to devote more time to my studies, pursue opportunities for growth, and spend my full energy on personal leadership development,” she said. “I wanted to have the ability to give my all to the MHA program and receive all that it is able to offer. The Stella Scholarship has given me the ability to do that, and so much more.”  Pursuing this degree has not been without its struggles for Abigail. In fact, she admits that there were many obstacles for her to overcome before reaching this moment. Persistence, however, has been the key to her success.  “I had to take two additional classes as prerequisites before I could start the program, not to mention the financial and time commitment of the program itself,” said Abigail, whose long-term goal is to earn a graduate degree and work toward a leadership position in human resources at a healthcare institution.  “The thing that has helped me the most is to picture my future, write out my goals, and continually remind myself what a blessing it is that I get to do this. As cliché as it sounds, I know it will be worth it.”  Abigail is also thankful for her fiancé, Kilian Sweet, who encouraged her to return to school for a master’s degree. She believes she may not have pursued the MHA program had he not been “so on board and reassuring.” To celebrate Abigail receiving the scholarship, the couple enjoyed dinner at BoomBozz pizza.  “It was really fun to celebrate with him. We aren’t a super wild pair, but we were both really excited and it felt good to celebrate, even if it was in a small way.” "

    "body": "  ## Freshman’s Love for Debate Leads Her to Health Services Management Major  Faiza Qureshi, a freshman in the Health Services Management program at the IU Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health, attributes her passion for policy and healthcare reform to her early debate days at Ben Davis High School. While on the team, she went to nationals twice for speech and debate, and has long wanted a health career.  “I grew up wanting to work in healthcare,” Faiza said. “Initially, I wanted to be a doctor, but as I explored that path more I realized that I didn't always want to be the one directly providing care.”  Faiza connected with an academic advisor at the Fairbanks School of Public Health and explained her goals of using her leadership and problem-solving skills to make an impact, but on the big picture of healthcare. She learned about the health services management (HSM) major and according to her, “the rest is history.”  Now a freshman in the HSM program, Faiza is looking forward to “adulting” and the chance to finally take classes that really interest her.  “I really love the class ‘Health Care Delivery in the U.S.,’” she said. “I am learning about the healthcare system and enjoy explaining to others how things like insurance work.”  Faiza’s long-term goal is to work her way into the C-suite of a hospital, a popular term for the suite for chief officers (i.e. chief executive officer, chief financial officer, etc.). For now, however, she is excited about beginning the journey.  “I'm just in my first semester and learning so much,” she said. “Most people don't understand how the healthcare system works. This major will open my eyes and broaden my perspective.”  In her free time, Faiza continues to coach current students on the debate team at Ben Davis High School, and says her most memorable debate topic was defending the idea that Twilight made vampires look weak.

    "body": "  ## Dual Degree Alumna Takes Alternate Route into Health Administration  Bree Tonte, alumna of the MPH/MHA dual degree program at the IU Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health, has long wanted a career in health. While today she is the network operations fellow at Community Health Network, she started with a position delivering trays to patients at Riley Children’s Hospital. Bree saw this role in the kitchen as an opportunity to break into the health field.  “I started as a nutrition services representative, delivering the trays to the patients,” she said. “I knew I was interested in healthcare and I loved pediatrics, so I looked for an entry level position at Riley Children’s Hospital just to get my foot in the door.”  Bree had decided to take one year off in between undergraduate and graduate school to make sure she was choosing a career path she could see herself in long-term. During her break, she struggled to find a position that would allow her to put her undergraduate degree in exercise science to use.  “Most positions I found interesting during my year off, required five or more years of experience,” Bree said. “With that in mind, I decided to take an alternate route!”  In her position as nutrition services representative, Bree became a team lead early on and started to get a feel for management. As opportunities for process improvements arose, she took the initiative to make changes. Likewise, when she was offered the opportunity to attend meetings with her manager, she accepted.  “I was fortunate to have a boss that allowed me to grow and attend a lot of his meetings,” Bree said. “That allowed me to see how all of the varying roles in a hospital come together to serve the patients.”  She started to realize how much she appreciated attending those meetings, managing the staff, and making process improvements in the department, and her career interests shifted.  “I loved making a positive impact in my department while also improving the quality of care for the patients. That is when I started to do some research and found the MHA program at IUPUI. I have always been drawn to healthcare and management, but I knew I would need more to fill my cup.”  Bree dived right in, enrolling in the MPH/MHA dual degree program at the Fairbanks School of Public Health. While enrolled, she worked as a market analyst at IU Health, a position that started as an internship. In this role, Bree provided data on market share and population demographics to their business development, strategy, and marketing teams.  Additionally, Bree was accepted into the Eskenazi Health Scholar Program which offers dual degree MHA/MPH students a generous scholarship and the unique opportunity for hands-on training in the health system.  As an Eskenazi Health Scholar, she was exposed to the Primary Care Quality Department, Service Excellence, and the Healthy Families program at Eskenazi. She also had the opportunity to work as the project manager for their hypertension grant.  Bree’s drive is energized by the constant reminder that she is helping others, coupled with her desire to make her parents and fiancé proud. “Their endless belief in me has pushed me to continue to give my best effort and make them proud of everything I do,” she said.  As the Community Health Network Fellow, Bree’s main goal is to learn as much as she can. She recently finished her first rotation with senior leadership at Community Hospital South and is now working with the SVP of Ambulatory Services. Bree knows she is drawn to a patient- or community-focused position, but plans to keep her options open.  “This year I am focusing on trying to not focus on one specific career or role,” Bree said. “To make sure I get the most out of this fellowship, I am trying to see every aspect of the network and how it all works together. There is no better way to learn and grow than to be in this type of setting and I can see it playing a large role in wherever I end up in the future!” "

    "body": "  ## Earn your Graduate Certificate in Public Health and MS in Kinesiology  Preventive practices are gaining favor over the traditional treatment approach to health care in the United States. Preventive practices not only improve overall health and quality of life but are much more cost effective than the treatment required for diseases associated with a sedentary lifestyle.  Public health is the science of protecting and improving the health of communities through education, promotion of healthy lifestyles, and research for disease and injury prevention. With the growing awareness of the role that exercise plays in promoting wellness and preventing disease, the role of the exercise specialist with knowledge of public health will rise in prominence as a career of choice.  The master’s degree in kinesiology combined with a graduate certificate in public health is designed to provide students with an in-depth science-based understanding of how exercise/physical activity interventions can decrease risk of diseases related to sedentary living and prevent health problems from happening or recurring through surveillance, educational programs, sound public health policies, and research.   ### Master of Kinesiology curriculum   ## MS in Kinesiology Required Courses  Take all six courses for 18 credits   ## Directed Kinesiology Electives  Take three credits of electives   ### Graduate Certificate in Public Health  The Graduate Certificate in Public Health is a 15-credit-hour program of study. Courses for the certificate program are offered in the fall, spring, and summer. Courses are available in person or online.  In order to receive the Graduate Certificate in Public Health, students must complete 15 credit hours of approved public health coursework with a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0. Transfer credit or course waivers are not allowed as substitution for any courses in the certificate program.  NOTE: Students who have been awarded a Graduate Certificate in Public Health have two years to apply their credits toward the MPH or MS in Kinesiology degree. Graduates of the certificate program who do not apply to the MPH or MS in Kinesiology program within two years after completion of the certificate will not be allowed to apply the 15 credits from the certificate program toward the MPH or MS in Kinesiology programs on the IUPUI campus.  For example, a student who uses some or all of the certificate credits toward the Master’s in Public Health (MPH) cannot use the same credits toward the MS in Kinesiology degree. Admission to or successful completion of the Certificate in Public Health does not guarantee subsequent admission into the MPH program or MS in Kinesiology graduate programs.   ## Curriculum  Take any five of the course selections below for 15 hours   ## Curriculum - prior to fall 2023  Take all five course for 15 hours "

Fairbanks School of Public Health’s Center for Health Policy held a Population Health Summit in late May. With the goal of improving health information sharing and identifying shared population health priorities, the summit focused primarily on the technology and exchange of health information. Committed to improving population health and transforming how care services are delivered, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s State Health Value and Strategies Program supported the event.  The summit began with a welcome from Indiana State Health Commissioner Jerome Adams, MD, MPH, followed by a series of panel discussions led by Health Policy & Management faculty Nir Menachemi, PhD, MPH, Joshua Vest, PhD, MPH, and Joan Duwve, MD, MPH. The panelists also included Paul MacLellan, CEO of Medical Advantage Group; Emily Webber, MD of the Indiana University School of Medicine; Waldo A. Mikels-Carrasco, Director of Population Health Research and Development at MHIN; and Drew Richardson, Director of Population Health at the Indiana Health Information Exchange.  Not only did the summit provide an in-depth look at the growing importance and benefits of a population health perspective, but it also allowed attendees to identify, refine, and select a course for actionable solutions. Small and large groups convened to discuss the priority areas in which to work collaboratively for improved population health and to identify methods for better leveraging the state’s health information technology resources. The health summit proved to be a successful event for fostering common understanding and developing a consensus around population health. Dr. Vest said the summit “served to point a diverse group of stakeholders and organizations in a common direction for better population health.”  The work of the summit will be continued by a steering committee with representation from the Indiana State Department of Health, the Indiana Hospital Association, and the IU Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health’s Center for Health Policy. "

    "body": "  ## Alumni career profile: Mark Daiuto  BSPH in Community Health, 2017  I chose the Bachelor of Science in Public Health—Community Health program because I wanted to understand health from a world-wide perspective. Community health focuses on our own communities’ health, as well as distant communities, and it allows us to better understand how other cultures address the problems we also face.  I also had an interest in actively improving the health of others. While following a pre-med curriculum can help accomplish this in the long-run, the BSPH-CH program allowed me to gain first-hand experience with helping others from day one.  I first learned about the community health degree at the IU Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health by looking for elective classes on the IUPUI registrar. Once I contacted someone within the school, I quickly learned a lot more about the degree program and the vision the school has for its students.  One thing I really love about the field of community health is that it requires a broad understanding of different subjects to achieve a very specific objective. For example, if you want to focus on reducing the incidence of HIV spread in rural Indiana, you must understand the history of the area, the demographic of the citizens, and the social/political institutions at the state and local level. This thought process can be applied to almost all problems even when they seem unrelated to public health.  The BSPH-CH program has instilled in me the desire to be inquisitive in looking at real-world problems. This makes it much easier to network with professionals because I can ask in-depth questions and show a genuine interest in the work they do.  Through the research experiences I had, I acquired highly marketable skills such as grant writing, graphic design, and program planning. This not only made me a more competitive applicant for medical school, but also allowed me to join a few quality-improvement programs at Riley Children’s Hospital.  A community health degree can allow you to become a health educator, a program planner, a policy influencer, researcher, and marketable in almost any career field.  Plus, whether it’s business, law, or medicine, this is a wonderful base for any graduate degree program as I have used this degree as a platform to pursue an MD-MPH.  The BSPH—Community Health program at the Fairbanks School of Public Health has set me up for success in many ways. I have the knowledge, research skills and hands-on domestic and international experience that has prepared me to tackle real-world problems.  Wondering what you can do with a public health degree? Through the BSPH in Community Health, students gain knowledge, research skills and hands-on domestic and international experience that prepares them to tackle real-world problems. With such high demand and potential job growth for professionals with health-related degrees, it is an exciting time to be in the public health sector. We’re currently facing extraordinary challenges, but we have the unique opportunity to transform the health of people in Indiana and beyond. Whether you’re interested in pre-medicine, pre-dentistry, or pre-nursing programs, or a health career not bound to just hospitals, our BSPH—Community Health program can help you get there.

IUPUI is my school. Coming from Niger, a third-world country, taught me so much of what it means to be a minority. I have moved from state to state, but being here at this school has never made me feel like I don’t belong here. Not only are my professors and advisors very helpful and respectful, but so are my classmates.  My first semester I did not make friends, but my second semester I got to know more people than I could ever have. I did not let my background stop me from talking to people of different cultures.  Through my major, Global International Studies, I have made lifetime friends. We share a common background and put our differences on the side to support one another. This shows how lucky I am for being an IUPUI student. We may come from different countries but our major united us all.  IUPUI is one of the most diverse places I have ever been. It’s a place where you meet people that you never thought you would meet in your life time. The best place on campus that I found interesting is the library. It has become a place of social interaction for me.  Adjusting to American Culture  I was an English as s Second Language student once, and now I am assisting with teaching an ESL class to other students like me. This is a sign of hope that no matter what your background is, there is a place for you in this nation called America – where you never know which opportunities will come to you.  I remember how hard it was for me to adjust into the American culture when I first arrived in the United States. I did not speak English and was a teenager thrown into the American teenager life. Something that was hard to understand was the opportunities many teens have. Back home, we did not have the luxuries they have, but we still used what was available for us to pursue an education.  We may not have had all the technical resources, but we survived on what was available to us to make sure we got educated.  Coming from a majority Black country and now being in a minority Black country was hard to adjust to, but being a minority does not mean being alone. Its means that you are different and unique in your own way, and that should not stop you from becoming who you want to be.  Fatima interned with the Fairbanks School of Public Health to learn more about global health and communication. After completing her undergraduate degree, she plans to pursue a career in global health, working within a healthcare organization. "

    "body": "  ## PhD in Epidemiology curriculum  To complete this degree, you will take a combination of required epidemiology core courses, methods courses, elective courses, a doctoral minor, doctoral research seminars, and guided dissertation research that together total 90 credits.  If applicants to the epidemiology PhD program have recently completed an MPH program in epidemiology or a related area and therefore already have solid academic preparation in epidemiology and biostatistics, they may not need to take select foundation courses, which would reduce their required curriculum credits.  Individuals accepted into the program who do not have the foundation courses in epidemiology and biostatistics will be required to take the full 90-credit curriculum.   ## Required Core Courses (27 credits)  Take all nine courses for a total of 27 credits.   ## Methods Courses* (15 credits)  Choose five courses for a total of 15 credits.  *Students may take methods and substantive electives offered by other IUPUI departments with advisor approval.   ## Elective Courses* (12 credits)  Choose four courses for a total of 12 credits.  *Students may take methods and substantive electives offered by other IUPUI departments with advisor approval.   ## Minor Area (12 credits)  Students must complete a PhD minor in an area related to a health and life science. The minor in most cases is comprised of four graduate-level courses (12 credit hours) in the chosen area and must comply with the minor requirements of the respective department/unit.   ## Doctoral Research Seminars (3 credits)  Students will enroll in three doctoral research seminars. Each seminar is one credit, for a total of three credits. (PBHL E775)   ## Dissertation (21 credits)   ## For students who started the PhD in Epidemiology prior to fall 2023  Core courses  Take all 10 courses for a total of 30 credits.  Methods  Choose three courses for a total of 9 credits.  *Students may take methods and substantive electives offered by other IUPUI departments with advisor approval.  Electives  Choose five courses for a total of 15 credits.  Seminar  Complete 3 credits.  Minor  Complete 12 credits.  Dissertation  Complete 21 credits.   ### Other degree requirements for the PhD in Epidemiology  Public health coursework Epidemiology students without a graduate degree, certificate or coursework in public health will be required to complete online introductory modules on Environmental Health, Health Policy and Management, and Social and Behavioral Science to ensure that they have basic competencies in all five core public health areas. This is a requirement of the Council on Education in Public Health (CEPH), the school’s accrediting body.  PhD advisory committee The department of epidemiology will set up an advisory committee for the student, typically in the first year after admission to the PhD program. The advisory committee usually includes at least two epidemiologists and one or two faculty members from another discipline. The advisory committee will approve the student’s program of study and counsel the student until he or she passes the qualifying examination. Each PhD student will also be assigned to an academic advisor from one of the full-time faculty members in the department of epidemiology.  Minor area The student will select a minor from an academic unit other than the department of epidemiology. The PhD minor must be approved by the student’s advisory committee, and comply with requirements of the respective minor department or program. Examples of minors include: biostatistics, genetics, pharmacology, toxicology, health economics, environmental health, and health informatics.  Qualifying examinations The qualifying examination will be based upon the student’s PhD coursework and will be taken after all courses have been completed. Students who fail the qualifying examination are normally allowed to retake it only once. The qualifying exam will be a written exam.  Students who have passed the qualifying examination must enroll each semester (excluding summer sessions) for dissertation credits. Once such students have accumulated 90 credit hours in completed course work and dissertation credits, they must enroll for six hours of graduate credit (GRAD-G901) each semester until the degree is completed. The fee for this course is $150. Students are permitted to enroll in G901 for a maximum of six semesters.  The department of epidemiology will monitor the student’s progress toward the PhD degree and will make recommendations to the University Graduate School regarding the nomination to candidacy, the appointment of a research committee, the defense of the dissertation, and the conferring of the PhD degree.  Dissertation The dissertation will be written on an original topic of research and presented as one of the final requirements for the PhD degree. The student’s dissertation research committee will be comprised of members of the graduate faculty. The chair of the dissertation research committee must be a regular faculty member in the department of epidemiology and a full member of the graduate faculty.  The student will submit to the IUPUI Graduate Office, acting for the University Graduate School, a two-page prospectus of the dissertation research and the membership of the research committee at least six months before the defense of the dissertation for their approval.  After the committee has reviewed the dissertation, the decision to schedule the defense will be made. The student will then present and defend the dissertation orally in a public forum before the committee. Following the dissertation defense, all deficiencies must be adequately addressed to obtain approval by the dissertation research committee. "

As a government appointed, central employer, it is our responsibility to continue producing projects for our customers that make life safer and even save lives. On top of the impact we are making by producing life-saving medical devices, we are donating boxed lunches and N95 masks to local health care facilities here in Indianapolis.   ### Joshua Burger, MHA – BSHSM 2010  I work on the health insurance side as IU Health offers our own Commercial and Medicare Advantage health plan options for our own employees and other businesses around the state. Our main focus since the COVID-19 pandemic has been focusing on our members first. We have built and communicated a benefit structure to ensure that should any of our members need tested or contract the virus, they will not have out of pocket expenses. We have also enhanced our telemedicine benefits to allow our members to utilize virtual health care instead of physically going to a provider office so they can continue to receive needed services but do not put themselves or others at risk. Our second focus, from my team's perspective, has been working with our contracted provider network. Our network includes much more than just the IU Health affiliated providers. As we make changes and updates to our member's benefits, we also need to communicate these to our providers as it impacts them as well, specifically helping them navigate and understand the world of telemedicine since many of them did not do it prior or did it at a very limited capacity.   ### Elena Smith, BSHSM 2017  Description of the video:  Hi, my name is Elena Smith and I graduate with my HSM degree in May of 17. I currently work at Mount Carmel Health System in the clinical quality management department. I am going to share with you two coronavirus-related tasks that I have been charged with. First, from a health systems level, this includes four hospitals and two joint ventures. I was the person who managed all of the poster signs. These were placed at the front entrances of all of our sites letting patients and family members know that if they were having the cough or the fever symptoms, they needed a mask. As the coronavirus changed very rapidly, more and more patients began having these symptoms, we had to then place the masks behind the front desks, therefore needing to change the directions of that sign. I have been working with communications on trying to do that and get them delivered to our sites as fast as possible. From a department level, I worked with my VP on the work-from-home guidelines for our data team, regulatory nurses and quality nurses who were able to transition into that work-from-home lifestyle. In specifics, I worked with making job aids, and how to make it more efficient for those nurses who are working from home. This has been a major change as we do all work at the corporate office and run to our hospitals to work on a daily basis. As nonclinical colleagues, a lot of our work is behind the scenes, however it makes the operations of those at the frontline run more smoothly and more efficient.   ### Viola Long, BSHSM 2016  I am thankful that my organization has provided us the opportunity to work from home as we continue to serve our patients during this time. As healthcare gravitates towards more technology-based platforms, this has been a rewarding experience for my department. In addition, being able to provide virtual care, something we have not done before, has allowed us to keep ourselves, our families, patients, and communities safer. With things changing rapidly, my resilience is at an all time high and these trials have only made us stronger. Together, we can fight this!   ### Kathleen Hacker, BSHSM 2018  Description of the video:  Hi, everyone. I am Katy Hacker, I graduated from IUPUI in May of 2018 with my Bachelor’s in Health Services Management. I now work in long-term care at Hamilton Trace in Fischer’s Indiana. I am an admissions coordinator here. I normally bring new admissions for our short-term rehab or even our long-term care memory unit. With the pandemic that is going on, I am now doing things a little bit differently in my day to day tasks, so I am now the main communication pieces for all of our residents and their family members. I set up Facetimes with families, I help our residents write messages and take pictures and send videos so they can still feel as connected as possible with their loved ones during this difficult time. On top of that, I am helping to build up the staff morale by keeping the building as positive as possible. By doing that, I am showing our clinical staff how appreciated they are with all the hard work they are doing. I am buying lunches; I am passing around snacks and some gifts that our corporate office is giving to us. A little bit different than what I am used to, but I still feel like I am making an impact just by showing our clinical staff just how appreciated they are and letting the family members stay connected with our residents.   ### Kristian Scolnik, BSHSM 2018  My name is Kristian and I am a 2018 BSHSM graduate. I am currently working as the Talent & Culture Manager for a diagnostic lab who launched drive-thru testing for Covid-19 a little over a week ago. I am on my third week of working from home, so I have been helping coordinate the new testing away from the office, which has been challenging. I have been fielding a lot of calls and making sure people at risk are taken care of accordingly. This is not something I ever expected to deal with in my career in health services management, but am so grateful for my education that has helped guide me through this!   ### Jessica Sparks, BSHSM 2016  I work for Adaptive Nursing, which is a home health care company. We work with the elderly and disabled and are currently doing everything we can to ensure that our clients are getting all the assistance they need to in order to stay in their homes and in a safe environment. We are currently providing caregivers with masks, gloves, hand sanitizer and are asking caregivers to take temperatures before going to work and relaying if they are experiencing any symptoms in order to ensure we are taking safe precautions while they are in the home. We also had a hand washing training and are asking caregivers to go to the grocery store for their clients to ensure that clients are not putting themselves at risk and staying home as much as possible. Our clients are the most susceptible during this pandemic and are relying on our care and precautions to stay healthy and at home during this time.   ### Mackenzie Davidson, MHA – BSHSM 2018  During the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, patient experience has never been more important. I am playing an important role by analyzing, summarizing and sharing with system leaders what our patients are telling us through their post discharge surveys. By monitoring and identifying common themes, whether good or bad, our system can continue to provide the best patient-centered care while fighting COVID-19.   ### Madeline Helpling, BSHSM 2018  During the scary and unsettling times brought on by Covid-19, teamwork and communication are a requirement. I am proud to be part of an amazing group of physicians and clinical staff who are so dedicated to this team and its patients. My name is Madeline Helpling and I am the practice administrator for Riverview Health’s freestanding emergency room in Fishers, Indiana. Supporting a team of emergency room physicians and my medical director during a global pandemic can be difficult when working remotely from home! The main things that I have been doing are implementing disaster plan privilege guidelines for our physicians who will come from other areas of the US, staying in communication with our clinical nursing director to ensure supplies aren’t needed, ensuring that my providers are explained of COVID-19 updates and changes, and making phone calls out into the community to look for additional PPE supplies. We have also began to implement a telemedicine program with our ER, which is very exciting. The only way we are going to get through this is together! "

The program provides a great blend of both administrative and legal thinking. The professors are knowledgeable and willing to help, and the schedule is doable, with law classes during the day and MHA classes in the evening.  \"The MHA provides me with another way of thinking that will complement my JD, whether in a law firm, hospital, or other setting. If you have an interest in healthcare and know that healthcare is where you want to take your career, I would suggest seriously considering the JD-MHA.\"   ### Kreigh Cook  JD-MHA student \"Combining the law and MHA curricula offered me the opportunity to have a very unique and valuable skill-set that appeals to both law firms and healthcare networks. The JD-MHA program has allowed me to pursue internships in law, as well as healthcare administration, while maintaining a full-time class schedule.  \"The MHA offers me a better understanding of healthcare administration, which facilitates better legal counsel. If you have an interest in health law and policy, as well as administration, don't miss out on the opportunity to gain a competitive edge in the job market.\"   ### Allison Potenza  JD-MHA student \"After college, I knew I wanted to be involved in healthcare policy, but I didn't know what career opportunities were available. When I learned about the JD-MHA joint degree, I knew it was perfect because it would give me an opportunity to focus my passion in a highly marketable way.  \"The JD-MHA program gives students great real-world experience that is so essential to career development. In my three years in the program, I have completed an externship at a hospital, been a research assistant for a renowned health law professor, worked in a health law firm, and will soon have the opportunity to go to Washington D.C. for an internship at the Department of Health and Human Services.  \"I have made invaluable connections with friends, professors, and practitioners in the field. I believe these opportunities are putting me on a path toward a successful and fulfilling career. I would encourage anyone who is serious about a career in healthcare law and management to consider the JD-MHA program. Although it is a challenging experience, it has definitely been worthwhile.\" "

Peer educators:  To date, the INPEP ECHO has trained over 200 peer educators at multiple Indiana Department of Correction locations. Peer educators have reached thousands of people incarcerated through their 10-hour health education workshops.  The Indiana Peer Education Program is a collaboration between the IUI ECHO Center, Step-Up, Inc., the Viral Hepatitis Program at the Indiana Department of Health, and the Indiana Department of Correction.   ### Three main goals   ### Facilities participating   ### 10-Hour Workshop Training Topics   ### Hub Team   #### Lorenzo Bell    PEP Program Specialist | Step-Up, Inc.

Carson is a junior in the Accelerated BS in HSM – MHA program and maintains an impressive GPA. Originally from Frankfort, Indiana, he thinks Indianapolis offers a unique opportunity for studying public health. “In Indianapolis, there are five major hospital systems. Here in our city, there are plenty of chances to get internships, job shadowing, informative interviews and volunteering opportunities. I currently have an internship at IU Health; this is something that could not have happened without being here in Indianapolis.”  Carson is the President of the Undergraduate Association at the Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health and is involved in Circle K International. If you ask him about his favorite courses, he quickly responds that he “loves all of his classes,” but he has found particular enjoyment from Healthcare Marketing, Health Information Technology, and Operations Management.  Carson wishes people knew how many career opportunities there are in health administration. “From working in a hospital, to being in the field or even conducting research, health administration is such a broad umbrella that has so much opportunity. Healthcare has something to offer for everyone.” "

Seminar Series   ### Addressing factors that affect health care costs: Recommendations for Indiana stakeholders  Rising health care costs are of concern to Indiana consumers, employers, policymakers, health care providers, and other health care stakeholders, especially because of poor health outcomes in the state. Several recent analyses have elevated the discussion about the prices of hospital care in our state. However, many factors contribute to overall health care costs beyond price.  Any policy interventions, based upon a limited understanding of the larger context, unnecessarily risks positioning stakeholders against each other without addressing the overall problem. This report is motivated by the need to move Indiana towards lower overall health care costs especially through concerted efforts that will improve the health of Hoosiers.   ### Cost of Care Study  Addressing Factors that Affect Health Care Costs: Recommendations for Indiana Stakeholders  State Epidemiological Reports  Issue Briefs  Data Portal   ### Technical Reports   ## Technical Reports  Partnerships for Success (PFS): Young Adult Interview Results (Phase 2). Between January and March of 2019, the second phase of the Indiana Young Adults Survey was administered to a sample of 18- to 25-year-olds in each of the 10 PFS-funded communities, including Cass, Clark, Floyd, Knox, Lake, Madison, Marion, Porter, Scott, and Vanderburgh counties. Survey respondents were asked if they would like to be contacted for a follow-up interview. A total of 32 interviews were completed; each participant received a $25 Amazon gift card for their time. The goal of the interviews was to gain a deeper understanding of substance use behaviors, perceptions, and attitudes among young adults in these communities.  Laporte Report The opioid epidemic continues to affect the lives of many Americans. Paralleling the rise in prescription opioid (pain reliever) sales over the past two decades, the country also experienced an increase in opioid-related morbidity and mortality. In Indiana alone, 270,000 residents ages 12 and older reported misusing prescription opioids, and 24,000 reported heroin use in the past year. The percentage of substance use treatment admissions related to opioid misuse, prescription or illicit, has increased steadily. In more than half (57%) of all treatment admissions in LaPorte County in 2017, the misuse of an opioid was reported. Furthermore, nearly 100 LaPorte County residents died of a fatal drug overdose between 2012 and 2016. Based on findings from the LaPorte County survey and key informant interviews that were conducted in the community, respondents cited lack of or limited access to treatment services, especially detoxification, inpatient services, and medication-assisted treatment, as a major challenge in dealing with the epidemic. Furthermore, socio-economic factors, such as poverty and unemployment, and limited awareness or acceptance of the problem within the larger community, together with insufficient funding to address the problem, were described as contributing factors.  Key Findings and Recommendations from the 2013 IPLA INSPECT Knowledge and Use Survey (published 2014) The Center for Health Policy in collaboration with the Indiana Professional Licensing Agency and the State Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention Task Force Education Committee developed a web-based survey to gather information on prescribers and dispensers knowledge, use, and opinions of INSPECT as well as to assess prescribers and dispensers attitudes and beliefs about prescribing and dispensing opioids. Key findings suggest that both providers and dispensers are strongly supportive and frequent users of the INSPECT program; the majority of users believe INSPECT is generally effective and a valuable tool in state-wide efforts to reduce the misuse, abuse, and diversion of prescription drugs.  The Indiana INSPECT Evaluation: Key Findings and Recommendations from a Descriptive Analysis of INSPECT Data (published 2014) The purpose of this report is to provide a descriptive analysis of 2011-2013 INSPECT data. Most of the controlled substances dispensed in the observed time period were opioids, especially hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen combinations (e.g., Vicodin). Benzodiazepines also contributed to a large portion of dispensations. Potential doctor-shoppers were more likely to be younger and had filled a higher number of opioid prescriptions than individuals characterized as non-shoppers. More dispensations of opioid analgesics were attributable to MDs than any other profession with prescription privileges.  Mental Health and Substance Abuse Needs Assessment for Marion County (published 2010) This needs assessment was conducted for Mental Health America of Greater Indianapolis (MHAGI). The purpose was to examine prevalence, consequences, and correlates of mental illness and substance abuse in Marion County.   ### Community Needs Assessment  In a community needs assessment (CNA), we collect data to identify major health and social service needs, and determine the gaps between a community’s needs and their available resources. These data may be obtained through administrative records, surveys, focus groups and interviews, public meetings, or direct observations. CNAs provide community leaders with a snapshot of the local landscape, and help prioritize central health issues and areas for improvement.   ### Community Needs Assessment   "

The purpose of this minor is to provide PhD students with a new minor option that helps them develop conceptual and methodological depth in social science or related reference disciplines that are frequently drawn on by researchers who study health systems or health services, including Economics, Psychology, Sociology, Biostatistics, and Communication Studies.  Because these areas of study often employ related concepts and methods, this minor will allow students to take minor courses that cut across departments and programs while still provide depth in a non-major area of study.   ### Curriculum   ## Health Systems and Services Research Minor Curriculum  Students will complete 12 credits by choosing from the list of substantive and methods courses.

Professionals in public health, prevention sciences, health sciences, the life sciences, and the social sciences have relied on the field of bioethics when dealing with controversial issues related to (1) individual vs. community rights, (2) analysis of benefits, harms, risks and costs, and (3) ethical issues in global health research.  Students will learn about ethical issues in population health practice, research, and policy. For example, they will examine questions related to individual and community responsibilities during infectious disease outbreaks and man-made or natural disasters. They will consider the ethical implications of various public health practices related to human rights, domestic and international research, resource allocations, security, and genetic/health screenings, as well as other relevant areas.  Students will complete the Bioethics M.A. curriculum and the M.P.H. curriculum except that students in the combined program will be allowed to double-count courses as follows:  Through the dual degrees program, the two degrees can be obtained with a total of 60 earned credits, as compared with the 75 credits required if the degrees are obtained separately.

This is the program mission.  In this regard, strong health systems are used as the cornerstone for addressing the vulnerabilities, health inequalities and limited access to health care associated with disasters.

    "body": "  ## From First Job to CEO: Alumnus Patrick Boyle Explains His Journey at Miller’s Health Systems  Patrick Boyle, president and CEO of Miller’s Health Systems, joined the company in 1984 immediately after graduating with a degree in Health Care Administration from Indiana University.  His journey at Miller’s has allowed him to serve in many capacities, but being adaptable is something he learned early on. While in college, Boyle lost his dad to cancer, causing him and his brother to have to work a multitude of jobs as students.  “I washed dishes at the General Motors plant in Anderson, shelved books in the school library in Bloomington, dipped ice cream at Baskin Robbins, and spent two summers as an intern at the State Prison in Pendleton,” providing quite the contrast in experiences, Boyle said. “I had quite a variety of jobs, but each one provided me with more understanding of different age groups, socioeconomic levels, and viewpoints – knowledge I would need and use in the years to come.”  Following college, Boyle started his career at Miller’s in operations as a licensed health facility administrator. He then spent eight years taking on different roles in five of Miller’s health care facilities, and later joined their corporate marketing division. In 1995, he became a regional vice president, and held that position until 2000 when he became the president and CEO.  “I learned many lessons along the way – from our leadership teams, our facility staff, and the tens of thousands of patients and families we served,” Boyle said.  In 2007, under Boyle’s leadership, Miller’s Health Systems created an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) to purchase the operating company from the Miller family, making it the second largest employee-owned health care company in the country.  Due to how the Miller family established the ESOP, no employee has to pay for their eligible stock – the company picks up the expense.  “I have the opportunity to lead a group of very talented leaders who are among the best at what they do,” Boyle said. “Together, we’re part of a workforce of nearly 3500 employee-owners around the state.”  A day in the life  If there’s anything routine about Boyle’s daily duties as president and CEO, it’s that there’s nothing routine about it.  One day he may be standing at a construction site going over details of a new addition to one of the therapy gyms; the next day he could be at the state capital meeting with state representatives, or in Washington meeting with Congress members about the challenges facing the health care industry.  The next day he could be visiting with patients, serving lunch to a hard-working group of employees who have received a deficiency-free survey from the Indiana State Department of Health, or simply sitting at his desk approving capital expenditures or answering emails. One thing he says is for certain, however, is that every day is different and challenging.  “There’s no denying that the post-acute world is challenging,” Boyle said. “Reimbursement cuts, employee shortages and rule changes can make it difficult as a provider and as a leader. However, caring for patients at the times when they need help the most, watching your employees grow personally and professionally, and helping families when they have no other options more than compensates for the daily headaches.”  Presently, one out of every six jobs is in the healthcare field, said Boyle, who suggests that those thinking about entering the post-acute arena try gaining exposure through job shadowing or working part time in the organization to decide if it’s an area to pursue.  “It is vital to try and understand the company’s culture,” he said. “Your personal values as a future leader need to be aligned with the core values of the company so that you can always be true to yourself.  Most importantly, never stop growing personally and professionally, from the first day on the job until you reach your retirement and beyond.”  Learning from those who paved the way  While in college, Boyle completed two practicums/internships. His first was at Bloomington Hospital with CEO Bud Kohr.  “Bud was a great inspiration and he allowed me to work with different leaders inside the hospital. He made me feel like I was just as important as any other team member of the hospital. He taught me life lessons and I was fortunate to be one of his interns.  “The second Internship I had was at St. John’s Hospital in Anderson, Indiana. I was very blessed to do a practicum/internship with a sharp young supervisor who consistently looked for improvements in each division he was responsible for.”  Boyle also had professors in college who were influential in his success, two of which stand out in his memory: Dr. Terry Zollinger, professor emeritus at Fairbanks School of Public Health, and Dr. Frank Vilardo, associate professor emeritus at the Paul H. O’Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs.  “Both professors were very encouraging and I appreciated the time they would spend with all of us when we had questions or sought advice about future jobs in our field. Even now, all these years later, I will hear these professors’ names and know that their impact is still present on campus.”  Throughout the last ten years, Boyle too, has paid it forward by serving as a guest lecturer to IUPUI students in the health administration classes. His advice to students and recent graduates pursuing a health administration career is what he’s continued to do since beginning his 36-year career.  “One of the principles I learned in college has become a core value throughout my entire career: being adaptable. Not all of your plans and events come together when you are an 18-year-old freshman, and that is true when you are a 57-year-old CEO. Some of your best plans just don’t materialize.  “Sometimes it is out of your control, such as when a new rule cuts government funding. Or maybe you’ve underestimated the depth of a situation and didn’t appropriate the needed resources. No matter the reason, you and your team have to adapt to what is in front of you… and own your results. Don’t get too high when you knock it out of the park or too low when you miss the mark – just stay hungry and attempt to improve each and every day.” "

Establishing FSPH marked a significant transition from a historically teaching-oriented program to one with a greater balance between teaching, research, and service. As such, the past years have entailed hiring research-oriented faculty at all ranks, with many of these positions going to junior investigators with strong postdoctoral experiences.  Each of these new faculty received competitive start-up packages to bolster the launch of their career at IU. FSPH has grown its small departmental research portfolio, with six awards totaling less than $200k in 2010, to a robust school portfolio of 150 awards of Federal grant support between 2016 and 2021, for a total funding of approximately $40 million.

Public health leadership has been analyzed and written about, but few studies have examined the personal characteristics and experiences of state health leaders and what their leadership looks like in the context of their state.  The SHO-CASE Study is the first national resource of state health official historical data gathered to better understand and analyze the qualities and backgrounds of potential candidates, to best prepare them for the job and to avoid career derailment.   ### SHO-CASE Study  Study of state and territorial health officers and historic database including videos, articles, publications, learning guides, infographic and pocket guides.   ### Addressing factors that affect health care costs: recommendations for Indiana stakeholders  Rising health care costs are of concern to Indiana consumers, employers, policymakers, health care providers, and other health care stakeholders, especially because of poor health outcomes in the state. Several recent analyses have elevated the discussion about the prices of hospital care in our state. However, many factors contribute to overall health care costs beyond price. Any policy interventions, based upon a limited understanding of the larger context, unnecessarily risks positioning stakeholders against each other without addressing the overall problem. This report is motivated by the need to move Indiana towards lower overall health care costs especially through concerted efforts that will improve the health of Hoosiers.   #### Cost of Care Study  Addressing Factors that Affect Health Care Costs: Recommendations for Indiana Stakeholders "

    "body": "  ## Internship Experience Now a Requirement for BS in Health Services Management Students  Ensuring its students are prepared for current marketplace needs and demands, the Bachelor of Science in Health Services Management (BSHSM) program at the IU Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health has made several changes to its curriculum requirements.  One of the most notable changes, is the requirement for all Health Services Management majors to complete an internship. According to BSHSM program director, Sarah Johnson, data from the IUPUI First Destination Survey, a graduation survey, show that graduates who completed an internship were significantly less likely to still be seeking employment after graduation, and reported significantly higher starting salaries.  “And BS in Health Services Management graduation outcomes follow this trend,” Johnson said.  As industry needs evolve, real-world experience and application have become a top priority for the program, making undergraduate internships a useful and necessary tool for student success.  “We want our students to be competitive and feel strongly that completing an internship will help them gain an edge,” Johnson said.  The internship is now one of three related courses BSHSM majors must complete before graduating. The three-course sequence, taken in their final semesters of study, also consist of a career preparation course that is taken prior to the internship in order to set students up for success.  Following the internship, students will also take the new Health Services Management capstone course that builds on the professional experiences they will have had in their internship. The capstone course will allow students to apply concepts learned throughout the program to case scenarios and prepare them to make the transition from student to professional.  Johnson also shared that, in the updated curriculum, students will now be required to take Health Economics, as well as Health Care Marketing, two courses that were previously electives. “We want to be sure we are aligning our curriculum with Association of University Programs in Health Administration (AUPHA) standards.”  The program’s course and internship requirements will be effective for students entering the program for the fall semester of 2018. If your organization is interested in preparing the next generation of health care leaders, contact Sarah Johnson at shm@iu.edu to learn more about hosting interns from the BS in Health Services Management program at Fairbanks School of Public Health.

The B.S. degree in Health Services Management has attracted top students into the honors track and has created a close-knit community of students working and challenging each other to make an impact on the IUPUI campus, Indianapolis and the world.  Junior Health Services Management student Katie McDonald feels that the honors program has created new opportunities for her. “I have been able to work one-on-one with faculty to complete my honors projects for the given semester and gain relationships I wouldn't have been able to otherwise. My favorite so far was researching big data in healthcare with Professor Menachemi. This topic is developing rapidly and I didn't know a thing about it when I entered his class. The honors program helped me get to know more about the Fairbanks School of Public Health and I also met a lot of new people in other honors programs throughout IUPUI.”  Fairbanks honors students must have a minimum GPA of 3.5 and be enrolled full-time. Students must complete honor’s projects within their major and elective courses which include work beyond the regular course requirements. The honor’s program is another way we are attracting the brightest students and preparing them for successful careers in health administration. "

He wanted to be in the healthcare industry, but also wanted to study business. After learning about the Health Services Management program, Tyler realized it was a perfect combination of the two.  Tyler started the Bachelor of Science in Health Services Management (BSHSM) program and hit the ground running. “As a student, I completed several internships. The first internship I had was on the insurance side for Bankers Life. My second internship was in data management for a local company called Cooperative Managed Care Services.”  Using what he learned both inside and out of the classroom, Tyler started working at the IU School of Medicine immediately after graduating.  I was first hired on as a Regulatory Specialist, but I wanted to get into a position that worked with budgets and numbers. And I eventually did!  Today, Tyler assists MDs and PhDs with grant funding throughout the life of a grant, helping to construct their budgets and guide them along the application process (following federal guidelines). He also manages the day-in, day-out side of each grant account, updating projections and managing effort.  “I use many aspects of my Health Services Management education within my job, including the skill of budget construction and management, the knowledge of various governmental agencies such as NIH, NIAAA, and through time management skills I’ve learned.”  Though Tyler is unsure of his long-term goals, he knows he wants to continue his education by pursuing a Master’s in Business Administration.

In addition to teaching and interacting with students, which is her favorite thing to do, she will be focused on creating awareness of the program in the region.  “I will also be focused on further developing relationships with stakeholders in the Fort Wayne area, both for internships and engagement opportunities for students, as well as how the HSM program can fit into the broader community for the good of everyone,” said Dr. Robertson, who stressed the city’s need for more healthcare administrators.  “Fort Wayne's healthcare community is absolutely booming, and there's a real need for healthcare administrators in the area, but many in the community are unaware of the value (or even the existence) of a health services management degree. I'm hoping we can change that and demonstrate our value quickly and effectively.”  Dr. Robertson said she is thrilled to join a well-established and well-regarded program, with all of the attendant resources and opportunities for students.  “Since the program will be within the Fairbanks School of Public Health, but located in Fort Wayne, my role will also include ensuring active and continuous engagement between the two campuses,” she said. “I could not be more excited to be a part of the new wave of health education IU Fort Wayne is bringing to the region.” "

    "body": "  ## Become the next champion of public and population health  *We are no longer admitting students to this accelerated degree track. Students admitted to the BSPH program for fall 2023 and beyond should refer to the updated BSPH-MPH program track .  The accelerated 4+1 MPH in Epidemiology allows you to graduate with both Bachelor of Science in Public Health and Master of Public Health degrees in epidemiology in just five years.  This program is one year less than the traditional six-year path of obtaining a bachelor’s and master’s degree, saving time and money and giving you the specialized skills and experience needed to be the next champion of public and population health.  This accelerated program combines the foundations of public health and principles of the epidemiological method (of the BSPH degree) with the public health systems, academic theory, research and real-world experience of the MPH degree. The 4+1 accelerated program may also be combined with pre-professional coursework.   ### Plan of study  You will complete three years of bachelor’s degree requirements. During your third year, you will apply for the accelerated program. If accepted into the accelerated program, you will complete your first year of MPH coursework during what would have been your fourth year of undergraduate study.  That MPH coursework takes the place of your final BSPH required courses. You will then graduate with your bachelor’s degree the spring after your first year in the MPH program.   ### Curriculum  BSPH–MPH in Epidemiology pre-professional curriculum   ### Eligibility  The accelerated program is a competitive opportunity for outstanding public health students. To be eligible, you must have a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.5 and a B or higher in the following courses: PBHL-P109, PBHL-B300, PBHL-E330 (Evidence-Based Public Health), PBHL-E322, and PBHL-E422.  Prior to the start of your senior year, you must have all but five major applications courses completed for your BSPH degree; these courses will be replaced with MPH courses taken the first year of the MPH program or last year of the BSPH program.  If you meet the above criteria you are not guaranteed admission. All elements of the application including letters of recommendation, scores, GPA, résumé, interview, and personal statement will be taken into consideration.   ### When to apply  You are encouraged to apply during the spring semester of your junior year; however, the deadline for accelerated BSPH-MPH applications is June 1. As an accepted BSPH-MPH accelerated student, you will matriculate into the MPH program during the fall semester of your senior year.   ### How to apply  You should complete the application in the spring semester of your junior year by the application deadline.  Accelerated application form  [Accelerated application form](https://iu.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_e2jvZ0DCWl67XBs)  Accelerated application form example  You are strongly encouraged to meet with your academic advisor early to begin planning.

    "body": "  ## Alumni Career Profile: Viola Long  BS in Health Services Management, 2016 Current Title: Practice Operations Assistant Current Employer: IU Health Physicians  Viola was originally focused on pre-med. After almost three years and speaking with multiple people, she found out about the Bachelor of Science in Health Services Management (BSHSM) program.  “At first, I was reluctant to change majors because I was not sure what I could do with this degree. I did my own research and spoke with my peers and others in the medical field and was amazed with the many opportunities a Health Services Management degree could provide.”  Viola always knew she wanted to work in healthcare because she always had a passion for helping and inspiring others.  “Once I realized I could still make a difference in healthcare without being frontline, there was no turning back for me.”  Healthcare is never ending and always evolving. As a future healthcare leader, Viola feels it is very pertinent to evolve with it.  I've had to make ethical decisions, use and understand emotional intelligence, and make decisions that don’t only affect me. And I have so many people from IUPUI to thank for helping me with that.  In fact, Viola says she learned so many things in undergrad that have helped with her experience.  Outside of class, she learned how important networking is. She had always been social, and learned that she could help bring that out in others.  “I have gained so many long term friendships and relationships with other professionals that I may have never made if I didn't move to Indianapolis and come to IUPUI – one of the best decisions I’ve made.”  Networking and using what she learned in the program is what helped Viola land a position with IU Health. “My first role upon graduation was as a Practice Operations Assistant for Riley Children's Hospital, but I later transferred departments for development and more opportunities.”  She has worked for three different divisions within IU Health and currently works for the Digestive and Liver Disorders clinic to assist multiple physicians, managing multiple areas of the department for various providers.  “I am constantly developing within my role and taking on more leadership tasks, such as facilitating daily huddles for my office and becoming part of different groups. I've learned to look at the bigger picture and realize that there are issues bigger than myself. Doing work for the greater good is what healthcare is all about.”  Viola’s ultimate goal is to become the CEO of a hospital. Leading up to that position, she plans to progress and become aware of as many different areas in healthcare as possible. She truly believes that in order to become a great CEO and leader, she must experience and understand different roles. As a leader, she wouldn't want to make decisions that affect others without understanding their responsibilities on a daily basis.  “I plan to be the best at what I do and always inspire others to do the same while changing healthcare one step at a time.”  Learn About the BSHSM Program   ## Alumni Career Profiles "

Yes, you must have your test scores sent to SOPHAS.  I have degrees and/or coursework from Indiana University. Do I need to have my IU transcripts sent to apply for the PhD program? Yes, you must have your transcripts sent to SOPHAS.  If I have a master's degree from an American university, do I have to submit scores for the TOEFL exam? A bachelor's or higher degree from a country designated by IUPUI as predominantly native-English speaking is required to exempt you from taking the TOEFL exam or providing other acceptable proof of English proficiency.  Is it necessary for me to take the English Placement test? Applicants providing proof of a score 100 or higher on the TOEFL exam, or 7.5 on the IELTS exam are exempt from the requirement to take the EAP exam at IUPUI . Applicants with lower scores are required to take the English for Academic Purposes (EAP) exam.  [EAP exam at IUPUI](https://liberalarts.iupui.edu/english/pages/eap-program-folder/index.php)  I would like to know if my degree is the equivalent of an American university BA or BS degree. Can you tell me if I can be admitted with my current degree? The SOPHAS application system requires a World Education Services (WES) ICAP course-by-course evaluation for all post-secondary foreign institutions attended. The admissions committee will use this document to guide them in their decisions for international students. When the committee recommends admission for an international applicant, IUPUI’s Office of International Affairs will conduct their own evaluation to finalize the admission process.  When are admissions decisions made? Applications for the Epidemiology PhD program will be reviewed by the program's admissions committee after the December 15 application deadline. The committee may conduct face-to-face interviews with applicants and require a writing sample. When the interview process is completed, the committee will make its final decisions. Students are typically notified of their admission status in March.  How are the admissions decisions made? The admissions committee uses the submitted application material to assess an applicant’s scientific leadership potential and ability to engage in advanced graduate work. In addition, the admissions committee will compare the applicant’s career goals and objectives with the mission of the Epidemiology PhD program. Scientific leadership potential is assessed using the applicant's résumé/curriculum vita, personal statement, and personal interview. Ability to engage in advanced graduate work is assessed using the applicant's personal interview, letters of recommendation, overall grade point average in prior graduate work, and scores from the GRE or other graduate entrance exams. Learning goals and objectives are assessed using the applicant's personal statement and personal interview.  I received a letter from the department stating that I have been accepted to the Epidemiology PhD program. Do I have to return the enclosed \"Intent to Accept / Decline\" form? Yes, you are required to complete and return the \"Intent to Accept / Decline\" by the deadline indicated on the form.  Can I transfer graduate course credits to the Epidemiology PhD program? IU Graduate School policy allows up to 30 credit hours from graduate level courses to be transferred to a PhD program. Once accepted, students may request to have courses transferred from another accredited university or program if they received a grade of \"B\" or better in the courses. The Epidemiology PhD program director and faculty will review and approve or deny requests for transfer. Requests are evaluated on a case by case basis.  I have a master's degree in public health. Can courses that I've taken in my master's program fulfill any PhD requirements? Once accepted into the Epidemiology PhD program, students will be assigned a faculty advisor. Advisors will review previously completed coursework to determine if any requirements for the PhD program have already been met. Based on this assessment, faculty advisors will work with students to identify the rest of the courses needed to complete the PhD program.  I was accepted to the Epidemiology PhD program. Do I need to meet with my graduate advisor prior to enrolling in courses? Yes. A faculty advisor will be assigned to you upon acceptance into the program. You will need to talk with your advisor before registering for classes in the fall. If you are unable to meet in person, you can make an appointment for a telephone conversation.

Public health leadership has been analyzed and written about, but few studies have examined the personal characteristics and experiences of state health leaders and what their leadership looks like in the context of their state.  In partnership with Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO) and the de Beaumont Foundation , this project explores the experience of SHOs through interviews, surveys, and research.  [Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO)](http://www.astho.org/)  [de Beaumont Foundation](https://www.debeaumont.org/)  By determining the model of a successful SHO, governors and secretaries will have a national resource of state health official historical data to better understand and analyze the qualities and backgrounds of potential candidates, to best prepare them for the job and to avoid career derailment.  Over the next year, the project team will share their findings through a series of presentations, articles, and more.

SHO Pocket Guide  SHO Governor Pocket Guide  Infographic   ### Videos  Current and former state health officials share their individual experiences as health leaders, and provide insights and advice for aspiring SHOs and anyone interested in the role of state health officials or public health leadership.  Description of the video:  Ed:            What does success look like to you as you reflect back on your tenure as a state health director?    John:         I think that the biggest indicator of success is being able to point to some sign, some concrete sign that health actually improved as a result of actions that I took, or I took in partnership with other people at the department. Ideally, that's improved health and some indication that people were healthier as a result of our policies or our programs. It may be other surrogate markers that are suggestive of success, but I think that would be the gold standard. I'd settle for a silver standard that had to do with improving awareness, knowledge, perhaps attitudes in some measurable way, that were more supportive of public health or of activities that would promote health.    Hugh:         What's your definition of success? What's success in public health for a state health officer?    Nicole:       For a state health official, in my view, success means that you're able to bring some of your own skillsets, talents, gifts and abilities to a state public health agency; be able to embed with and add to the expertise that already exists there; and advance that agency to another level prior to leaving. For example, from my perspective, our agency had a real focus on health equity. And my entire career has involved a commitment to eliminating disparities, and achieving health equity, and making sure that there is equitable access to services and care for people. Bringing those together has been a signature goal for me, to be able to make sure that our Health Equity Zones Initiative that the department had already birthed, that I was able to join with and take to the next level in promoting it at the state level, is successful. We want it to be successful. We want it to be sustained. For me, one of the demonstrations of success will be that by the time I leave the Health Equity Zones Initiative it is not only successful, institutionalized, and well-embedded into our state system with sustainable funding for making the difference that it's intended to, going forward.    Ed:              What does success look like to you when you reflect back on your term as the director of                        the state health department in Maryland?    Benjamin:   Well, my goals when I was coming in as a state health official—I had come in as being the                          Deputy, and I moved to being Secretary—I absolutely wanted to make sure that I had                     ultimately improved the health of the people in Maryland. That was my ultimate goal. We                                were really excited, because we actually think we achieved it while I was there.    Ed:             What in your mind’s eye does success look like when you think back about your term as a                        State Health Official?\"    Devlin:       Well, Ed, when I look back on my years as a State Health Official and think about what                             success looks like, I remember that we chose a few priorities, because there are so many                            issues in public health that need to be addressed, and that we're working on. But, I decided                               what were the things that I wanted to be able to say, \"During my time, we made a difference                  on school health; on preparedness, on disparities, and building the public health                                     infrastructure was another priority, and working on Women and Children's issues.\" So, we                            had those five broad priority areas and how do we move policy? Were we able to put new                      programs or shore up existing services? What were the partnerships we developed, and did                            we have impact in the end through those different strategies?  Hugh:        Let’s just start off with your definition of success. What’s a… What is a successful state health,                officer?    Engel:        Well, I have to look at my environment, which is the state of North Carolina, and, I think, in                     my state, the Health Director role is, actually, defined in statute, and it has to be a physician                  licensed in that state. That is, pretty much, it. But, in reality, in my time, I think, the success                              was a dual role. The Health Director needed to wear the hat of the Surgeon General, that is,                  the subject matter in the public health science of the state, and the second role, is a leader                           and manager of a very division, within the department of Health and Human Services, that                     division being the division of Public Health. So, I think, success was mainly due to wearing                       those two hats, simultaneously, being that valued, trusted, credible public health scientist, as                     well as a really good manager leading a very complicated division, and an even more                                       complicated department.    Hugh:        What is success?    Halverson: It’s interesting.  I’ll answer that question by first telling you a bit of a story.  When I first                          arrived in Arkansas as the State Health Commissioner you may remember it was after the                          unfortunate and untimely death of Dr. Fay Boozman who was in that role and died in a farm                      accident.  That, in and of itself you know, was a public health issue.  When I first came to be in                that role, I had a chance to go around to all of our 75 counties and 93 offices.  I did that over a      year but one of the first trips I made I actually went to a rural part of Arkansas and had a                              chance to really drive in the neighborhoods in small towns.  Usually that meant going on dirt                  roads.  Frequently it meant just trying to get a sense of where people live and what their                             conditions were that they lived in every day.  Inherently, I knew it was different than what I                        lived at.  What I found was and I’ll never get it out of my mind was children playing in a dirty                  street and there was just something about it.  As I talked to people in the community I                      discovered that many of these kids hadn’t had anything to eat and there really were                                 problems in terms of malnutrition and just not having the sense that they will really have a                     full meal.  Not really having the advantages, I think, that a lot of people.  We would all like to                  say that our kids can grow up and have a carefree life and these kids didn’t.  It was interesting               to me.  It set the stage for what to me is success and that is being able to intervene, to create                             the conditions under which people really can be healthy.  To me, take it another step forward               and say it’s really about giving kids hope, right?  Not just the kids, but their parents.  As we all                      live together in communities it seems to me that one of the most important things that we                     could strive for in terms of public health is the success of providing the opportunity for                  people to have hope that tomorrow will be better than today.  That there is reason to believe        that because of public health there is a better tomorrow.  I’m sorry, maybe it sounds corny.                   To me, it was a driving force to say, “You know, we can do better than this.”  So that has been           on my mind along with a number of other things about how I wanted to change the way that                  we lived, worked, played and worked together as a community.    Hugh:        What is your definition of success for a state health officer?    Harmon:    I think the first thing is to have a successful relationship with different leadership bodies in                     the state.  The Governor’s Office, the legislature, the local health departments, the non-                          profits so that you can have a successful agenda with your legislation.  Your budget is very                              important and the different programs.  Then with all of that to be able to continue in your job               for a reasonable period of time so that you have long enough to bring those programs and                             initiatives to a successful completion and continuation.    Hugh:        As a state health officer, what does success mean? What is a successful state health officer?    Lloyd:       Well, times have changed so much, as you know, Hugh. We have a situation now where most                 of the health officers are at super agencies. I think one of the greatest parts of being a health                           officer in Connecticut is I reported directly to the governor, which was Tom Meskill and then                     Ella Grasso. When she died, that was Bill O'Neill.    Hugh:       What was success?    Lloyd:       Well, we were very successful in many different ways. First of all, we had the first hospice in                   the United States in Branford. I've been back to see that several times. I remember the day we     got a call on the Lyme arthritis. Annie was my secretary. She said, \"There's this woman on the                  line, and she's nearly hysterical because of these large things on her.\" It was Lyme arthritis,                    named for Lyme, Connecticut. We were the second state in the United States to have a rate                       setting commission. That was back in the days of certificate of need. Of course, they don't do                        that now; they negotiate with health plans. We were the second state in the country to have                 an EMS system. Indiana, I think, was the first.    Hugh:       What’s your definition of success as a State Health Officer? What is that?    Lumpkin:  I think success of a Public Health Officer at the state level is threefold to the extent that they                 create the conditions in which local public health can be successful. Health and public health                         occurs at the local level where people live, learn, work and play. The State Health Agency’s                             primary job is to make sure that that happens at the local level and that could occur through                 working through local health agencies or through direct action by the State Health Agency                     itself. The second measure of success is to the extent in which the broader health context is                        addressed. That means initially working with other state agencies whose primary purpose may                not be health, but who have a direct impact upon the health of the people in that state. That                    includes the Department of Education, Department of Transportation, as well as others that                        are more likely suspects like Human Services. Then, the third measure of success is the extent                in which the Public Health Director, the Public Health Official improves the functioning of their            agency through adoption of quality-improvement methods, through the focus on innovation                      and a persistence of focus upon the workforce to help improve the qualifications and capacity                            of that workforce to be able to carry out our continuing public health mission.    Hugh:       What is your definition of a successful state health officer?    Monroe:  I have to tell you, Hugh, my definition of a successful state health officer is someone, to be                     honest, first and foremost, that enjoys the job and enjoys engaging with the public, and with                        the legislators, and with their governor and all the stakeholders, because I think that's one of                        the keys to success. Going from there, if you get those relationships well established and                        you're enjoying it, then you can take on the challenges. Honestly, as a state health officer you                   do want to see some policy advance. So that's one of the successes is if you've advanced really                           good public health policy in your state, which is not an easy thing to accomplish, by the way. If                you get the stakeholders and the coalitions, begin to build coalitions or promote coalitions             that have already been established that are actually doing good work, I think that's another       characteristic of a successful state health officer.    Hugh:    I'd love to hear your definition of success from your own experience and maybe a few of the      factors that you think made you successful.    Mary:     Approaching that term \"success\" is very interesting when you're at the state level because, depending on the issue, it might be a very quick issue with a quick turnaround, and what you're hoping is that you're really going to have a longer-term impact on the population in your state. As I think about success it's always wonderful to have hindsight and to look back and say, what was that thing that really made a difference? I was very fortunate that I got to serve multiple governors for a number of years. And a big issue for us was tobacco prevention, for example, but it took 10 years to see what difference that made. We did get a smoke-free state, and you see that pretty quickly. You do get some numbers that tell you kids are starting to smoke less. But you're looking for, what's that health impact? And as we got more adults to quit we actually saw a reduction in respiratory diseases showing up in hospitals. Success can look like an epidemiology curve. Success can be a good headline that thanks the department of health for doing something very well. Success can also be an okay nod from a governor giving you an attagirl or an attaboy for following through on something that was very tough.           ### Publications   #### Public Health Senior Deputy’s Perceptions of State Health Of cials’ Success Factors: Professional Characteristics, Personal Attributes, and Signs of Derailment  This study examines senior deputies’ perceptions of SHO success factors through focus group.

Your Story. Latino Youth Summit (YLYS).  YLYS is an intervention study to increase resilience and self-mastery in Latino adolescents, with the aim of reducing and/or preventing depressive symptoms. It's an evidence-based, interdisciplinary, community-based yearlong program that just completed its first phase, which consisted of a one-week summer camp where Latino youth went through a resilience-building curriculum, followed by a selection of art and movement based activities to develop goals for the future and identify barriers and opportunities.  After one week of camp, preliminary data suggest that the YLYS camp had a statistically significant impact on participants with an increase in resilience (p =.04) and a decrease in depression (p =.003 (KADS-11) and p = .014 (PHQ-4)). The research team will meet with YLYS adolescents once per month for booster sessions.  Additionally, several of these monthly meetings will include programming for parents which was an expressed need from the original ASAP pilot study.   ### Partners   ### Faculty Involved  Silvia M.

In February, Dr. Gatimaitan transitioned from Chief Executive Officer for IU Health Arnett to Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer for IU Health.  As a healthcare administrator, Dr. Gatmaitan says he is thankful for the opportunity to create an environment where intelligent, dedicated and compassionate physicians and nurses can be their best. “While a profession in healthcare administration can be complicated and complex it is heartwarming when I hear a story of remarkable care being provided to a patient, knowing that indirectly I was able to serve the patient.”  Dr. Gatmaitan is excited to be on what he refers to as the cusp of a golden age of healthcare. He anticipates that information technology will transform healthcare by addressing long-standing frustrations and that precision medicine will allow future healthcare administrators tremendous opportunity to change and support the environment for all clinicians.  “Healthcare is more dynamic than ever,” Dr. Gatmaitan said. “The ranges of possible roles for healthcare administrators are open for innovation and change.”  Dr. Gatmaitan has a doctoral degree in health services administration from the University of Alabama at Birmingham and a bachelor’s degree from the University of Dayton.

    "body": "  # IRHA and IUI ECHO Center collaborate to expand the availability of medication-assisted treatment for various SUDs  Tuesday, September 05, 2023  Terre Haute, Ind. (September 1, 2023) — The Indiana Rural Health Association (IRHA) is thrilled to announce its successful acquisition of the Rural Communities Opioid Response Medication Assisted Treatment Access Program funding from the esteemed Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). This funding marks a significant step forward in the ongoing battle against Substance Use Disorders (SUDs) in rural areas.  Over the course of three years, IRHA, in collaboration with its partners LifeSpring Health Systems and the Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health (FSPH) ECHO Center, will be at the helm of an initiative aimed at expanding the availability of medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for various SUDs. This initiative will be executed by establishing five permanent MAT access points and a mobile unit access point strategically positioned within the targeted service area.  The rural counties that will be directly benefited by this program include Orange, Crawford, Perry, Spencer, and Harrison. This endeavor will culminate in amplifying MAT access, obliterating geographic barriers, and bridging the gap between treatment and those in need.  One of the primary challenges faced in these rural communities is the impediment posed by transportation and distance to essential care. The strategic placement of additional MAT access points is a decisive response to this challenge, providing a diversified range of treatment avenues. The secured funding will also facilitate support for indigent care and medications, ensuring that even those financially constrained can access vital MAT prescriptions.  Under the astute leadership of Amnah Anwar, MPH, MBBS, the IRHA team will orchestrate this groundbreaking endeavor. Lauren Perryman, LCSW, Senior Vice President of Recovery and Forensic Services, heads the accomplished LifeSpring Health Systems team. Additionally, the exceptional team at the FSPH ECHO Center, led by Andrea Janota, MPH, Director of the Indiana University Indianapolis (IUI) ECHO Center, will bring its expertise to bear on this transformative initiative.  A Peer Recovery Specialist ECHO program will be established in parallel with this program, further cementing IRHA's commitment to a holistic approach to recovery. This initiative is set to dismantle multiple barriers to MAT access, culminating in a significant stride towards improved healthcare equity and community well-being.

The 50th Anniversary of the Master in Health Administration program is in 2019 and as a special part of this event, we would love to present stories and images that help tell the history of our program from the perspectives of students and alumni like you.   ### 2018 Graduation  61 BS in Health Services Management Graduates  19 Master of Health Administration Graduates   ### Graduation Video: Naqeeb Rahman  Description of the video:  Description of the following video:  [Video: Background music begins.] [Video: Naqeeb walks across the IUPUI campus on a sunny day.] Naqeeb speaks: My name is Naqeeb Rahman, I go to IUPUI, and my major is health services management. [Video: Naqeeb continues walking on campus.] Naqeeb speaks: I am originally from Fishers, Indiana. My parents are from Bangladesh. [Video: Naqeeb sits in a conference room. We then see him crossing a street on the IUPUI campus and walking on a sidewalk in front of a building.] [Words appear: Naqeeb Rahman, IUPUI] Naqeeb speaks: I decided to choose health services management as my major because at a young age I was exposed to hospitals, whether it being family, friends, a newborn baby, somebody being injured, anything like that. I became appreciative of the environment and the professionalism of the staff and doctors there. [Video: Naqeeb sits behind large desk with a computer in the IUPUI Testing Center. A male student walks up, and Naqeeb greets him with a smile. The student brings Naqeeb a large, secure red bag, which Naqeeb unlocks. Then Naqeeb looks at some information on his computer screen.] Naqeeb speaks: So I knew that I wanted a career in that kind of field. I realized that most of the professions, the careers, and the people that I needed to get to know, they were all in downtown Indianapolis, so I chose to go to IUPUI. [Video: Naqeeb leans back in his computer chair, smiling and speaking to someone off screen. We then see him sitting in the conference room again.] Naqeeb speaks: One thing that I'm very proud of about IUPUI is the chance I had to make connections with some of the professors here. [Video: Naqeeb sits in a classroom, having a discussion with his instructor and classmates.] Naqeeb speaks: When I first got to IUPUI, I wasn't a very outgoing person. I decided it can only be beneficial for me to talk to my professors and get to know them and let them know that I'm interested in the field that I'm in and I'm actually interested in what they're teaching. [Video: Naqeeb sits down in the classroom, picks up his mobile phone, and looks at something on his computer. He continues to work on his laptop during class.] Naqeeb speaks: After I decided that I could talk to them, I created relationships with most if not all of my professors, and they helped me with my letters of recommendation, they helped me with internship searches, with job opportunities. [Video: Naqeeb walks across a skybridge with a group of his friends, one of whom is holding some pizza boxes. Naqeeb playfully tricks his friend into looking away so that he can take a piece of pizza as they walk, but his friend catches him and closes the box. The group is shown sitting down at a table inside and eating, and another friend arrives. Naqeeb offers her some of the pizza.] Naqeeb speaks: Outside of the classroom, I attend events like the the ISCA, the Indian Student Cultural Association, the African-American Student Association, and Asian Heritage Student Association. [Video: Naqeeb and his friends eat pizza and play a card game. Then the group gathers together around the table so that one of Naqeeb's friends can take a selfie of the whole group.] Naqeeb speaks: With that I got a lot of different perspectives on different cultures and different religions. It made me feel at home because since I was exposed to all of the different religions and perspectives and cultures, I was able to connect with a lot more people on campus, and because of that, I felt, like, a strong, genuine connection. [Video: We see the exterior of Lucas Oil Stadium. Naqeeb and his family pose for a photo outside of the stadium before the IUPUI Commencement ceremony begins. Then we see Naqeeb by himself in his cap and gown in front of the stadium, and then taking a selfie with some friends.] Naqeeb speaks: After graduation, I plan on getting my master's in health administration. I'm interested in long-term care, so I would like to work in retirement facilities, nursing homes, assisted living homes. [Video: Naqeeb receives his diploma at the IUPUI Commencement ceremony. Then we see him playing cards with his friends, and then in class laughing with his instructor and classmates.] Naqeeb speaks: IUPUI has helped me with preparing for my future in various ways. One of the best ways they've prepared me is learning how to connect with people. All of the professors actually encourage you to go out and talk to bosses and talk to your coworkers and form relationships with them. [Video: Naqeeb turns the tassel on his cap from right to left. We see him walking into the stadium and observing the crowd.] Naqeeb speaks: Because of all of that, I can see myself excelling.

Dedicating her career to improving health care for vulnerable and underserved populations, Dr. Harris has practiced medicine for 30 years at nationally recognized Eskenazi Health, one of America’s essential health care systems. Today, she leads Eskenazi Health while remaining actively engaged in patient care, research, teaching and the local community as a whole – including the IUPUI community. During this year’s commencement for the Fairbanks School of Public Health, Dr. Harris presented the keynote address.  Long before national health care reform took shape in America, Dr. Harris concentrated Eskenazi Health’s resources on prevention, health promotion and primary care, asserting that the greatest opportunity to improve the health and vitality of a community is to keep people well in the first place. She is intensely focused on improving access to patient-centered, comprehensive, community-based primary and mental health care, health promotion and effective chronic disease management – causes that are equally important to the health policy and management field.  Dr. Harris also serves as associate dean and professor of medicine for the IU School of Medicine. She is a John F. Williams, Jr., M.D. Scholar, and an active leader in the local community, serving as a board member for America’s Essential Hospitals, Regenstrief Institute, American Red Cross of Indiana and more.

    "body": "  ## Internship Spotlight   ### Taylor Walters  BSPH in Health Services Management, 2020 Current Title: Patient Navigator with Ascension Employer: St. Vincent Medical Group  Growing up with a parent who was paraplegic, Taylor had to mature quickly. She learned how to care for her dad and help him do things he had difficulties doing on his own.  “I was surrounded by medical supplies, wheelchairs, renovated car features – things that would help him live his life,” Taylor said. “I loved the feeling I got from helping someone that couldn’t help themselves, the feeling of making a difference in someone’s life.\"  In addition to helping others, Taylor knew she loved doing administration work. That is why she chose Health Services Management as a major.  “I get the best of both worlds – to be in the professional leadership role, while also being around patients and being able to help others.”  Taylor wanted hands-on experience and was fortunate in that she didn’t have to do much searching to find an internship.  “One of my professors actually worked with my former supervisor to create a new internship experience,” she said.  Taylor accepted the new internship opportunity, which was with St. Vincent Medical Group for the summer of 2019. Throughout her time there, she primarily job shadowed, spending time each week with a different department/role within administration. She shadowed a manager of a physician office, social worker, transformation specialist, patient navigators and project manager She also learned about data analysis, quality and community outreach.  “The best part about my internship experience was spending time with the Rural and Urban Access to Health (RUAH) department,” Taylor said.  RUAH is a community-based care coordination program, sponsored by St. Vincent Medical Group, that provides a comprehensive network of health, human and social services. This community outreach team works with lower income individuals and families to assist in needs such as medication assistance, Medicaid, food stamps, translation barriers, uninsured pregnancies and more.  “I loved being a part of the team that helps those in need,” Taylor said. “I also enjoyed being a part of professional meetings on a corporate level. This really allowed me to grasp a good understanding about the organization and what big hurdles, challenges or successes they are going through.”  Taylor said this internship directly impacted her career goals because she was offered (and has accepted) a position with the RUAH department at St. Vincent. She believes it also helped her grow professionally and network with many different people.  “Internships are a fantastic way to not only allow students to get a feel and understanding for what it is like in a professional setting, it also allows the organization to grow and potentially find a prospective new employee,” she said. “Internships also challenge students to apply what they are learning in class to the job that is expected of them.”  Prior to her internship, Taylor worked full-time in retail pharmacy and was stressed about her ability to balance work and an internship over the summer. She ultimately chose to move forward with the internship.  “I am extremely happy I prioritized the internship over my work because in the long run it led me to a career before I even graduate. You never know what might come out of your internship, so for that summer, spring or fall do that internship and do it with confidence. You may be lucky and offered a position when it is over!” "

    "body": "  ## Health Services Management Internship Interview Day - for internship sites  Every fall and spring, the Health Services Management program invites internship sites to participate in Internship Interview Day. The event provides health care organizations and nonprofits the opportunity to interview top internship candidates all in one place at one time.  Recruit for summer 2024 and fall 2024 interns at the next Internship Interview Day: Friday, April 19   ### How it works   ## For internship sites  Amazing, well-prepared, and professional candidates!   ### Recruit your next intern at Internship Interview Day  If your organization is interested in recruiting an intern or interns from the Health Services Management program, please fill out this short form and a member of the Internship Interview Day team will reach out to you with more details.   ### Develop an internship program  Hosting one or more interns at your organization can be both rewarding and beneficial. While providing a student with a life-altering educational experience, you can also provide your organization with a fresh perspective, a future talent pipeline, and additional project capacity.   ### Frequently asked questions   ## Why establish an internship program?  There are many good reasons to consider developing an internship program. Below are some of the reasons why organizations currently work with us to host interns:  For most of our students, their required internship is their first opportunity to work in their future profession. A high percentage of our student population are the first in their family to attend college. This means they may not have had the same opportunities other students have to observe role models working in a professional setting. Post-graduation, many of our students note their internships as being one of the most vital aspects of their educational experience.  In addition to being a great educational opportunity for a student, an internship can function as an applied interview and can give you the chance to test the fit of an individual with your organization. As most students will complete their internship in the final semester of their senior year, the internship can easily transition to full-time employment, though this is not an expectation.  Furthermore, if your organization is interested in investing in local talent the Health Services Management program can be a great fit. Over the last five years, 90-100% of our graduates have chosen to stay and work in Indiana. Additionally, our student population is far more diverse than similar programs in the area and more diverse than the general IU Ft. Wayne student population.  Many organizations see hosting interns as beneficial to their own employees. Not only do interns provide fresh perspectives but providing staff members opportunities to supervise and mentor interns can be a wonderful investment in the professional development of your staff.   ## What types of tasks and projects can an intern work on?  Does your organization have a wish list of projects that you would like to accomplish but have not had the time or manpower? Does a specific department or project need additional support? Hosting an intern might be a solution as it supports the needs of the organization while also providing valuable professional experience to a student.  Think about tasks and projects that can be accomplished with some level of independence following initial training. If nothing specific comes to mind, consider a rotating internship program in which the intern would be able to spend a week or more in several departments assisting with projects and sitting in on meetings. (We would just ask that a single supervisor be identified as the primary point of contact for the intern.)   ## When do internships occur and how long do they last?  Most internships take place over one semester. Interns are expected to work a minimum of 120 hours during their internship. However, many internship sites wish for students to commit to more hours per week to make the experience more meaningful for both parties. At a minimum, an intern would need to work at least 8 hours per week during a fall or spring semester or 11 hours per week during the summer term.  Fall semester: Late-August through mid-December Spring semester: Mid-January through early-May Summer semester: Mid-May through mid-August  *Suggested start and end dates will be provided for each specific semester.  Most students graduate in fall (December) and spring (May), which means internships over the spring and fall semesters will have more candidates to choose from and the ability to hire graduating seniors.   ## What needs to be included in an internship description?  If your organization is unsure how to structure an internship, we would be happy to assist in that development process. Generally, the following elements are included in every internship description:  Examples: Administrative Intern; HR Intern; Quality Improvement Intern; Marketing Intern  Examples: Human Resources; Revenue Cycle; Marketing; Facilities  Options: In-Person, Hybrid, 100% Remote/Virtual  If paid, provide the hourly rate or stipend rate  Example: Intern(s) will develop professional communication skills through the development of project deliverables and interactions with a variety of healthcare professionals.  Examples: One day per week (Fridays from 8am-5pm); 20 hours per week  Provide an overview of what you will expect the intern to work on while in the internship. Example: Provides project support directly or through appropriate delegation project support to the Vice President, Clinical and Revenue Cycle Services. Conducts quantitative analysis to identify themes in large data sets. Researches and offers feedback on improvement efforts and customer satisfaction. Provides general project support for all members of the leadership staff as needed. Interacts with various health center employees and has indirect contact with patients.  Example: Ideal interns will have experience working with data sets and feel confident in Microsoft Excel.   ## Would I need to pay an intern?  Interns can be paid or unpaid. As in all hiring, there is competition for good interns. Typically, internships that offer some form of payment (e.g., hourly pay or stipend) attract the strongest candidates. Additionally, if developing a diverse employee pipeline is a priority for your organization, it is important to remember that many students from diverse backgrounds are financially unable to accept unpaid internship opportunities. The current average hourly rate for an intern in our program is $13-15 per hour.  If your organization is leaning toward establishing an unpaid internship, do take a few minutes to review the U.S. Department of Labor’s Fair Labor Standards Act ( FLSA Fact Sheet #71 ) to ensure your internship would meet the “test for unpaid interns.”  [FLSA Fact Sheet #71](https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs71.htm)   ## What responsibilities would I or someone in my organization have as an internship supervisor?   ## How would my organization recruit an intern?  The Health Services Management program hosts an Internship Interview Day event each fall and spring semester. This is how most of our students will seek their internships. All internship sites planning to secure an intern (or interns) for the upcoming semester are encouraged to participate in this event.  Our streamlined process takes all the recruitment work off your plate and only asks you to send one or more representatives from your organization to interview and rank candidates during the one-day event.   ## Have more questions or want to speak with an internship expert?  Please reach out. We would be happy to answer any specific questions or to work with you on the development of an internship program at your organization. Please contact the Health Services Management program at bshsm@iu.edu .   ### What students say about Internship Interview Day      “Internship Interview Day was such a success! I landed a great internship that I never would have had the opportunity to interview for outside of the event. --Kay’Lei Minor          “Internship Interview Day set me up with an internship that helped provide me with invaluable experience and guidance for my career! It opened my eyes to a world of opportunity!” -- Blake Surface          “The preparation we did in the Career Preparation course helped me feel more confident and prepared going into the interviews. My interviews all went smoothly and I landed a great internship!” -- Sarah Forbes   ### Recruit employees  Our Career Development Office is here to assist employers with recruiting full-time or part-time employees. If you would like to post a full-time or part-time position, attend an upcoming career fair, or schedule on-campus interviews to fill non-internship positions, please reach out to our Career Development Office at fsphcs@iupui.edu .

    "body": "  ## Miller's Health Systems Administrator in Training Program Finds Success Recruiting at the IU Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health  To help undergraduate students take their education and experience to the next level, the IU Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health assists Miller’s Health Systems with recruiting for their Administrator in Training (AIT) program.  In the AIT program, participants complete the required core curriculum, are paired with experienced administrators, and train in various locations over a six- to eight-month period to gain exposure to the many facets of the long-term care industry. The program ultimately prepares participants to pass the state and federal licensure examinations required to become a Health Facility Administrator (HFA).  “The goal is to teach the AITs the state and federal regulations of a long-term care facility, as well as all aspects of operations from resident care standards to business office functions,” said Jaima Eisenhauer, executive director of staff development at Miller's Health Systems. “AITs will spend time training in all departments of the facility operation.”  Eisenhauer explained that an AIT’s initial responsibility is to learn, working through different departments to gain knowledge and experience in the various positions. For example, in one position, an AIT might work side-by-side with dietary staff preparing meals, and in another position work alongside an administrator to prepare a budget or review financial statements. As a BS in Health Services Management student, having the opportunity to develop these skills is important.  When recent BS in Health Services Management graduate, Caitlan Kotowski, first heard about the opportunity in one of her courses, she worked closely with the BSHSM program director, Sarah Johnson, to begin the application process.  After completing an interview on campus and a second interview on site, Caitlan was accepted into Miller’s AIT program and started early this year. While she is still new to the program, she is already making an impression.  “In Caitlan’s short time with us, she has demonstrated exceptional organizational and communication skills,” Eisenhauer said. “She is eager to learn and has been a great addition to our team as a future healthcare leader.”  Successful AITs have excellent communication skills, a passion to serve others, business aptitude, and are adaptable to change. The partnership between Miller’s and the Fairbanks School of Public Health makes the search for such candidates easier.  “Recruiting through the BS in Health Services Management program has been a great experience for us,” Eisenhauer said. “The process has been customized to our needs and we have been able to interact with quality candidates.”  Yet, finding quality candidates for their AIT program is often only the beginning. Miller’s Health Systems selects AITs with the hope that they will one day be successful administrators in their company, which has proven to be a beneficial strategy.  “The AIT program has a history of success, as the majority of our facility administrators and senior leadership started in our AIT program,” Eisenhauer said.  Miller’s Health Systems will be on campus to interview another round of BS students from our Health Services Management program for their AIT program in March.

    "body": "  ## Bill Tierney, MD  Clinical Professor, Associate Dean of Population Health and Health Outcomes   ### Biography  Bill Tierney, MD, is internationally recognized for his research in biomedical informatics, health services and clinical database epidemiology.  During his first 36 years at Indiana University and the Regenstrief Institute, his research focused on developing, implementing, and studying electronic medical records (EHRs) and health information technologies. In 2009-10, he assumed the roles of president and CEO of the Regenstrief Institute, associate dean for comparative effectiveness research at the Indiana University School of Medicine, and chairman of the Department of Internal Medicine for Eskenazi Health, the nation’s fourth-largest safety-net health system, where he had practiced for more than 35 years as a primary care physician, emergency physician and hospitalist.  He also served as the founding director of informatics and research for the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare (AMPATH), a 30+ year collaboration of more than 20 North American universities with Moi University in Kenya. He led the team that developed sub-Saharan Africa’s first ambulatory EHRs which grew into OpenMRS, one of the world’s most widely adopted EHR platforms that has been implemented in more than 50 countries. Dr. Tierney led the team that implemented OpenMRS in Tanzania and Uganda where it is now the national EHR system.  In 2015, Dr. Tierney left IU for the University of Texas at Austin where he was the founding chair of the new Dell Medical School’s Department of Population Health which plays a leading role in the school’s mission to help make Austin a model healthy city. The Department of Population Health focuses on community engagement, health equity, primary care, occupational health, global health and health information and data analytic sciences.  In 2021, Dr. Tierney returned to Indiana University to serve as Associate Dean for Population Health & Health Outcomes at the Fairbanks School of Public Health in its Department of Global Health. He will help lead Fairbanks’ efforts to improve the health and wellbeing of Hoosiers in Central Indiana and statewide.  Tierney is an elected member of the National Academy of Medicine, a master of the American College of Physicians, and fellow of the American College of Medical Informatics, the Royal College of Physicians–London, and the International Academy of Health Sciences Informatics. He has received the highest career achievement awards in three disciplines: the Robert J. Glaser Award from the Society of General Internal Medicine; the Morris F. Collen Award from the American College of Medical Informatics; and the National Award for Career Achievement and Contribution to Clinical and Translational Science from the Association for Clinical and Translational Science.

    "body": "  ## IU Health Revenue Cycle Services Internship a Student Favorite  Many Bachelor of Science students in Health Services Management at IU Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health have had the opportunity to complete the IU Health Revenue Cycle Services internship, and it has not taken long for it to become a student favorite.  Wanting to better understand the billing cycle and challenges within nonclinical services, BS in Health Services Management student, Mackenzie Farmer was excited about the internship.  “I had the opportunity to train as a customer service representative,” Mackenzie said. “Taking calls from patients regarding their billing questions and concerns allowed me to gain an understanding of how patients feel and the challenges that they face.”  Mackenzie had the opportunity to work on process improvement projects that included updating the quality scorecards and IU Health patient billing statement, as well as work directly with various levels of leadership.  Not only did she find the responsibilities helpful, but also the people. “Everyone was willing to assist in the projects that I worked on and gave great advice about being a leader in healthcare,” Mackenzie said. “Personally, the internship taught me that I am in the right field of study.”    Another BS in Health Services Management student, Brittany Dixon, was eager to complete the IU Health Revenue Cycle Services internship with the hopes of gaining real-world experience.  “I wanted to learn more about the elements of a revenue cycle, and to work for a prestigious organization like IU Health,” Brittany said.  She participated in a project to identify gaps in the IUH billing statement, researched competitors’ billing statements, and created drafts to implement her research findings.  “I also participated in projects to increase employee engagement within the customer service department and to provide continuous learning opportunities to their employees,” Brittany said.  Confidence and autonomy are just a few of the skills Brittany said she developed throughout her internship. “One major takeaway I had from this internship was being able to see all of the moving parts that work together to provide great care to patients,” she said. “[It] helped me to understand and appreciate the time, effort, and resources that it takes to make things happen in a healthcare organization.”  Through the IU Health Revenue Cycle Services internship, Brittany said she was able to see in real time what she was learning in class, making the terms and concepts truly come to life. Much like with Mackenzie, the lessons Brittany learned were just as influential as the people she worked with.  “I was able to learn from and work with some phenomenal people at IU Health,” Brittany said. “My director really cared about me and made sure that I was always learning and growing. I am so appreciative of the opportunity IU Health provided me and highly recommend students take full advantage of it.” "

    "body": "  ## State health officials tell their stories  What qualities contribute to effective state health officials (SHOs)? Hear from 11 participants in the State Health Officials Career Achievement and Sustainability Evaluation (SHO-CASE) Study who explain their individual experiences as health leaders.   ### Nicole Alexander-Scott, MD, MPH  Rhode Island, 2015-current As the current director of the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH), Nicole Alexander-Scott, MD, MPH, has emerged as a leading voice in Rhode Island and nationally in ensuring that every person has an equal opportunity to be as healthy as possible, no matter their ZIP code of residence, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, level of education, level of income, or insurance status.  Description of the video:  Hugh:         Well, let's just start at the very beginning. This is about, how can we help state health officers be successful, so what's your definition of success? What's success in public health for a state health officer?    Nicole:       For a state health official, in my view, success means that you're able to bring some of your own skillsets, talents, gifts and abilities to a state public health agency; be able to embed with and add to the expertise that already exists there; and advance that agency to another level prior to leaving. For example, from my perspective, our agency had a real focus on health equity. And my entire career has involved a commitment to eliminating disparities, and achieving health equity, and making sure that there is equitable access to services and care for people. Bringing those together has been a signature goal for me, to be able to make sure that our Health Equity Zones Initiative, that the department had already birthed, that I was able to join with and take to the next level in promoting it at the state level, is successful. We want it to be successful. We want it to be sustained. For me, one of the demonstrations of success will be that by the time I leave the Health Equity Zones Initiative it is not only successful, institutionalized, and well-embedded into our state system with sustainable funding for making the difference that it's intended to, going forward.    Hugh:         Don't misunderstand this long pause as anything except I want to be sure that that gets its own independent time on camera. That was a wonderful answer. Think out loud with us about the ingredients of success. You've named your one great success, one key area of success. What are the components of that? What are the key attributes, your own personal attributes and other aspects that you bring to making that a success?    Nicole:       From the state health official's standpoint, personally, what that person brings to leading to such success as an outcome really revolves around emotional intelligence. It's interesting how prominent that has become during my time here. It's something that I was always aware of and certainly appreciated having some experience with, but really have acknowledged that key element to engaging with partners. Being able to communicate to your governor, to other legislators as well as to fellow colleagues and directors of other state agencies, and to your staff, in a way that promotes and inspires leadership. Emotional intelligence is something that should not be underestimated. Being able to be self-reflective, understand why you're having certain reactions to certain responses or activities that are going on, and being able to follow with and be responsive to what your agency is saying is needed. The ability to value who has been there in your agency, who has been committed to public health, and to build on that with that element of emotional intelligence, for me, is a key strategy in achieving the success that's needed. It's often times more than actual knowledge about public health. That's certainly a key component. Being quadruple board certified, adult [INAUDIBLE 00:04:14], infectious disease, I'm familiar with the knowledge benefit, but it often times comes down to being able to be in tune with the people around you, sensing what needs to be moved forward, how you can be that strategic health officer and really get your agency to be in a better place by the time your tenure is over.    Hugh:         Let me segue to challenges. In addition to this leadership achievement, what is the greatest challenge that you've faced beyond that? Other things, so far, that have got big and taken a lot of your time. What would you name as the biggest challenge?    Nicole:       Number one, by far, is human resources. [Laughs] And being able to understand what management skills are also important to have while focusing on being a leader. Understanding how to delegate, as well. And understanding how to motivate your staff, to incentivize those that are doing good and to hold accountable those that are not, all within variety of political environments that exist. Whether labor relations or a more conservative environment or more liberal, navigating all of that with a human resources system that sometimes has been overlooked over the years, because it's easy to eliminate or not invest in when money gets tight, has been one of the bigger challenges that's required the steepest learning curve, and has often times pushed me in terms of that emotional intelligence and being able to better assess: all right, so what's needed in the situation to navigate this barrier? How do we find the best in people to get the outcomes that we want?    Hugh:         I love the way you laid that out. You've already talked a bit about this, but I'd like you to think out loud a little bit more about leadership lessons you've learned as you've tried to master HR. It takes leadership.    Nicole:       Yes.    Hugh:         What leadership lessons?    Nicole:       Those leadership lessons, for me, connect to what I've mentioned about being in tune with the people around you. Being able to gather the information needed to make a decision expediently, not taking forever to do it but making sure that you have enough information to make a decision. Feeling confident then to be decisive about a decision. And then also have the ability to be humble if there's a need to learn from the good or the not-so-good about that decision and make sure it doesn't happen again. That continuous cycle takes energy, [Laughs] as a leader, to be effective. And there is always that balance of figuring out how to stay attune to what's going on around you from the emotional intelligence standpoint, but then to also not be paralyzed by that and move forward in making a decision. And you just have to go forth in that, be confident in your own experiences and decision making, and then be confident in a team around you that believes in you and can provide feedback and input that will help make the agency successful overall.    Hugh:         If that weren't enough? You had a lot of experience with the state health department before you came to work there as the director, but nonetheless, it's different being the director. Was there something you wish you had known on the first day, that you didn't, that came as a surprise when you become director? What do you wish you had known?    Nicole:       My biggest surprise probably was the amount of legal involvement in your everyday activities. If you would let me, I could have my chief legal in almost every meeting. [Laughs] He might not appreciate that, but there's always an opportunity to sort of view your risks and benefits, that was more than I had understood the case to be. It really highlighted for me the importance of having your strong operations team around you. Making sure that you have people that you are confident in and who are competent and also have a similar heart and vision as you. Your chief legal counsel for sure, your chief financial officer, your communications director, your legislative liaison, and then your number-two person in command, as well, whether they're referred to as a deputy or a chief of staff or COO. That's a core team. And everyone will have a few differences here or there, but making sure that you have not only those people that you are confident in but also the group who you know you can close the door and they can also tell you the truth about a decision that's made, and what the best decision may be, in a way that you can appreciate and trust that in moving forward.    Hugh:         I love truth-telling. I'm so glad you brought that up. In fact, I think you mentioned integrity in your survey and that is so important. If you wanted to actually to use a sentence that used the word \"integrity\", it wouldn't bother me. Just think out loud about integrity and what that means for a state health officer.    Nicole:       Integrity as a state health officer, for me, it's a stabilizer because there are so many moving parts that can occur. So many conversations that you're having in one room, and then going to the other room and having a different angle of that same conversation because of who you're speaking to. Having that element that grounds you in knowing that your heart and intentions are in the right place, to do the right thing to the best of your ability in a way that reflects the integrity that you want to exude, helps kind of rebalance and reground me. I do tend to lean towards that because it can become easy to get swayed in your conversation with the governor's office today, and then with the legislator tomorrow, but with an advocate from the community the day after that. What's the central value and core that is driving you to be able to make the decisions and have the conversations you need to with each of those audience members but in a way that still fulfills the integrity that you always want to maintain?    Hugh:         Breathtaking. Thank you. One of the things we're studying is the high turnover among state health officers. What is the impact of having a state health officer leave?    Nicole:       It's significant.    Hugh:         Would you start that again? Just sort of, what is the impact? Tell me about the impact of a state officer leaving.    Nicole:       The impact of a state officer leaving is significant on an agency. You often times, I often times think of the leaders within the agency at the program level that have been committed for years. And prior to starting and prior to my name even being placed in the hat, so to speak, one of those leaders shared with me, we respect who is in that role but at the end of the day, as well, we are the ones who kind of keep the machine going and are critical to be responsive to the different needs of the community. It's key for a state health officer to recognize that, when they're in their position, number one, so that there can continue to be an investment in those people who have been committed—5, 10, 15 years of doing the right thing—so that they can have the leadership development and career development and support that's needed. But then it's also more stabilizing for the agency to not have the change. Human nature, someone new comes in, there's a need to shift or change something. Sometimes you're changing priorities and directions all together because it's also within a new administration; that's disruptive for an agency if it happens too frequently and can hinder the ability of a public health agency in particular, to positively impact the community the way we all intend to do. Having that time to really advance what's needed, institutionalize some of the core values that are key, add some tools that will lead to sustainable funding over time—those are goals, for me, to be able to establish while in the agency. And if I leave too soon, that kind of just goes astray. Unless the next person comes in with it even better, which is always a good thing too.    Hugh:         You always hope, don't you?    Nicole:       Yes.    Hugh:         You brought up, and I want you to just think out loud with us about it, the relationship between academia and public health. Particularly for a state health officer, how does a state health officer build relationships with schools of public health and medicine in the community?    Nicole:       I can tell you how important I feel the relationship between academia and public health is by sharing that on day one of being a state health officer in Rhode Island I presented to our all-employees staff at our first meeting the creation of the Rhode Island Department of Health Academic Center. And I shared with them that what my vision is for this academic center is to be able to integrate what I had enjoyed doing in the two full-time jobs that I had just before being selected or appointed by the governor into this role. Which was, as a clinical academician, I would see in the academic world new advances, research, latest clinical trials, innovative thought processes with students who were constantly engaged and asking questions. And then I would see in the public health world rich, state-wide-level data connections to the community and seeing the full extent of the needs at that level, and the ability to intervene, for implementation science, so to speak, at the community level. When you can bring those two worlds together, the synergies that result have been monumental. When you see what San Francisco, within the HIV world, for example, has achieved in having the university embedded with the health department there. And that was really the motivator for me.    We're now two and half years in with having the Rhode Island Department of Health Academic Center. We have a focus on promoting workforce and career development for our staff so that they can be engaged in the academic process and really stimulate the research questions that we have. Why are the overdose rates as high as they are in this community? Why isn't this community using SNAP benefits that we have for them? What can we do better about the teen pregnancy rates in this community? And use those questions to lead the partnership with academia, to say, \"Your research career is focused on overdose. Let's partner. Help us in answering these questions.\" And then that can just not only foster innovation but solutions. Together then we can apply for grants and diversify our funding portfolio, which they hear me discuss often. And then bring students through who can get exposed to an entire new world of public health. Not only health students but economists and architects and paralegals and other professional students who can then see what it is to achieve health equity from a public-health perspective.    Hugh:         Let's segue to the future. Public health is an extraordinary field, and you obviously love what you do. What do you think the most exciting, greatest opportunity is ahead for us in public health, particularly in state public health leadership?    Nicole:       The most exciting opportunity I see for state public health leadership is to really take the role of being a convener to the next level. In order for us to really achieve the ability to say, \"Regardless of the zip code you're from, you should have access to living the healthiest life you can live in the healthiest community.\" It's not going to happen just through a narrow public-health lane. It has to happen with our transportation and our policy and education and child welfare and behavioral health partners together understanding that mindset. Often times they are doing that in their respective worlds but need public health to be able to translate and bring together those languages, so that instead of going off in silos, potentially in two different directions, we can align the paths and the directions that we're going in and help leverage the work that needs to get done. It's a deliberate process and it has to happen at the local, state, and federal level. And as state health officials we have the ability to directly impact both, as well as our own level. The number of times that we talk to our federal partners about thinking proactively of how they can align the grants that SAMHSA is giving us for overdose with the grants that CDC is giving us for overdose, so that we can better leverage the work that we all need to do to address the overdose epidemic. And then, at the local level, how can we share best practices among the various communities to help each of them get up to an equal level of achieving the optimal health outcomes that we know are necessary? If state health leadership can continue to really be focused on that ability to bring together the usual partners, as well as the unusual partners, enjoying connecting better with our commerce secretary in our state, those types of connections can really take us to where we need to be to achieve health equity, which is our goal from a public-health perspective.    Hugh:         Great. Last comment. For your last one, think out loud, what do you want to say to the next generation of public health leaders? You have people looking who are students or new state health officers. What do they need to know?    Nicole:       For the next generation of public health leaders my message would be, certainly follow your heart, do what you are passionate about. It's absolutely what has led me to this role. But then also think outside the box. Don't consider yourself to be the only one that's thinking that, or start from scratch, but look around you to see how you can leverage the partners who are there, because being effective within public health, the one thing it requires is for you to not do it by yourself. The ability to know how to engage partners, how to speak the language that they speak so that we can get the outcomes, is what I would encourage future public health leaders to focus on so that we can get some new outcomes and better results for the populations that we serve.    Hugh:         Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott, you quite take my breath away. You started off doing two full-time jobs. You clearly do more than that now. As a passionate leader, I bet you do them all better than anybody else ever has. Thank you so much for doing this with us.    Nicole:       Thank you for having me. It's important. [Laughs]     ### John Auerbach, MBA  Massachusetts, 2007-2012 John Auerbach is president and CEO of the Trust for America’s Health, where he oversees the organization’s work to promote sound public health policy and make disease prevention a national priority. Over the course of a 30-year career, he has held senior public health positions at the federal, state, and local levels.  Description of the video:  Ed:            I'm Dr. Ed Baker. Today I'm interviewing Dr. John Auerbach former health director in Massachusetts for a research project that is being led by the Indiana University Fairbanks School of Public Health. The purpose of our research is to explore and better understand what it means to be a success as a state health official. John, thank you for doing this with me today. I'm looking forward to talking with you.    John:        My pleasure.    Ed:            John, thank you again for doing this conversation with me. Let's start out with success as a state health official. As you look back on your time there, what does success look like to you as you reflect back on your tenure as a state health director?    John:        I think that the biggest indicator of success is being able to point to some sign, some concrete sign that health actually improved as a result of actions that I took, or I took in partnership with other people at the department. Ideally, that's improved health and some indication that people were healthier as a result of our policies or our programs. It may be other surrogate markers that are suggestive of success, but I think that would be the gold standard. I'd settle for a silver standard that had to do with improving awareness, knowledge, perhaps attitudes in some measurable way, that were more supportive of public health or of activities that would promote health.    Ed:            When you think about that, as you've just described it, what factors in your mind contributed to that success? Not only perhaps your individual activities but activities of others. What were the factors that really contributed to your success?    John:        There were a number of factors that contributed to my success in that role. The first I would say is good fortune to work for governors and a secretary who supported public health. I have to also say a state legislature. You can do so much more when you're in an environment where you receive funding for your work and where new and innovative ideas are received openly; if not always accepted, there's an open process for making the case. I don't kid myself. If we had success while I was there, a lot of it had to do with the good fortune of being in the right political environment.    That said, I think another factor was that I had already worked in public health for a long time by the time I was appointed to be a state health commissioner. I'd worked at the state health department for a decade. I was the chief of staff, I was an assistant commissioner, and then I'd left the state health department and worked for almost a decade as a local health officer where I had to address any health issue that arose in the largest city in the state. When I came back to the department as the state health commissioner, I knew the issues, I knew the challenges, I knew many of the key people I was going to need to work with—that was very important. Third, I was very fortunate that I could bring with me a team of people I'd worked with already or that I knew had the skills and experiences that we needed in order to have a successful tenure.    Ed:            Wow. You really had a lot of things lining up to help you succeed.    John:        I was very fortunate.    Ed:            What about, John, challenges? You've mentioned to me a major challenge that you faced during your term as state health director. What would be an example of the most, really, greatest challenges for you during your tenure? And how did you address that?    John:        The biggest challenge during my tenure as state health commissioner was a result of the fact that I was appointed right before the recession hit in 2008. That meant that year after year, the entire time I was state health commissioner, we were cutting the budget. In fact, we had eight rounds of layoffs. Eight. And each round of layoffs took months. Almost every single month that I was a state health commissioner, I was in the process of scaling back programs and laying people off. That took a lot of energy, distracted us from the work we wanted to be doing to promote good health. It created problems within the department around the overall morale, so we had to pay a lot of attention to building morale. And it also meant that people needed certain kinds of creative skills to be able to deal with those challenges and still keep their eye on the ball about what were the key public health issues we need to focus on. I would say overall the team of people did an outstanding job, but it wasn't easy.    Ed:            Wow. That's a huge challenge. You mentioned coming into the job as state health director with a familiarity with the state health department, and also having been the health director in Boston, you were familiar with the territory, so to speak.    John:        Yes.    Ed:            What do you wish you had known before becoming state health director, that when you got into the job you realized, \"Gee, I wish I'd known about this or that\"? Was there anything in particular that you said, \"Gee, I wish I'd known about this before I became state health director in Massachusetts\"?    John:        I had been government for a long time, so you would think that I already knew what I needed to know. I would say, though, one thing I wish I'd known, and known in a very deep way, not just known in my head, was that I needed not to take seriously either the good or the negative things people said about me. I think that you have to have a thick skin to do these jobs because you do take heat. You also get a lot of praise when things go well. I think going into these jobs recognizing you're there temporarily. If things go well, people say nice things about you. If they don't go well, they say not-so-nice things about you. It's not personal. It's really about, more than anything it's about being in government just comes at a certain price. I would say that was one of the things that I wish I knew.    I also was coming back to the state government after having worked as a city health commissioner in Boston for almost a decade. When I was a city health commissioner there was one person I needed to pay attention to if I wanted to change a policy or support a program. That was the mayor. As long as I had a good working relationship with the mayor, things clicked. Coming back into the state I was struck by just how many layers I had to work through to accomplish anything. It didn't matter if the secretary, or in many cases the governor, also supported what we needed or wanted in our budget or for policy. We had to work with committees in the legislature. We had to work with so many different interest groups. It was a long, slow, complicated process to get anything done. I think I would have appreciated being reminded of that early on, to be patient, to get used to working through all of those different layers, not to assume that if you get through a few of them, you're home free. You really have to have a strategic perspective about, what does it take to get something done that recognizes its complexity?    Ed:            It's a long-term view. It's really having that.    John:        It's a long-term view, definitely.    Ed:            When you left the position, you were there for a number of years, you transitioned out. We're going to talk in a minute about things you're doing now. Transitions affect organizations differently. The question, really, here has to do with the impact of your departure on the state health department. You were there for a while. You'd been, as you said, in the state health department earlier. What do you perceive was the impact of your leaving on the department itself?    John:        Fortunately, I don't think my departure had a significant impact. Let me say that again. Fortunately, I don't think my departure had a significant impact either negatively or, frankly, positively. I was there quite a long time. I was able to bring in a new cohort of leaders that played critical roles in terms of the department, and most of them stayed. The policies and programs that we had put in place when I was commissioner largely stayed in place. The person who took my job after I left was someone I brought into the department and had a very close working relationship with. I would say in general for the department it was a smooth transition.    Ed:            You've really answered, I think, my next question, which was how to mitigate any negative effects of transitions. As you know, sometimes in the role as state health director these transitions can be very abrupt, unanticipated. Say a little bit more about what you believe was in place, or maybe that you did, to mitigate the negative effects of transitions, because sometimes those can be, as you know, problematical. Say a little bit more about that, John, if you would.    John:        My management approach when I was the state health commissioner was to work as a member of a team and to have a lot of shared responsibilities with the other senior members of the team. I believe that made for a smoother transition when I left. There was no one needed to learn something that they didn't already know. They knew what the issues were. They knew what the relationships were like. They were ready to step into those roles. I would encourage other commissioners to think about developing relationships with others in the department so that they are prepared and comfortable about stepping into the role of commissioner during a transition. I think a part of our role is to be a good mentor and to think about the long-term health of the department, and that really means putting together the team of people who will continue running the department and may be stepping into one's shoes.    Ed:            Let's come back, if we could, to something you mentioned earlier, because many state health directors come into a job without understanding, for example, how to work with the governor's office. You mentioned having it take a long time and sometimes there are a lot of different players and actors. Help us understand better what you might call some best practices. You worked hard to develop those relationships with the governors that you served under, with their chiefs of staff, with those people. In just the governor's office now, what could you suggest worked for you, perhaps? What could you suggest might be helpful to other people that want to strengthen their relationship with the governor's office in this job that you had?    John:        Over the course of my tenure, both before being the state health commissioner and after, I worked with four governors—two of them Democrat, two of them Republican. They were quite different leaders. One thing I learned was you need to understand who's sitting in that office and what their priorities are what their work style is, and you need to accommodate that. I do appreciate that the governor is the one in charge, and our role needs to be assisting the governor in making the right decisions, being flexible. That is an important part of the job. I've worked for governors, for example, some of whom were micromanagers and others of whom who were libertarian: they felt like they didn't want to get into details, they wanted you to figure things out, they just wanted there to be no negative stories. It was important to adapt accordingly. That was very important.    I'd say another lesson I learned was patience with transition. We went through many different newly-hired people in the governor's office. Not the governors but their staff. It seemed to us every six months there was some new, really young, inexperienced person who would be hired in the governor's office, whoever the governor was, that would call us up with a bunch of ideas and misunderstandings about what we did. When that's happened several times you begin to feel like, do I have to explain this all over again to another new person who's just entered government? What I've learned was you do. You need to be really patient and you need to take that relationship quite seriously and not express any frustration but be well-prepared to do a thorough briefing and accommodate the needs of the governor's staff.    Ed:            One other thing you mentioned different from the governor's staff and the governor's office is working with the legislature. That's a whole different world. Say a little bit about your experiences there, because, again, some state health officials have never worked with people who are in elected positions in state government. What was that like? That's different.    John:        I enjoyed working with the state legislature. The starting point, though, I would say was that when I worked for different governors they had different approaches to what a department head should be doing in terms of relations with the legislature. Some of the governors encouraged me to reach out to individual legislators and develop relationships and talk about my programs. I worked for a couple of governors who wanted legislative relations to be handled exclusively by the governor's office. So, it was different under different circumstances. I enjoyed working with the legislators. I enjoyed getting to know their staff. Their staff were often the key people that we needed to get to know. We paid a lot of attention to being responsive. If we got a call from a legislator, if they wanted an answer, once we got clearance from the governor's office, we tried to be incredibly helpful to them. We tried to answer quickly and accurately. We followed up with them. We wanted them to believe that we understood that we, in some sense, worked for them and that we were well-trained, smart, and responsible.    Ed:            Another key relationship, as you just said. Now, you've moved on. You've transitioned out of that position. You were at CDC for a while and now you've moved into another position. One of the things that you're involved in now, it seems to me, is around this area of thought leadership. You are leading an organization, and you've published and now begun to speak about this concept of the chief health strategist, in other words, someone in a position like the one we've been talking about, serving as a chief health strategist in this new era that people are describing as Public Health 3.0. You've written about this.    John:        Yes.    Ed:            Could you explain a little bit of what is meant by the term \"chief health strategist\"? If someone were fulfilling that responsibility, what would they do?    John:        Sure. The notion of chief health strategist is developed as a result of the need to think about the future. When you're in the role of a state health commissioner many people consider it like drinking from a fire hose. You're essentially dealing with the emergencies of the day, the most urgent matters. You don't have as much of a chance as you might like to think about, where do I need to be in 5 years or 10 years? What's happening in the state over time in terms of some major trends? You can try to do that but it's not easy. The notion of a chief health strategist was a reflection of taking some time to consider those larger trends nationally, and they're reflected in most states. They represent the changes that have taken place with regard to insurance coverage, how health services are paid for. They recognize the changing demographics, the changing environment with a regard to data, and the shrinking of health resources in the public health sector.    So, the vision of a chief health strategist is one that moves away from the historic role of public health as being a safety-net provider, providing really important clinical services, and in general moves more in the direction of being policy-oriented. It moves away from a focus on working with other people in public health or funded organizations that do the bidding of public health towards a partnership relationship with other sectors: the healthcare sector, transportation, education, and such. It creates a role of being a facilitator and a convener that can provide critical information, like data about the health of the population within the municipality, and like the evidence base for effective policy and programmatic activities. But it has an understanding that there are many other people at the table that are going to have their own interests and will be playing a role in terms of creating a healthier environment for the overall community. And public health can have an important role there but it's really a partnership role.    Ed:            One thing you mentioned is the need for better information and better data. If someone moves in this direction of being a chief health strategist, there needs to be, I would presume, an infrastructure, information systems, information technology—all those things are trends that are moving rapidly, as you know. What about that aspect of, sort of, the public health of the future is important for people to think about in this age where information is sort of central to this strategic role? What would you say there for state health departments?    John:        A state public health department of the future needs to have a different approach to data than we've had in the past, for a number of different reasons. The data that we have historically used is often old, it's often a year or two outdated, sometimes even older than that. It's often at a state level or a county level, not a granular level. Hard sometimes to get subpopulation analysis. And it doesn't include important data sources from other sectors. From housing or from economic information or education information. What we're encouraging people to do as they're thinking about the future is to utilize the best of traditional public health and try as much as possible to have those sources become more timely. We know death data, for instance, is much more timely than it used to be. At the same time, to access new data sources, access data sources from healthcare as a result of electronic medical records, and some possibilities of working with insurers. Working with other sectors that exist that have an impact on health, be they education or economic sectors or ones that are related to transportation or housing. Polling that data to get a fuller picture of what the conditions are in the community that help to shape overall health.    In addition to that, I think we need to be connected to the organizations that work in social media and are involved in our browsers. We need to think creatively about how to tap information that is related to the questions people ask on Google or information that they are putting out to the public on Facebook. There's more and more examples where creatively thinking about that kind of data can also be helpful for a state public health commissioner.    Ed:            It's an exciting future. It's an exciting future. My last question, which you've touched on, is advice to those that would serve as a state health director. Final question. What advice would you give to someone that aspires to do the job that you've done as a state health director?    John:        I would recommend a few things. One thing I would recommend is recognizing you hold the position for a short period of time, and that you have the potential to make a difference. Pick a few priorities, work on those, and enjoy yourself. The second thing I'd say is have a support system. That can be your family, your friends, it can be your peers through ASTHO, but you need a support system. You need people who are there to help you think things through, to remind you you're a good human being on a really bad day, and also to keep you humble and remind you that if your people are standing up and applauding you, it's really more about the position than you. You need a reality check from people who love you and care about you. Finally, I would say it's good to think about the future. Too many state health officials begin to think about \"what next\" at the point they're no longer a state health official. It's not easy to think about the future when you're in the midst of such an important role, but it's worthwhile doing that. Again, I think ask ASTHO and former state health officials who've made that transition can be very helpful in terms of helping think about what their transition was like, what the other career possibilities might be. You want to make sure that you're not caught by surprise and find yourself in a difficult situation at the end of your tenure.    Ed:            John, great advice. Great talking with you today. Thanks so much for taking time to talk.    John:        Thank you. My pleasure.     ### Georges Benjamin, MD  Maryland, 1999-2002 Washington D.C., 1990-1991 (interim) Georges Benjamin is one of the nation’s most influential physician leaders. As a testament to his influence, in 2016, President Obama appointed Dr. Benjamin to the National Infrastructure Advisory Council, a council that advises the president on how best to assure the security of the nation’s critical infrastructure. His career contributions speak to the health issues having the most impact on our nation today.  Description of the video:  Baker:              I'm Ed Baker, and today I'm talking with Dr. Georges Benjamin on the subject of success as a state health official. He served as a state health director in Maryland. This work today is part of a research project out of Indiana University's Fairbanks School of Public Health led by Dr. Paul Halverson asking questions about what it means to be a successful state health official. Georges, thanks so much for talking with me today.    Benjamin:        Ed, I'm glad to be here.    Baker:              Georges, thank you for talking with me today. Let's start off with a very fundamental question. You served as a state health official in Maryland. What does success look like to you when you reflect back on your term as the director of the state health department in Maryland?    Benjamin:        Well, my goals when I was coming in as a state health official—I had come in as being the Deputy, and I moved to being Secretary—I absolutely wanted to make sure that I had ultimately improved the health of the people in Maryland. That was my ultimate goal. We were really excited, because we actually think we achieved it while I was there.    Baker:              What factors do you think that led to your success, the underlying contributing factors, either things that you yourself was responsible for or maybe others, what were those critical success factors that led to those things happening?    Benjamin:        I've always said that it's very difficult to go to a state health job if you don't know the politics and the community. Having spent the four years, almost, as Deputy, I had learned the ropes. Of course, I had an amazing boss, Marty Wasserman, who I really learned a lot from. I think the real critical aspects of what we accomplished as a team was one focus. We decided we were going to do a few things very well and deal with the crises as they came along. During my time as Deputy, I really built a really amazing team. I brought that team with me, and then we incorporated the other part of the department as part of that team. It was building the star track team that you bring with you from ship to ship. That was really our success.    Baker:              It really mattered to you to understand the department.Getting in there as the Deputy, you had a basic level of understanding, but it sounds like team building was really crucial to your success. Is that what you're saying?    Benjamin:        Team building was absolutely crucial to our success in Maryland. We did a lot of retreats; we did a lot of strategic thinking about where we wanted to go, and we brought consensus around what we thought were the most important priorities for the department to accomplish, understanding the governor's priorities, the challenges we thought we had in state, and functionally what we thought we could reasonably accomplish, realizing that these are ten jobs and we had four years.    Baker:              You mentioned challenges just now. As you look back, there must have been a very significant, maybe even the most important, challenge that you faced in your time as a state health director. Tell us a little bit about what you think maybe your most important challenge was.    Benjamin:        I woke up one morning and discovered that we had really a huge deficit in our Medicaid program, primarily for the mental health side of our program. That was our biggest challenge when I was the state health officer. The real problem with that, of course, was that that had been my program which I had oversight for as the Deputy. The problems that I discovered as Secretary were ones, in many ways, that I created as Deputy. They were political problems, because there was a growing need for mental health services; it was a physical problem, because we had had… We had been blessed almost with six years of really good funding. That's when the economy was churning along. Now the economy was downturning. There was physical pressures, new problems with the Medicaid program primarily on mental health.    Baker:              That was a big hit in terms of budget deficits and a big challenge that you faced, in part because of things that happened even before you took the job.    Benjamin:        There were challenges, and, of course, like I said, part of that was due to my creating some of the problems. One of the real issues was we had gone to mandatory managed care in Maryland. That was going quite well overall. In fact, that was one of our successes. We carved out the mental health system, and we thought we had done it right. We brought in a consultant. We brought in a private sector person to help us bill. We suddenly discovered that all of these community-based providers really weren't very good at billing and collecting. We all of a sudden found ourselves with bills that suddenly came in as they improved their collection capacity, and we had not budgeted the money to cover them.    Baker:              What about this issue which comes up from time to time, that when state health officials enter a position, there's something that they really wish they'd known about before taking the job? In your case, you were a Deputy. You'd come up through the system. You knew the department. You knew the people. Once you became the state health official and once you had that particular position, did you stop and say,\"Gee, I wish I had known about this,\" or \"I wish I had known about that,\" maybe in greater depth or whatever before you took this position?    Benjamin:        I understood health care financing reasonably well, but I suddenly discovered that I did not know it well enough. Of course, as Deputy, we had ran 80% of the department with 20% of the money. The rest of the money was all in the Medicaid program, and Medicaid was part of the department. I had a rudimentary understanding of the Medicaid program. I probably should have boned up a lot more on the health care financing side, particularly because we were dealing pretty much with the private sector. That was a very steep learning curve. I was okay. I got through it mostly because I hired the right person as my Medicaid deputy who absolutely understood this thing. I didn't get in her way as she tried to run the program. I just stepped back and was able to steer it. I wish I had learned as much…I knew as much at the end of my term as I needed to know at the beginning.    Baker:              Now, you transitioned out of this position. We're going to talk a little bit in a minute about your life after being a state health official. What about the impact of your departure? In some cases, you know state health officials leave on short notice; others, it's a bit more of a planned experience. Say a little bit, if you could, about the impact of your departure on the department itself. How did that play out? What do you see as the impact of your moving on?    Benjamin:        The impact of my moving out of this particular position was certainly quite different than my impact on leaving the DC health department when I left the DC health department. I left the DC health department in the classic abrupt mayor wants to make a change. Quite frankly, I went through the traditional grief and loss experience. In Maryland, I personally planned my transition and such recognizing that it was a temp job.Understand, this is an enormous loss of control and influence that you lose when you leave these jobs. I personally went through a planning process to think about that so that I wouldn't go through the really terrible time I did when I left the DC health department. Now, even though this was something much more on my terms, it was still a great loss.    Second thing was I began to prepare my staff for my departure. Inappropriately, it got leaked out early that I was leaving through the press. I spent a lot of time talking to people and talking to them about the accomplishments that we had. Frankly, we ended up having a celebration at the end of it and thinking about the transition. At the end of that, of course, we didn't know at the time, but we changed governors, and we changed parties. There was every likelihood that I was going to be leaving anyway, but the fact that we had thought about our successes, we got them, and we catalogued all our successes, we jointly celebrated it made a big difference when I left.    Baker:              Now, you transitioned out of that job into your current position at the American Public Health Association where you're executive director. How did that experience as a state health official prepare you or in some way help support you, in whatever ways, in your current position? How did that play out for you given what you're now doing?    Benjamin:        Well, they're two quite different jobs. Certainly, going to the American Public Health Association was a very big difference in budget. I went from managing almost a $5 billion budget to about $12 million. Frankly, APHA, although very complex. So, running the state health department which was a complex entity, going to a membership association which in itself was a complex entity, that helped me with the complexity. Trying to resolve budget issues in a $12 million budget wasn't a big deal for me. What I learned from making that transition was I moved from being the person that was advocated against to the person doing the advocacy. That's been a big transition for me.    Baker:              You're on the other side a little bit.    Benjamin:        Making the transition from state health official to community advocate and, frankly, running the largest advocacy association for public health in the world was a big switch.    Baker:              Let's talk about the future of public health when you think about this a lot. There's now this talk about Public Health 3.0 and the role of something called a chief health strategist,seeing the role of, say, a state health director in a little bit of a different lens. What are your thoughts about where the field is going? Things are changing. There's a lot of change happening in health care delivery, a lot of change in information systems that are needed to support the work. What about the future? How would you describe what you see as the key things for people to focus on now going ahead?    Benjamin:        I've always believed that the future of public health is for the health officials to view themselves clearly as their community's chief health strategist. If you're at a federal level, your role is at the national level. If you're local or state, it's at that level. If it hurts people or kills people, it's yours. That means that you may not own it, but it's a matrix management situation where you need to manage up, and down, and sideways, and across sectors. The challenge we have in public health is that we haven't all adopted that mindset. Secondly, we've not built our systems to be able to do that. We historically do what we're funded to do and not necessarily do what we ought to do to achieve a goal whether we have the program or not.    Baker:              When you say systems, do you mean things like information systems that really cut across programs, that really support much different kinds of activities? Would that be an example of the kind of systems that are needed?    Benjamin:        The systems that I think we need to build an effective public health system is the legal framework, well-trained people properly positioned to do the job, and all of the tools, whether it's electronic surveillance systems, or data registries, or technical knowledge of working with the hospital system, the private sector, and, frankly, a growing understanding of business and how to engage the private business community using the language that they do. Finally, the people in public health we've talked for years. We always talk about how collaborative we are, and yet, frankly, quite often we are the least collaborative of the people in the world. We need to do a much better job of being a collaborator and an influencer over time with people who, frankly, we disagree with.    Baker:              You've answered, I think, already in part my last question, but I'll reframe it and just hear what your thoughts are. Your advice to future state health officials, people that are becoming state health directors now and doing a job like you did in Maryland, what advice would you give to them based on your own experiences in public health?    Benjamin:        The first thing to remember is these are temp jobs and many things that will come to you that are unanticipated. You need to decide what two or three things that you want to do so that at the end of your tenure, whatever it is, however long or however short it is, that you feel that you've accomplished what you went to do the job for. Recognize that what's going to be layered on top of that is your governor's or your mayor's priorities, depending on where you are, and the stuff that just happens, that the legislature gives you and fate puts in your way. If you focus on the few things you want to do and get your team focused around that, and deal with the mandates that you're given, you'll be quite successful.    Baker:              Right. Georges, thank you so much for talking with us today. I really appreciate it.    Benjamin:        Ed, I was glad I could be here.    Baker:              Great.   ### Leah Devlin, DDS, MPH  North Carolina, 2001-2009 Leah Devlin is a professor of health policy and management at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health. In addition, she is a consultant to the Research Triangle Institute, International (RTI). Dr. Devlin has more than 30 years in public health practice in North Carolina including 10 years as the Wake County health director and 10 years as the state health director for North Carolina.  Description of the video:  Baker:              Hello, I'm Ed Baker and today I'm talking with Dr. Leah Devlin; a colleague and friend, as part of a research project on success for State Health Officials. This project is led by the Indiana University Fairbanks school of public health, Dr. Paul Halverson, a former State Health Official himself is leading our work. We're sponsored by the de Beaumont foundation and work closely with that. So, Leah it's great talking with you again today.    Devlin:             I'm glad to be here with you, Ed.    Baker:              Alright, thank you so much. Let's talk first about your experience as a State Health Official and as you think about it, and look back on it, one of our questions is, \"What does success look like, what in your mind’s eye does success look like when you think back about your term as a State Health Official?\"    Devlin:             Well, Ed, when I look back on my years as a State Health Official and think about what success looks like, I remember that we chose a few priorities, because there are so many issues in public health that need to be addressed, and that we're working on. But, I decided what were the things that I wanted to be able to say, \"During my time, we made a difference on school health; on preparedness, on disparities, and building the public health infrastructure was another priority, and working on Women and Children's issues.\" So, we had those five broad priority areas and how do we move policy? Were we able to put new programs or shore up existing services? What were the partnerships we developed, and did we have impact in the end through those different strategies?    Baker:              So, what I'm hearing you say in terms of success, you said priorities, and then, in a sense you measured your success based on the programs you developed; the policies you put in place and that's the way you could almost determine whether success happened. Is that a fair way of looking at it from your view?    Devlin:             Yeah, I think that's exactly right. You set your priorities. You measure your outcomes and your outcomes can be a range of things. One of the important issues for me was, how visible is public health on an issue? What were our relationships with our partners? Were we creating new partnerships with important players? Or, were we refreshing old partnerships and finding new ways of working together? So, it was how effective are you? How important, do people want to engage with you on these issues? Because, as we know, public health is a team sport and everybody has to be involved. So, it was some of that kind of relationship building, not just whether you decreased teen pregnancy.    Baker:              Let's talk a little bit more about those factors you've just touched on the factors and the sort of way you went about being successful. I watched you in action when I worked in North Carolina, and one of the many things you did well was building those partnerships particularly, across non-traditional lines. Like, with the schools; with the general assembly members, with other people in the State. Say a little bit more about how you went about doing some of those things that led to success, like, building partnerships.    Devlin:             Well, the first thing about building a partnership is getting to know each other ahead of time, before you need each other. So, I always thought about having a cup of coffee with a key leader in the community or, another part of State Government; Agriculture, we were always picking at Agriculture about tobacco or pesticide exposure. Well, when we became leaders in the World of Preparedness after the Anthrax attacks, that was a new way of working with an old partner. The preparedness opportunities also gave us a new way of working with hospitals. One of the things after the Anthrax attacks that the Federal Government did very well, is they dedicated resources and they got it out the door, they gave us broad goals to develop our capacity around acts of bio-terrorism. But, one of the great strategies they did is they sent the money for the hospital preparedness through the State Public Health agency. So, that drove a new way of working with hospitals. So, we had a lot of partnerships already. North Carolina is a partnership State. I think maybe some of that comes from being a Hurricane state. We work together. We know each other. But, it also, the preparedness brought new partnerships to the table. Like, the National Guard; and the Law enforcement and some of these partnerships endure today with some of the other critical issues that we face. So, the relationship building is essential for going forward and making a difference, and living to fight another day. You need your friends in all aspects of our society.    Baker:              Now, you've mentioned to me before that the real challenges around preparedness, you just touched on that being a huge challenge, say a little bit more about if you would, that challenge. What was challenging about it perhaps, and how you really dealt with it? And, you've already touched on it, Leah. But, that was a big challenge for you, because you came into it at a particular point in time. Tell us a little bit about that important challenge for you?    Devlin:             So, I did start as a State Health Director in May of 2001. So, the towers came down in September, and then the anthrax index case, the first man that was sick and died from anthrax was actually...was from Florida, but he got sick in North Carolina. So, we and Florida were the epicenter for that very first investigation of an act of bio-terrorism. And so, right out of the box we were going through hospital records and looking for where the exposure might have been, and whether anybody else might have been exposed. So, it was time of high risk; high concern, and we right away knew we had to ramp up not just the investigation, but communication with the public. Making sure that we were communicating in a timely; complete, and accurate way. Every day; every morning, every afternoon there would be a media either press release, a media availability, a press conference where we had all of our partners together, but that public face of, \"We've got this.\" Because, actually, it was a really great opportunity for us to eliminate actually, who we are in Public Health, what our role is. That for 100 years we've been investigation infectious diseases and detecting early and responding rapidly so that we can contain the damage done when there is an infectious disease in the community. Or, food borne outbreak, for example. So, we were able to demonstrate that there is a local health department in every County in our State. This is what they do. This is what we do. Now, it got a twist because it was intentionally delivered, and that's frightening, and brings new partners for us to work with. But, that we have the experts in the Science; the medicine, the epidemiology, we know the community, this is what we do. And that was a really strong and important message for the community, that really thought the Health Department was that clinic on the corner down the street. We were able to say, \"No, no. That's important. Some of us do that. Some of us don't.\" We do it in North Carolina. But, our community health protection role is foundational and we were able to demonstrate that.    Baker:              It really opened people’s eyes to a whole different aspect of things.    Devlin:             Yes, it did.    Baker:              Now, you knew a lot of about the State Health Department before you became The State Health Director. You worked there, you worked in local public health before that. But, when you took the position, I'm wondering is there something that you wish you would have known about the job or what it consisted of? Or, what you needed to do to be successful? That once you earned the position you said, \"Gee, I wish I knew about this or that.\" Was there anything like that that happened for you?    Devlin:             So, I had already as you say, been in Public Health in North Carolina for over 20 years. I had been a local health director. I had been at the State for a number of years, so, I knew the public health system in my state. I knew the issues, and I knew the people. So, in looking back, I sort of knew what I was getting into. So, looking back on that time what I might have taken great comfort in and been inspired by is that if I had had more awareness of what a gift it was. To have the opportunity to serve as a State Health Officer in a marvelous State. Many challenges, to work with the team that I had to work with, who were fabulous. I worked with a wonderful secretary, Carmen Hooker Odom, and a great Governor. And just, it was an opportunity to grow; to learn, to meet new people. By getting involved in an organization like ASTHO and some of the affiliates I had the opportunity to engage Nationally. And, that was just really life changing. So, I think going into it knowing that there are going to be good days; bad days, knowing that you're going to have successes and that you're going to mess up. But, the big picture in the art of the long view is, \"Wow, not a lot of people get to do this, and how wonderful that was.\" So, it was a gift.    Baker:              Wow, that's great. That's great. Now you had that position for about eight years or so, that's right? And at some point, you transitioned out. You went on to do other things, which we'll talk about in a moment. Say a little bit if you would, Leah, about sort of the impact about your transition and things that you did that sort of effectuate a smooth transition. Things you did to sort of mitigate damage. Sometimes there's a transition that's very abrupt and it's not planned out. But, talk about your transitioning out of the position. What was that like? Particularly, the impact on the organization, and what was done to address that?    Devlin:             Well, I left my role as State Health Director after thirty years of Government service. And, was interested in seeing if there were other opportunities to contribute from a different sector. But, the impact on my leaving the organization was I believe minimal because we had a strong team. They had had opportunities to develop their skills as leaders in the State Level Public Health System and in their own National associations as well. They were visible. You know, you're always torn between having a State Health Director as the face of public health that's communicating; that's branding the message, versus, there’s plenty of sunshine let's let these other really amazing experts talk about their issues in the Public eye so that they're not only developed their skills, but they're visible. People know them. People trust them. The elected and appointed officials are invested in them. So, it is a little bit of a planning process. And then, thinking a little bit about when you leave. I thought it was important to leave when the lights were on. When things were going well. We were in good shape. We weren't in crisis mode. The budget hadn't tanked yet. We hadn't had flu, shortly after all that both of those things happened. So, those are the kinds of things that can help with continuity of your own mission, of your own goals, which are so important and you've invested so much in. The other thing that I think has been a really wonderful opportunity for me, and I'm grateful for it is that I have remained close to my colleagues in the division of Public Health. I'm home grown; I'm in the community, I'm still engaged in Public Health just from the academic sector, and they're very generous in allowing me to continue to be a part of their work. Which, is really fabulous.    Baker:              So, you’ve really maintained those relationship.    Devlin:             Oh, they're very important to me. Very valuable in my life.    Baker:              Let's go back to one relationship issue that I think new State officials need to learn more about. You worked very actively with elected officials in the States general assembly. Obviously, there is a Governor’s office, we'll talk about that in a moment. But, can you say a little more about relationship about with people, elected officials, around the Public Health issues. What did you actually do? How did that go? Maybe, you were telling me a story one time about the State lab, and trying to get, you were all driving off on a trip somewhere and you were working with some of these people. But, that part of working with elected officials is not something that I think people who become State Health Officials know about. Tell us about how that worked or you. What were some of the things you did that seemed to work?    Devlin:             Well, in my work with elected officials, I always was grateful for their service. They stood for election. They made enormous sacrifices to be there with family and with the other careers. So, the fact that they stood for election was impressive to me. In working with them, I was very respectful of them. I was also very, and still am, very respectful of their role. And what my role is. And I was pretty clear in understanding that my role was to bring the Science on an issue. And, based on that Science, what my recommendation as a Scientist would be, State Health Official. But, recognizing that they have a different job. That they have a different set of factors that they are using to make their decisions. Whether it's constituent based; or the economics of a situation, they have other responsibilities. So, I'm there to give them my best guidance based on Science. When you get off on your Science it's just a greasy slide downwards. So, it's really important to stay there on your facts. And, moving into advocacy is tricky. There are others that can do that for you. So, working in partnership with others that are going in another way, another approach to do your advocacy work, usually that's going to be in my State the local health departments were independent. So, they can do that back home in their constituents, in the community or even in the legislature. The non-profit sector is a very good partner in that way as well. The other thing is, I always took someone there with me. So, you always had someone that made sure that everything was, what you heard when you leave is what you thought you heard. That you're not getting pushed into a deal. You never want to make a deal with a legislature. So, that third person, someone from your team, helps everybody stay on the path you meant to stay on when you went in there. So, it's little tricks like that.    Baker:              So, an extra pair of ears there. There's someone else in the room with you that's listening at the same time.    Devlin:             Yeah, ensuring you up. And, it's not just about you. It's your team. Your system. I mean, you may take a local health director... When we worked on tobacco issues, we would go in, when we were working on particularly the smoke free bars and restaurants. Our most important partner, when we would go in and see legislatures, was the head of the restaurant association. And, it was interesting because the legislatures, we had been working on tobacco for 30 years or more. They knew what I was going to say and want I thought. But, they in that office wanted to hear what that business guy had to say who was the leader of the restaurants. So, we were there and we were there together, which was really important. We had a piece of legislation about where a legislature was really wanting to reintroduce unpasteurized milk to the food supply. So, you go in with your agricultural commissioner, and that's very powerful too. So, you're careful about not only taking someone, but who you take is important, also.    Baker:              Yeah, picking the right person, right. You've been doing a lot of interesting things since you left your position. You're at the public health school there at Chapel Hill. You're on the board of the Robert Wood Johnson foundation, and working with RTI. You've done a number of other things. you've stayed in touch with your colleagues as you mentioned. Say a little bit about how your experience as a State health official really informed you, or informed your work, your perspectives, after you left the job. How has that affected what you've done subsequently?    Devlin:             So, I do have a wonderful opportunity to be on the faculty at the University of North Carolina, Gilling’s school of Global Public Health and my role there is to connect the school, which is already very practice focused, as a real commitment of Dean Barbara Ramer. And my job is to increase their connectivity to the community in the State particularly, it's a state agency. So, in the state. And, help our school be a part of solving some of these, what we call the Wicked complex public health issues of our time to be more of a player. The second part of my job is to increase the visibility of the school as a state agency with statewide leaders for what we are doing that makes a difference in our state. That we're not just about research, we're not just about teaching. Both very important, but we are very engaged in service in North Carolina. So, in some ways, the work is the same. It's about building partnerships; developing relationships, connecting dots, being able to step back and see possibilities with really smart faculty and students. Really tough problems and restraints that State government might have. That's particularly true when you work with a partner like RTI which is a private think tank that does a lot of research on a lot of public health issues. They can be more nimble than either of our state agencies, so that's a great partnership. So, in terms of working with the Robert Wood Johnson foundation, which is an amazing institution. The work that they're doing their mission around a culture of health, fits with what I've been about my whole life which is community level engagement. Helping and empowering communities to be engaged in solving their own problems, coalition building, getting everyone to the table. So, that's really central to my life’s work and it's amazing and fabulous to have such an incredible foundation such as the Robert Wood Johnson foundation really making a long-term commitment and focus to that work.    Baker:              When you look at sort of the future public health, you've already talked about this, Leah. Looking ahead, state health officials, as you were, would need to have a vision of where public health is headed. Where it needs to go in this next period of time. What are your thoughts there? Based on how you're seeing the public health landscape about the future? And what particularly new health officals might want to focus on.    Devlin:             I think it's really important in thinking about the public health system and the future, where we might need to be and how a state health director can help position the organization is, making yourself relevant in the community. What’s going on in the community that's important? Of course, at the State level, it would be the whole state. One of the issues for example, is the big disparities between rural and urban areas and how can we work with our hundreds of public health departments or health departments that cover all 100 counties to truly shore up the capacity there; to bring people together, even the most rural communities have assets. They have schools, they have faith communities, some businesses, elected officials. So, how can you continue to make yourself relevant as a leader all on the issues that are important in that community. Some of it is our time on our work. If you're working on prevention, you're going to be working on preconceptual health and family planning; making sure babies are born into the world healthy and wanted and ready to thrive, develop their brains.  We know so much more about brain development and focusing on 0-3. So, it's important for us to stay abreast of the science that's changing and stay focused on the science. It's also important to look for the tables that we need to be at when we're talking about whether it's health care; or environmental issues or chronic disease, leading causes of death and all the behavioral changes that go there. Probably understanding more and more about the science about how you actually motivate behavior change would be huge, right? Because, we know where lots of health comes from is our own choices. The technology age that's out there, I think trying to stay fresh on just not only the technology advancements around communications and social media; how we do communicate with the public. But, also, the new technologies around precision medicine; genomics, the possibility of tailoring prevention messages and preventative behaviors truly to an individual in a broad population approach. Using our phones. Using social media and things like that. I think we need to build on the lessons we've learned. Like preparedness, we've talked about the need for good communications and new partnerships like with Law Enforcement that we've developed. We have an amazing opportunity now to bring those skills to bear on the crisis of our time, the opioid epidemic. That's just one example. It's got the awareness of our elected officials; there's funding there, it's an enormous problem. Everybody has to be engaged. This is work we know how to do. It can be prevented. It can be treated with training and working closely with our health care providers that are partners that we can refresh those relationships. That's one example of an opportunity that's at hand.  But, there is the broader picture of being at the tables where important decisions are being made about health and healthcare, as well as looking long chronic disease. We have not finished the book of business on tobacco and we need to do that. I'm very concerned about where we're going with Marijuana in this country. Another inhalant in people’s lungs and the cognitive challenges there. And then early childhood development. A major, major opportunity as we learn more and more about brain development and getting kids ready.    Baker:              That’s great. Final question, you're advice to a new State Health Official. I'm sure you've talked to people who are new in the job, or are considering the job. What advice would you give to a person that is a new State Health Official?    Devlin:             Some of the advice that I would give to a new state health official is to first of all remember that it's about the issues in the system, it's not about you. So, you know, do your best and sometimes it's going to work, and sometimes it’s not. This is hard work over the long haul. The second is to be transparent in everything you do. Be ready to read about it in the paper tomorrow, or be able to have a conversation about it with your Mom or your Grand-Mom about it. And let that be one of your guides. Surround yourself with good people and be sure that you’re supporting your leadership to the very best extent that you can. Work on your communication skills and build those partnership in the community, along with the team that you have inside. Because, that is how you're going to be able to go forward.    Baker:              Leah, thank you so much it's been great talking with you today.    Devlin:             Thank you for the opportunity, it's always good to be with you, Ed.    Baker:              Great, thanks so much.   ### Jeffrey Engel, MD  North Carolina, 2009-2012 Dr. Jeffrey Engel, MD has served as the executive director of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CTSE) since September 2012. Prior to joining CSTE, Dr. Engel was the North Carolina State health director, managing the Division of Public Health since 2009. He led the state's response to the H1N1 influenza pandemic and secured $23 million in federal funding for preventive health services.  Description of the video:  Hugh Tilson:     This is Hugh Tillson, for the Indiana University Fairbanks school of Public Health project on public health, state health, officer success. [INAUDIBLE 0:00:10.4] foundation funded projects, supported strongly by Asta[phonetic], and we have the privilege of talking with state health officers, current and the former, about what the ingredients of success are, and what the impact of turnover in the state health offices might be. I’ve already been having great conversation with you, Jeff[phonetic] Ankle[phonetic], former state health officer for the state of North Carolina. So, let’s get going and find out what you define as success. So, Jeff, thank you so much for doing this. Let’s just start off with your definition of success. What’s a… What is a successful state health, officer?    Jeffrey Engel:    Well, I have to look at my environment, which is the state of North Carolina, and, I think, in my state, the Health Director role is, actually, defined in statute, and it has to be a physician licensed in that state. That is, pretty much, it. But, in reality, in my time, I think, the success was a dual role. The Health Director needed to wear the hat of the Surgeon General, that is, the subject matter in the public health science of the state, and the second role, is a leader and manager of a very division, within the department of Health and Human Services, that division being the division of Public Health. So, I think, success was mainly due to wearing those two hats, simultaneously, being that valued, trusted, credible public health scientist, as well as a really good manager leading a very complicated division, and an even more complicated department.    Hugh Tilson:     So, let’s peel that onion back one more layer. What are the components of success for a state health officer? What has to be in place?    Jeffrey Engel:    Well, I think, it’s beginning to peel that onion, if you would, beginning at the division level, the… public health is, mainly, a science practice. We rely on data, whether it be a wick[phonetic] program that we administered for the USDA, or communicable disease control immunizations. You needed really solid data to do your job.So, we relied, whether it was in women’s and children’s health, or in the epidemiology sections on really good staff, you know, good scientists who knew what they were doing, who could get to the Health Director, the data, in a timely fashion. But, also, bring with that data, the stories that needed to be told about the large state. Also, being a home-role[phonetic] state, North Carolina needed excellent communications, and relationships with local health departments, and if you didn’t have that in place, you were gonna fail, because these health departments are autonomous. They reported to their own local health boards. They got very little, in terms of resources, from the state. Most of their funding was from their own tax base, and what we needed to do with them, was provide them technical assistance and quality assurance, and help lead them to make sure that, all those counties and locals were rising at the same level. And, then, finally… So, I’m painting a picture, here, of leading, across the division, down to the local department, and then, finally, up, which is to the department of Health and Human Services. So, Health Director reports to the secretary, or an undersecretary in my case, and you have to lead in that complicated, political environment.    Hugh Tilson:     There were so many opportunities to lead, even into your too-short[phonetic] tenure in North Carolina. Now, choose your favorite, biggest, most dramatic challenge, and just talk about that.    Jeffrey Engel:    Well, I had two challenges. One was my biggest and my favorite, as he said. The other was, perhaps, my downfall. The first challenge was the H1N1 pandemic. And, I don’t mean to brag, but I was the right guy for that. Subject matter expert, infectious disease epidemiologist, I wrote the flu response plan. My team did, when I was state epidemiologist. There was no more ready-state health official in the United States. I would argue that I was for the pandemic. As being a recent state epidemiologist, knowing so much, and what my staff had done to put together this very, very robust plan… It was just finished, too. So, it was not on the shelf that long. We had extra-size[phonetic] components of it. So, I was ready to lead through that. The complicated issues of surveillance, the risk communication needed for the public, and at the same time, understanding the Federal asset that was coming down, which was, of course, the counter-measures, in the form of either the strategic national stockpile, which we did not need to tap, but we had our own state stockpile of anti-flu medication. And then, of course, waiting the vaccine, which was gonna take the problem off the table. That was the easy one. The hard one, was the recession. It hit in 2008. I took office in 2009 in March, and the impact on the state budget hit at the same time. We had a brand-new Governor. We’ll talk, maybe, more about that. But, my first instruction was to put together a plan with a 5, 7, and 10 percent cut in our state line. So, the budget is complicated. Our division was, probably, 70 percent Federally-funded, and 30 percent state, and we had to dissect, and say, ‘Well, of those dollars, what was pure state money?” In other words, there was some state money, if we touched, we would lose the Federal drawdown[phonetic]. Like, our Maternal Child Health Block Ram[phonetic], for example. You couldn’t touch that state[phonetic]. So, you had to look at the state dollars that were 100 percent state-funded. We only had a few programs in that category. So, I was going through that, eliminating jobs, and people lost jobs.    Hugh Tilson:     The leadership challenges, there, were many. Just, take off some of the leadership challenges that taxed you.    Jeffrey Engel:    Well, I said the recession. We put forth our budget proposal to the Governor’s office. Some of it came[phonetic] to reality. But, for your information, there were three large pots of three state dollars. One was in the Children’s Developmental Serv… CDSAs. A lot of them were Federally-funded, but most of those positions[phonetic] were pure state. We had a state-health program, which had regional-state hygienists[phonetic] in the schools, in prevention, and all health. And, the third pot of money was the Office of Minority Health. So, the cuts went forward. Two people lost their job in Minority Health. We eliminated, I believe, ten hygienists. We went after the vacancies, of course. But, a couple of people lost their job. And, at the CDSAs, the Children’s Development Service Agencies, we had… We picked at the vacancies, which is not strategic. But, you do it so you’re not firing people. So, that was the hard part of my job, leading on that horizontal division level. The harder part was leading up, into the Department of Health and Human Services, and reporting to the secretary, and the undersecretary. This undersecretary that I reported to was an awful person. He was mean, he, also, didn’t know what he was doing, and he was insecure about that. And, I didn’t manage that well. I was intimidated by him. And, all my meetings in the department were about our hot-button issues, which were areas of our budget that were losing revenue, not due to any fault of our people. So, our state lab was losing money, and our vinyl[phonetic] records Division was losing money, because they were fee-based, and the fees just weren’t coming in, cause, there was a recession, and, also, the legislature cut the fees to… for people wanting their, you know, birth or death records, whatever they needed. And, they cut it so severely, that it couldn’t cut their own costs. So, that’s all I did, when I went to the department, was talk about our red ink. I was never able to talk about our successes, cause that’s all my… This person wanted to hear about, cause, I guess, that’s all he was responsible for, in the governor’s office.    Hugh Tilson:     Let’s talk about, and I think you just answered the next question, which was, even though you were a senior, seasoned state official, were there some things about the director’s job that you didn’t know, that you wish you’d known, on day one.    Jeffrey Engel:    Yeah, so I think on day one, and I had leadership training later, was that leading-up piece, into the department of Health and Human Services, and beyond that, the Governor’s office. I didn’t work with the Governor much at all. But, I did with her staff. And, I wish I could have just played the politics better. And, it wasn’t partisan politics. It was, just, understanding the stresses that any elected official is under. In 2010, the legislature just completely flipped, from 150 years of democratic party leadership to Republican leadership, for the first time in 100… I don’t know, 140 years, or whatever it was. So, we had to deal, now, with all-new… A whole-new majority, that was opposite of the party of the Governor, dealing with the recession, and the other thing that you need to be a successful leader, is to have that champion in the legislator, which we lost. So, I was hung out to dry. I had an executive office that I couldn’t trust, because of this mean person that I had to report to, even though I could go to the secretary, and engender his trust, a Governor that was failing, and now a legislator that I didn’t know, and had an agenda.    Hugh Tilson:     You know that one of the motivations for this study, is the understanding of turnover. What do you say, publicly, about our turnover?    Jeffrey Engel:    What I say, publicly, is that the Governor chose to appoint a new Health Director, and that was her priveledge that I wasn’t political boy-me[phonetic], and that’s what happened. That’s what I’d tell the public. And, that’s what happened. What I don’t tell the public, of course, is the backstory, which I, really, don’t know, but I explored as deep as I could, because I was incredibly shocked. If we can take a side-moment, and I’ll let you… I’ll share that with you. It was in 2012, secretary called me into his office, and he did that all the time, so I was out of town, and I made arrangements to go see him right away.  I thought it was gonna be something else, because he had announced that he was resigning as secretary, and I thought he was just meeting with his division directors, to tell them personally about his decision, and I thought that’s what I was walking into. So, I came into his office, and he said, “The Governor wants me to remove you from office. She wants to appoint somebody else. I’m sorry.” And, that was it. Talk about being pushed off the cliff. I had a visceral reaction, cause, I wasn’t expecting it. I thought I was doing a really good job. And, I gasped. I looked audibly, like that. I was sitting here, like I am with you, now. That’s how shocked I was. And, he said, he apologized. He told me who my replacement was gonna be, which is another complicated story that’s probably not necessary for this interview. And, I had 90 days. That was typical of, you know, your political appointees, and you will now be a senior advisor in the department of Health and Human Services, and you have 90 days to pack. Good luck. So, you know, I left the office. The first thing I did was call my wife. I was in tears. I had no plan B, which is another lesson learned there we’re gonna get to later in the interview. Always have a plan B if you’re a state health official. And, I can tell you why I didn’t; because, North Carolina, this was, pretty much, a secure job. My predecessor had it for nine years. Her predecessor had it for 17.    Hugh Tilson:     You’re aware of what his predecessor experienced, however.    Jeffrey Engel:    Yes. Let’s… Yes.    Hugh Tilson:     Let’s move on [INAUDIBLE 0:15:31.8] that. One of the things we’re studying, is the adverse impact on the agency of precipitous turnover. What happened to the agency, when you came back and announced that you were leaving?    Jeffrey Engel:    Well, I first met with my senior leaders, who were the section chiefs, and I sat them down, and I, you know, I told them how shocked I was. By then, I had recovered emotionally. I had my act together, and I told them who the new Health Director was, and I was gonna be cleaning my office out that weekend, and that she will be starting on Monday. And, they were shocked. And, they came to me, individually, afterwards, and just told me how sorry they were. But, I think the impact on the division, which is 2,000 employees, was one of great insecurity. And, they were saying, “If this could happen with the sitting Governor, what could happen to me? Even though, I’m not a political appointee.” And then, what happened in North Carolina after I left, is that the State Health Director’s position has been a revolving door. Nobody has served longer than a few months, 12, 15 months, since I left. I was there for three years, so I can proudly say I was the last long-term Health Director in North Carolina. So, what professional would want that job? You know? See, when I took it, I had some sense of job security with the predecessors, as I talked to you about. I figured, “I’d have to really mess up to lose this job. And, I’m not gonna do that.” So, now, what professional, in their right mind, would take this job, in North Carolina? That’s been the long-term damage.    Hugh Tilson:     Is there anything that you could have done, anything that new-state[phonetic] officers can do, to prepare the agency for this instability. What can we do to, at least, create continuity in the agency?    Jeffrey Engel:    Yeah. So, I thin, personally, the State Health Director needs to have that plan B, and say, “I don’t know how long this I gonna last. I hope it lasts the term of the Governor. But, I need to have, what am I g… I don’t know, am I gonna go back to my old job, or I need to prepare for my next step. Some of this may come with very senior leaders. They may say, “Hey, you know, this is gonna be my last real gig anywhere. I’m gonna be retiring, no matter what happens to me.” And, that’s good. But, then that leaves you with a rather limited pool of aging, you know, professionals.    Hugh Tilson:     So, how do we prepare the agency for that? Is there something you can do to build a stable agency in the face of that?    Jeffrey Engel:    But, that’s what I was getting to. That’s the personal piece, is, just planning for your own succession. But, the agency… Thinking about this is… You should always have a succession plan in mind. I mean, you can be hit by a bus the next day. What would the division do? So, I think a senior deputy is mandatory. I did not have that person. I had a chief operating officer. But, he was not the senior deputy, and I think that would have been a second-half, that person. We could have warned. We could have been a succession… Doing succession planning all the time.    Hugh Tilson:     Let’s get cheerful, again. Your subsequent career has been fabulous, of course. One of the good things, is, that you are now a national leader in Epidemiology. Talk about Epidemiology in public health, and specifically, the relationship of state-level epidemiology with national activity. Just, bring us up-to-date on epidemiology.    Jeffrey Engel:    Right. So, it’s been a great jump for me, in Atlanta, leading the field of Applied Public Health Epidemiology, as we like to call it, at the counsel state territorial epidemiologist. So, we have job security, because our science is the core of public health. You could argue that the epidemiologist working with the laboratorians, so the lab is the other core piece, forms the foundation for almost everything else, as decisions and policy go up the ladder. So, we have that core science that will always be there. And, I always like to say, if you look at the ten essential services of public health, what’s number one, monitoring the health of the population. Who does the monitoring? The epidemiologists, and their statisticians, and their labs. So, we’re number one, in the essential public health services.  What’s going on, now, in the whole framework, nationally, is that our folks are contributing, in terms of the public health response to emergencies, and it’s been the EOC, the CDC has been[phonetic] open for the last three… They’re closing next week for Zica[phonetic], but they were open for Ebola, they’ve been open for Zica[phonetic]. Limited activity around the hurricanes, recently. But the epidemiology capacity-building in public-health-preparedness has been a big, front-and-center, national issue. The other thing, is preparing the epidemiology workforce for the twenty-first century, although, we’re already 17 years into that century, some of our methods are still twentieth-century, such as, just data flow, data management, and our… What we’re really focusing on, now, in the field, is computational science. It’s called Informatics, but it’s, really, computer science, and understanding the data, and how to move it more accurately, more quickly, and just be more-timely.    Hugh Tilson:     That segway’s, sort of, end-game of this interview, which is, even more optimist, or maybe not. What do you… What do you see as the greatest opportunities for public health, in the coming years?    Jeffrey Engel:    Well, I think, that, public health, if leveraged correctly, and you could call it public health three-point-oh, where the health direct is, also, sort of, the health negotiator for the community. And, it[phonetic] can happen locally, or at the state level, or, certainly, nationally. Public health is, really, the only activity that’s going to bend the health cost curve of this nation. You can talk about payment reform all you want, fee[phonetic] for performance rather than fee for service, people are still gonna get sick, and they’re still gonna need care. Care is expensive. The only group that’s talking about prevention, in particularly, of the high-cost diseases of morbidity, mortality, in the United States, is public health. So, if we could just get a few things done, whether if be in tobacco, or banning trans-fats, or limiting salts, or increasing physical activity in communities, that’s the only thing that I can think of, that’s gonna, really, impact the cost of health care. The ACA, as good as it was for access, really did nothing about the upstream[phonetic] determinance[phonetic], in a big way. There were a few provisions in there, that were helpful. But, for the most part, it was about access, and it fulfilled that promise. So, the opportunity for public health, going forward, is, really, going to be that leader in public health three-point-oh.    Hugh Tilson:     How about a pep-talk for astho[phonetic]-alumni? What happens after you’ve been a state health officer, do you stop being a state health officer?    Jeffrey Engel:    Well, I tell you what. I always look back in saying, “I loved that job.” And, I think, you will always have it, as that memory. And, it may be the pinnacle of your career. But, we’re all pretty capable people. And, all of us land on our feet. Even the ones, where, it’s the terminal job, that is, they retire after they’re complete. They’re all active active, whether it’s in the alumni society, or they’re doing consulting work, they’re recognized leaders. They’re always the Health Director, or the health official. So, that job instilled that in me, and I was fortunate, I mean, doing this national gig now, at Atlanta, and I love public health. And, I can, really, thank the experience I had as a state health official.    Hugh Tilson:     So, your last chance, here, this is your [INAUDIBLE 0:25:08.8] we found at the camera, to talk about… To talk with future shows, people are thinking about being a show, training up, or new shows… What message do you wanna leave them with?    Jeffrey Engel:    Again, it depends on your state environment. But, be that subject-matter expert, and be that good manager. But, also, learn how to lead up, whoever you’re reporting to. In my case, it was the secretary, and a big-umbrella agency, called Health and Human Services. You may be reporting directly to the Governor, and maybe, sitting on that Cabinet. To me, that was the hardest, was that leading-up. Understand the politics, know that a politics[phonetic] is more emotion than fact. If you’re not getting along with a leader, as you’re leading up, take that person out to lunch. Get to know them better. That was my mistake. If I could do it over again, that’s what I would have done.    Hugh Tilson:     Dear Jeff Ankle[phonetic], one of my state health officers in North Carolina, clearly evidence-based, perfectly qualified, a very model of a modern state health officer, and a great success subsequently. Thank you for this interview, Jeff.    Jeffrey Engel:    Thank you, you[phonetic].   ### Paul K. Halverson, DrPH, FACHE  Arkansas, 2005-2013 Paul Halverson is the founding dean of the Indiana University Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health in Indianapolis. Dr. Halverson came to Indiana University from the Arkansas Department of Health where he served as state health officer and director. Prior to his appointment as state health officer, Dr. Halverson served in senior management roles at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Description of the video:  Hugh Tilson:     Hi.  This is Hugh Tilson.  I’m having an interview and wonderful conversation.  This is no interview is it, Paul?    Dr. Halverson:  No.    Hugh Tilson:     I’m with Dr. Paul Halverson.  He’s the new Dean of the new school.  No longer new after five years, the Fairbanks School of Public Health Indiana University and the principal investigator for this extraordinary de Beaumont funded ASTHO-supported IU-based study on Public Health success.    Dr. Halverson:  Right.    Hugh Tilson:     Thank you so much for joining me in this conversation, Paul.  In addition to all of your other roles, you are a former State Health Officer.    Dr. Halverson:  It has been my honor.  That’s right.    Hugh Tilson:     Right at the core of our study is this concept of success as a State Health Officer.  What is success?    Dr. Halverson:  It’s interesting.  I’ll answer that question by first telling you a bit of a story.  When I first arrived in Arkansas as the State Health Commissioner you may remember it was after the unfortunate and untimely death of Dr. Fay Boozman who was in that role and died in a farm accident.  That, in and of itself you know, was a public health issue.  When I first came to be in that role, I had a chance to go around to all of our 75 counties and 93 offices.  I did that over a year but one of the first trips I made I actually went to a rural part of Arkansas and had a chance to really drive in the neighborhoods in small towns.  Usually that meant going on dirt roads.  Frequently it meant just trying to get a sense of where people live and what their conditions were that they lived in every day.  Inherently, I knew it was different than what I lived at.  What I found was and I’ll never get it out of my mind was children playing in a dirty street and there was just something about it.  As I talked to people in the community I discovered that many of these kids hadn’t had anything to eat and there really were problems in terms of malnutrition and just not having the sense that they will really have a full meal.  Not really having the advantages, I think, that a lot of people.  We would all like to say that our kids can grow up and have a carefree life and these kids didn’t.  It was interesting to me.  It set the stage for what to me is success and that is being able to intervene, to create the conditions under which people really can be healthy.  To me, take it another step forward and say it’s really about giving kids hope, right?  Not just the kids, but their parents.  As we all live together in communities it seems to me that one of the most important things that we could strive for in terms of public health is the success of providing the opportunity for people to have hope that tomorrow will be better than today.  That there is reason to believe that because of public health there is a better tomorrow.  I’m sorry, maybe it sounds corny.  To me, it was a driving force to say, “You know, we can do better than this.”  So that has been on my mind along with a number of other things about how I wanted to change the way that we lived, worked, played and worked together as a community.    Hugh Tilson:     What a fabulous answer.  What are the components of success?  How do you get there?  What are the factors that you need?    Dr. Halverson:  To me, I think it starts with an understanding of public health science.  We talk a lot about how public health over time has eroded in many ways.  We’ve lost capacity and in some cases I would say we’ve never had that capacity.  I think we need to begin our work with the strong foundation, a scientific basis of what we call public health.  I guess perhaps one of the reasons why I’m most interested in education.  Practical, practice-ready education that focuses not just on theory for theory’s sake but theory to help us better understand what the most effective evidence-based strategies could be and that allows us to better understand to be a critical consumer of that information.  Number one, the factor is a strong foundation in public health science.  Number two is an understanding of how communities work and that we collectively need to help engage with communities.  We need to be trusted sources of information.  We need to help communities understand their options and the importance of public health, and why health is at the cornerstone of their economic development and the cultural development of their community.  Having that understanding of community and the leadership that it takes to be able to lead from behind, lead in the front, lead in a way that allows people to believe and to really know that we are partnering together to improve their health.  Third, I think from a practical perspective, the way we move organizations is having a good, solid understanding of management and leadership.  We know that leaders can be taught and my hope is that we in public health will do a much better job of training people to lead well.  There is good information out there, it’s available.  We just need to use that information.  Fourth, the idea here is that we need some zeal, some zip.  We need to have hope ourselves that things can get better and that enthusiasm we have, I hope, will spill over to others.  That zip, the leadership in management experience and knowledge, the public health science and the leadership within the community, and a real sense of authentic community engagement.  I think all four of those things are really important as we think about the factors or the pillars, if you will.    Hugh Tilson:     Let’s apply it.  Remind us where you were a State Health Officer and what years you served.    Dr. Halverson:  I was the state health officer in Arkansas from 2005 to 2013.    Hugh Tilson:     During that time you had a lot of challenges, some real doozies.  Just drill down on one.  What was the biggest challenge, the biggest issue that you faced in that time?    Dr. Halverson:  Boy, that’s a really tough question.  It seemed like every day was a new challenge.  I often said that it was the best job that I ever had.  Some days it was both the best and worst day that I’ve ever had.  So I don’t know.  I suppose that one of the biggest challenges was the challenge of demonstrating to the Governor and to the legislature the importance of public health as its own agency.  You may know that when I came as the State Health Officer it was in the waning days of the Arkansas Department of Health and the organization was slated for consolidation to become part of the Department of Health & Human Services.  There was this one guy that was the director of what was now the Department of Health & Human Services, John Selig, a terrific guy, a wonderful career person.  Had primarily focused on children, Medicaid and it was a huge agency.  What happened was that public health became one of 13 divisions within the new Health & Human Services area.  Despite all of our great intentions when the Governor says I need to have the top three issues for your agency and if your agency contained health and other things, sometimes it was competition to decide whether you would even get one thing that would be mentioned as a health issue.  The idea was to save money by consolidating our Health Department with Human Services and so why wouldn’t we do that.  Part of it was I don’t think people really understood the importance of health.  So it was a good intention, great people that were trying to make it work, but over a relatively short period of time the legislature and our new Governor decided it was time to reverse course.  Health was too important to simply be buried in an umbrella agency that didn’t have as its primary purpose protecting and improving the health of the public.  I remember when the Governor, I talked with him and he said, “It’s too important.  You need to have a strong voice in supporting public health.  I need to hear directly from you.  It needn’t be filtered.  It’s important enough that in our state health is prominent as its own agency.”  That was a challenge not just to me but to public health overall.  We were able to convince the Governor and the legislature in a way that was professional and respectful, but the importance of being our own agency.  That set the stage then for a number of things that I’m quite proud of, including the passage of the tobacco tax increase which also at the same time occurred with the passage of legislation that substantially created the trauma system for our state.  We were, I think, among the last states in the country to have an organized trauma system.  A trauma system that included not just the big city of Little Rock, but all of our state.  I can’t help but believe that’s one of the most lasting things that occurred was the creation and the number of lives saved by essentially employing what we know about injury prevention and control.  A lot of things went on that I’m quite proud of.  A lot of work went on by some very talented people.  It was my privilege to have worked with and creating an important team.  Groups of teams that worked on a lot of different projects.  There were a number of challenges but that’s just one.    Hugh Tilson:     What I want to hear is what leadership skills it takes for a State Health Officer to lead that kind of change.    Dr. Halverson:  I think leadership is important in introducing and sustaining change.  I think it’s a different kind of leadership if you think about it.  It’s not what you’re selling, it’s what you’re actually able to get people to not just be attracted to the idea but to actually embrace the change as something that is theirs, and they can see the purpose and the benefit to them, to their organization, to their jurisdiction.  Whatever the unit might be.  I think in the case of public health particularly as we think about State Public Health and large initiatives, take for example tobacco addiction.  We know it’s the leading cause of death in all states.  Still today, while we have literally millions of people dying of tobacco-related diseases and we know how to deal with it, but we’re not.  I would say to you that I think public health’s greatest failing in terms of our leadership is in our inability to take what is incontrovertible evidence, particularly related to tobacco and just employ evidence-based solutions that we know work.  We know how to deal with tobacco addiction.  Our challenge in public health is convincing others the importance of making a change, creating a political change that will ultimately lead to improved policies that have the greatest likelihood of reducing addiction to tobacco and ultimately improving the health of the population.  That’s just one example but to me it’s the complexities of those elements for people to embrace a different way of believing.  So if we can’t succeed in that area it’s very difficult to imagine doing all of the other things that we need to do as successfully, as quickly as we need.  I think that’s probably the other thing, having both the urgency but also the patience for the long-haul.  We do our work every day.  It’s hard to get people excited or urgently engaged in policy development and yet we know that’s probably one of the biggest and most direct ways in which to influence the health of the public is through policy-related initiatives.  Yet, it takes time and energy, and we need a lot of people to come onboard with us.  Again, that’s an important strategy for us as public health leaders.  Then again, working with our medical care colleagues is also a critical element.  I find one of the most exciting parts of our job is actually working with the medical care system as they begin to define public health.  They may call it population health and we know it as public health.  There is differences in those terms but at the end of the day when we’re all working together to improve the health of people, that’s what it is all about.  To me, building strong relationships, creating win/win situations and incrementally changing our systems really is what will allow us to be successful.    Hugh Tilson:     You know our study is all about change and turnover too.  Think back to your onboarding.  You became a State Health Officer unexpectedly and very quickly.    Dr. Halverson:  Yes.    Hugh Tilson:     Were there some things about being a State Health Officer that you didn’t know but wished you had when you stepped into those shoes?    Dr. Halverson:  Oh my goodness, yes.  It’s interesting and you may remember I used to be at the CDC.  I spend a lot of time as the Director of the Division of Public Health Systems, Development and Research.  I thought I actually knew this job fairly well when I was at the CDC.  My entire division was focused on trying to support state and local health departments.  I worked very closely with colleagues at ASTHO.  Little did I know that I would actually be a State Health Officer and as you know when Dr. Boozman died unexpectedly in a farm accident it kind of got thrust upon me and it was one of the things that was a defining moment for me.  I recognized that job would fall to me through Governor Huckabee’s appointment.  I thought I knew it and I realized every day that I was in that job I realize I had so much to learn.  Through my colleagues at ASTHO and the health officers that I worked with across the country and especially in the surrounding states, I had a chance to learn.  If you remember during that period of time our public health laboratory, our very existence was at risk because of some technical violation.  Not to diminish it, it was an important issue, but I think I was the first public health laboratory in the country to be shut down.  Who knows what that’s all about.  All of a sudden even though I understood a little bit about how laboratories were working and certified, and understand it was an important undertaking to be able to get us back in business so that the people in Arkansas would be served by a functioning public health laboratory.  That was one issue among many that were initial obstacles.  The reality is that every day that you recognize as much as you study the science of public health and the importance of leadership you get a chance every day to try it out again.  The other thing is you recognize with nearly 10,000 that were in the employment either as an employee or contractor, that’s a lot of people.  Keeping everybody going in the same direction is a real task.  Communicating is so important and I perhaps underestimated how complicated and yet how important continuous communication and goal-oriented focus was in terms of communicating what is important and how things are going to change, and how they need to be part of it.  It’s a complicate job.  It’s a wonderful job, but I credit a lot of the success that we had to the training that I had both at CDC and the State Health Leadership Initiative.  A lot of good and important training that came, but also perhaps even more important is the relationships I’ve built with other State Health Officers and our colleagues at ASTHO who collectively created a supportive learning environment that allowed me to be able to take some of this knotty issues, have a conversation and learn from what others had done.  I think the worse part of being the State Health Officer would be hunkering down and trying to go it alone without any understanding of your peers, or what others have done before you.  For some reason, we in public health believe we have to reinvent everything.  The reality is that’s a really big waste of time.  We need to learn what has worked, initiate that and customize that if you need to.  We need to do a better job of networking and customizing known solutions.  I guess that was also an important learning for me.    Hugh Tilson:     We’re also learning departure and how you can prepare an agency for your leaving.  What was your experience in leaving Arkansas?  Was the agency prepared?  Should you have done something different?  How do agencies handle turnover?  Yours was not precipitous.  Sometimes they are precipitous.    Dr. Halverson:  Again, part of the issue is creating an organizational structure that makes sense, that is built upon good organizational design principles and then filling our top leadership positions with people that are both technically knowledgeable and experienced enough to stay the course.  I think that we were able to do that at the Arkansas Department of Health by being very selective in our appointments of senior staff.  Finding people who were in it for the long haul.  I was very fortunate to have an incredible senior staff, terrific people that ultimately succeeded me.  I’m pleased to say I think that for the most part the organization went on without too much of a hiccup.  First of all, I got more involved in national efforts for ASTHO and had the privilege of being the President of ASTHO for a year, then all of the activities related to being in national office.  I had a terrific deputy who ultimately became the State Health Officer.  Dr. Nate Smith is a terrific State Health Officer for Arkansas.  He has done an incredible job.  He was able, I think for the most part, to maintain the structure that we had developed.  There wasn’t a major departure strategically from what we had been doing and was able to maintain an important position, and have a continuity of both leadership and strategic initiatives.  That doesn’t mean that he hasn’t changed things and he needs to.  Organizations always need to change.  I believe part of the success of a SHO when he leaves, when he or she leaves, is that the organization needs to be able to move on without you and probably one of the greatest feelings of accomplishment that I had was to see that the organization was able to continue to function very smoothly.  It didn’t mean to say people didn’t wish me well and say goodbye, and I had a chance to thank them, but the organization needed to go on for the people in this state and it did.  The old adage when you first get this job, keep your resume in the right-hand drawer because you never know when you might need it.  People said that, I heard it, but I didn’t believe it.  Then you know over the years as I saw others leave pretty quickly after their appointment for various reasons, mostly not their fault, I realized that we’re in a very tenuous situation.  Maintaining good relationships and understanding that you are never guaranteed that next day but we need to make the most of every day that we get.  For me, when the opportunity came to be the Founding Dean at the Fairbanks School of Public Health, I was excited.  I think I was ready and the organization moved on.    Hugh Tilson:     Great segue to the next thing we need to talk about.  I think you may be the only Dean we’re interviewing in this project.  Talk about the relationship between academic public health and practice, particularly State Public Health.    Dr. Halverson:  Many would remind me when I was at CDC I railed about the disconnect that occurs and exists generally between academic programs or schools of public health and the practice.  Probably the biggest part of the issue is that schools of public health have incredibly dedicated faculty, most of which have never stood in a health department.  They had great intention.  They may not necessarily know what good public health practice looks like.  I’m really pleased to say my school of public health has chosen as its major strategic challenge, they want to be a school that makes a difference.  Advances the health of the people, the State of Indiana.  That’s a big difference.  There are schools, I believe, that just say look, we’re going to do great research and hopefully it will be fun to dwell.  We’re going to graduate a lot of students who will serve on committees and isn’t that enough?  I say to them, “It is not at all enough.”  Because if we don’t focus our attention on ultimately doing good research that is translatable to action, if we don’t train out students that are job ready, if we’re not focused on practice rather than simply serving on committees, then we’re not fully getting what public health is about.  So I am a strong believer that public health practice is that common ground between the schools and programs in public health, and the practice of public health demonstrated at a governmental agency, either at the local or state level.  That we need to have very explicit common ground and recognize that we’re in a partnership.  The state health agency has a responsibility to conduct public health and our job is to help support them and to help lead innovation that would ultimately lead to improved health.  We’re never going to have enough money to do all that we believe should be done, but if we are doing our job with our research we can find better and improved ways in which to make a difference.  If we continue to work on innovating in our teaching, our new public health officials with their degrees from our schools will do a great job and will help lead public health into the future in the new vistas that we have.  You can imagine it is an important partnership and when it’s working it is great.  The problem has been a disconnect between our funding in schools of public health and our needs in the practice world.  That’s something from a policy perspective that we need to address.  I think it takes a concentrated focus by both our Deans and our State Health Officials in particular to focus on what is really important and to find that common ground.    Hugh Tilson:     Paul, the future is extraordinary but particularly for state public health there are some great opportunities on the horizon.    Dr. Halverson:  I think there is an incredible opportunity as we think about the future.  Number one, I think our partners in the medical care system, health care systems are incredibly able and interested partners as we move away from fee for service to a value-based orientation as it is now important to them as it is to us to keep people healthy, to make people healthy, create conditions under which people can be healthy.  What has been our raise on that has been now also of interest and more than just a casual interest, but a business necessity for our health systems.  We can take advantage of that common interest and move towards a strategy of both integration and deployment of evidence-based strategies to protect and improve human health that we have never been able to do before.  We never had the money, we never had the influence, and now we have the opportunity to help drive an important chance in our states.  Secondly, I think as it is increasingly the case we’re in the middle of upheaval around health care reform and we need to put health into health care reform.  I think again we’re seeing great examples across the country on how public health is able to influence the deployment of a new version of health, especially as we think about Medicaid reform.  There isa lot of things that are perhaps challenging within our current health care system, one of which is the differences in our Medicaid program.  I believe regardless of what ultimately passes in our health reform legislation that there will be greater demands on our states to do something to customize, if you will, Medicaid to the needs of the people in each state.  I think that then creates the opportunity for health departments both local, state and schools of public health in those states to collaboratively work towards trying to better understand what the needs and opportunities are for changing the Medicaid program, which is such a vital and important safety net in our communities to being even better in terms of being able to address health issues for us.  The other thing is there is so many different ways in which we collectively need to concentrate our efforts.  I would suggest we need to find just two or three things in each of our states, develop coalitions and partnerships to move us towards that.  Move and work as hard as we can to really accomplish those things.  I’m not convinced there’s nothing we can’t do if we set our mind to it.  We have great science, we’ve got terrific leaders.  We’ve got great partners.  What else do you need?    Hugh Tilson:     A couple of second left.  First, give a shout out to being a State Health Officer after you no longer are a State Health Officer and that is the alumni.    Dr. Halverson:  Yes.  There is life after being a SHO.  It’s a terrific life.  I have had the privilege of serving as the President of the Alumni Association at ASTHO and I have contacts with incredible colleagues and dear friends.  That’s the one thing about being a State Health Official that is a little bit different than perhaps another occupation.  You are either a State Health Officer or you are a member of the Alumni Association and that’s it, or you’re dead I suppose.  That’s the whole strategy of keeping people and moving forward.  Yes, there is terrific opportunities after being a State Health Official and I think all of us have in common as alumni members, the importance of holding up, supporting and helping our current SHOs to be as successful as possible.  But ultimately, we’re all interested in the long game which is improving and protecting the health of the people of this country.    Hugh Tilson:     Finally, this is your bullet pulpit moment, Paul.  You are in front of the camera, talking to new SHOs probably.  What do you want new SHOs to know?    Dr. Halverson:  As a new SHO there is a lot of pressure for you to move forward and I think unfairly you think you have to be perfect, and you’re not.  The quicker you get over the idea that everything that you do, whether it’s every decision that you make or every speech that you do, or decision that you move forward on, it’s not going to be perfect.  We need to recognize that no matter how smart you are, you don’t know everything.  Most importantly, there is just help around the corner.  Call on colleagues, other state health officials, ASTHO, members of the Alumni Association.  Everyone is here to help.  We have a vested interest in your success.  As a State Health Official and new State Health Official you are entering a part of your life which I think will be the most exciting, most productive and perhaps in some cases the most frustrating job you’ve ever had.  It also is the most rewarding because when you can look in the eye of that child or that dad or mom that didn’t have hope before, that because of something you have done have a new feeling of hope and optimism for their life.  Then it’s all worth it.    Hugh Tilson:     Paul, it may be true that you aren’t perfect, but you’re mighty darn close.    Dr. Halverson:  You’re awfully kind, Dr. Tilson.    Hugh Tilson:     This has been a great conversation.    Dr. Halverson:  Thank you.   ### Bob Harmon, MD  Missouri, 1986-1990 Bob Harmon has been with Cerner Corporation since 2013 and currently is a senior physician executive for federal, state and local government clients. He previously served as director of the Duval County Health Department in Jacksonville, FL from 2006 to 2012, including three years overseeing jail healthcare. His health IT activities include serving as a member of the Governing Board and Sustainability Work Group of the Digital Bridge Initiative co-sponsored by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Public Health Informatics Institute and Deloitte.  Description of the video:  Hugh Tilson:     Hello.  You can tell I’m already having a great conversation with a friend of long-standing.  We don’t call each other old friends, Bob, Dr. Bob Harmon.  Bob is a member of the ASTHO Alumni Association, former State Health Officer in the State of Missouri.    Dr. Harmon:     Right.    Hugh Tilson:     He’s going to talk with us, of course, about his vision of what it means to be a successful state health official and what it will take to continue to make you a successful state health official.  I can hardly wait for that, Bob.  This is part of the de Beaumont funded University of Indiana Fairbanks School of Public Health project on the success of state public health officials with strong ASTHO support.  We thank them all and I can hardly wait for this conversation to get going further.  Bob, thanks for joining me.    Dr. Harmon:     Glad to be here.    Hugh Tilson:     So Bob, you’ve been there, done that.  What is your definition of success for a state health officer?    Dr. Harmon:     I think the first thing is to have a successful relationship with different leadership bodies in the state.  The Governor’s Office, the legislature, the local health departments, the non-profits so that you can have a successful agenda with your legislation.  Your budget is very important and the different programs.  Then with all of that to be able to continue in your job for a reasonable period of time so that you have long enough to bring those programs and initiatives to a successful completion and continuation.    Hugh Tilson:     Are there any ingredients for that success in the Agency or in the Governor’s Office that makes for a successful state health official?    Dr. Harmon:     It’s hard work.  Person-to-person relationships.  You have to get out of your office.  I believe you need to walk the halls of the legislature, establish good relationships with different legislative leaders, the committees, and so forth.  Bipartisan, both parties, as well as the Governor’s Office, whoever you report to.  You may not report to the Governor.  You may be in a division, so with your boss, with your superiors and then with your constituents.  Besides the people of the State, your constituents are often the local health departments and the non-profits.  The different organizations, state and local, and the other cabinet directors, the other agencies that you need to partner with, especially Medicaid if it’s not in your agency.    Hugh Tilson:     Think back to your days as a state health official and remind us where you served and what years.    Dr. Harmon:     Right.  Well I was the Director of the New Missouri Department of Health.  It had been a division of Public Health and Social Services Agency, so that was one of the exciting things and the drawing cards to take the position.  I started in 1986 and finished around 1990, around January, 1990.  I left to become the Administrator of Health Resources and Services Administration.    Hugh Tilson:     We want to talk more about that in just a few minutes.  Let’s just start at the very beginning.  Go back to your first day as a SHO.  Was there some things you wish you had known that you didn’t?    Dr. Harmon:     That was actually in the second survey and it would have been helpful to have known how much of a challenge some of the legislatures would be.  I learned that gradually.  Some who were quite supportive and then might change, some who were negative and didn’t change.  It depended on the issues and often depended on the party.  So it would have been helpful to have a heads-up on that, but I learned that quickly enough.  Otherwise I felt pretty well-prepared.  I had lived in Missouri before.  I had gone to Washington U and St. Louis for college and med school.  This was Jefferson City, the center of the state, but I felt pretty well-prepared.    Hugh Tilson:     Let’s have some fun with your recollections as a state health officer.  I want you to choose the toughest, biggest deal challenge as a state health officer.  An event, emergency, something that really taxed you and taxed your leadership skills.  Talk about that.    Dr. Harmon:     Probably my confirmation.  In some of the press coverage leading up I said that tobacco control, reducing tobacco use was going to be one of my top priorities and the most powerful lobbyists in the state, in the legislature was the tobacco industry rep who also had other big accounts.  Anheuser-Busch Beer, Monsanto Chemicals, so he was by far the most powerful.  He objected to taking that on and almost blocked my confirmation.    Hugh Tilson:     That will tax your leadership.  Let’s talk about you as a leader.  How does a leader confront that kind of situation?    Dr. Harmon:     Well, I worked closely with the Governor’s Office and with my sponsor, a State Senator for my confirmation and worked through that, and told them I would use a rational approach and not get too carried away.  Not try to move too fast and use a science-based approach so that they realized I wasn’t some kind of radical who must be stopped at the beginning.  I was confirmed on the last day.  They made me sweat.    Hugh Tilson:     Talk about integrity and trustworthiness as a leadership skill.  Obviously that was the trump card you played.  Talk about that.    Dr. Harmon:     It’s really important that you have trust and that you do what you say you’ll do.  That goes with your own staff, your own agency, with the Governor’s Office, with legislators, with your constituent people and organizations.  Its trustworthiness and competence, of course.  Do your homework.    Hugh Tilson:     Be evidence-based?    Dr. Harmon:     The harder I work, the smarter I get, the luckier I get.    Hugh Tilson:     One of the things that we’re look at in this study is turnover.  Precipitous departures and otherwise for state health officers.  Let’s talk about your departure.    Dr. Harmon:     Sure.  Well, I enjoyed being a state health officer but at some time in my career I wanted to have a chance at a federal public health position.  So I was very active in the associations.  ASTHO, for example.  I had been a County Public Health Director in Maricopa County, Phoenix, Arizona.  I was very active in NACCHO.  I was the President of NACHO.  I had a lot of good contacts including Dr. Jim Mason, who had been the head of the CBC.  He was appointed the Assistant Secretary for Health and he was the one who would recommend who the agency heads were when Bush One was elected.  I contacted Jim Mason.  I said, “Are you interested in people for the agency head jobs?”  “Sure,” he said.  “Put your name in the ring.”  So I did and I eventually heard that I was going to get an interview.  So I sort of planned ahead.  Not that I wanted to leave the position.  The Governor was, at that time, running for re-election.  No, he had just been re-elected and asked me to stay on.  So I could have stayed on.    Hugh Tilson:     One of the things we are looking at is how an agency can be prepared better for the departure of its Director.    Dr. Harmon:     Right.  Well, one of my top priorities from the beginning was to recruit the best people I could or promote the best people I could to my key appointed positions.  These were not political appointments.  I was the only political appointee in the new Department of Health.  I was able to continue, or promote, or appoint some really top people.  My Deputy was there when I got there, Charlie Stokes.  A really good Deputy who eventually became head of the CDC Foundation.  So I was really lucky to have him and he was a huge asset.  He and I worked together for the whole time.  I inherited some very good Division Directors, Garland Lan in Health and Vital Statistics, National Leader.  John Bagby in Disease Control, a pretty well-known guy.  So I recruited some good people as well.  Ross Brownson, I promoted and named head of a new division I created named after the CDC Center. It was a division of Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion.  He went on to do big things in academia at the St. Louis University School of Public Health when it began and he’s now been recruited over to the new Washington U Institute for Public Health, my alma mater.  So that was a good promotion and appointment as well.  Then when I left, I believe John Baby became the acting and I had recruited Colleen Kibblehand to be my Medical Director for Maternal and Child Health.  She became a future Director.  That became a succession plan of sorts.    Hugh Tilson:     Let’s talk about life after being a state officer.  You’ve had a great after SHO life but the particular area I would like you to talk about is relationships between State Public Health and medical care, and medical insurers.  You know something about that.    Dr. Harmon:     I do.  I put a lot of effort into my relationship with organized medicine.  I joined the State Medical Association and spent a lot of time with them, going to their annual conventions.  They were a huge ally.  I had a Board of Health also and some of their best people agreed to serve.  When things got rough I could count on the State Medical Association.  I’ve done that my entire public health career and my private sector career.  I’ve kept a close relationship to organized medicine, County, State or AMA.  Hospital Association, the most powerful trade association in the state.  I would go to their conventions.  I had a close relationship.  You couldn’t be too close because we regulated hospitals, but within the limits I got to know their executive director really well.  They generally would be very supportive unless I was trying to do something they didn’t like and then we’d agree to disagree.  Then I’m internal medicine as well as public health and preventive medicine, so I kept a close eye on what we were doing clinically as far as evidence-based practice and guidelines.  Whether it was MCH, HIV disease control or whatever.  I always took a personal interest.  I always tried to appoint a really good medical director or physician that I would want to work closely with them clinically as well as administratively.    Hugh Tilson:     What about insurers?    Dr. Harmon:     Yes, very important.  Medicaid was the most important insurer that I dealt with.  We didn’t have Medicaid Managed Care much in Missouri back then, but I kept in close touch with the Medicaid Program, the Medicaid Directors.  We used them as a pricing model and one of the things I accomplished, we had children with special health care needs, the Missouri Crippled Children Service and we had a crazy fee schedule which was always a headache.  I successfully engineered turning to accepting Medicaid fees.  The Hospital Association was a big against that because they were lower, but eventually they agreed and it is still the model.  My experience with Managed Care took a big leap when I joined United Health Group after HRSA and I was with them for 10 years as the National Medical Director for Optum, so I really got to know how huge the biggest health insurer operates.  I was in the Optum Division which is now huge and that was a really interesting experience.    Hugh Tilson:     Do State Health Officers get Optum and insurance or should they?    Dr. Harmon:     Well, they need a good relationship especially since those insurers now do a lot of Medicaid Managed Care.  That’s where you really need the relationships for low income patients that public health tends to serve.  So it’s good to have those relationships as well and they have Trade Association, the state equivalent of America’s health insurance plans.  It’s good to have that relationship too, especially relative to Medicaid.    Hugh Tilson:     Talk about the relationship between State Health Officers and ASTHO.    Dr. Harmon:     Yes, ASTHO was a huge resource to me.  I immediately became active in ASTHO when I took the Missouri job.  I worked my way up, got on the executive committee.  Great networking opportunities, lots to learn.  The State Health Leadership Program didn’t exist at the time in the late 1980’s but I did take advantage of the Harvard Kennedy School.  They had and still have the three-week summer institute for state and local government executives.  I went, and I think there were 80 of us.  I was one of maybe three or four public health people.  Others were state and local elected officials, legislatures, transportation, many different agency heads.  That was useful and I really enjoyed that.  I’m an alum of the Kennedy School and I served for 10 years on the RWJ Advisory Committee for the State Health Leadership Program.  I think it is a wonderful program.  I believe it was a one-week long and then a lot of self-study and home study.  I think that is a huge resource that every new State Health Officer ought to take advantage of.    Hugh Tilson:     Give a shout out to the ASTHO alumni.  Once a State Health Officer always a State Health Officer.    Dr. Harmon:     It’s a lot of fun.  We’re here at the annual meeting, the 75th Anniversary Meeting and there are quite a few alums here, a very active alumni council with officers.  Great support from ASTHO staff and we interface with the current State Health Officers and we have a lot we can learn from each other.  I’m really enjoying that.  That’s a bonus of being a State Health Officer.    Hugh Tilson:     One more fun thing for you.  Being a State Health Officer is exhilarating.  You never aren’t one once you have been one and you are always looking for new challenges.  Do a little exhortation of the new State health officers about the future.  What big challenges and opportunities do you see ahead for State Public Health?    Dr. Harmon:     Well, I think one of the biggest challenges always has been and will be in the future is finding the resources.  Public Health is woefully underfunded and I know that because I worked in the insurance sector which is well-funded.  Now the tech sector which is also well-funded.  Must of that driven by the high prices in medical care and the high prices charged by hospitals and ambulatory practices.  Public Health doesn’t benefit enough from that and we have to figure out ways to get some of those funds going into Public Health.  Medicaid is the place to look for partnerships and funding opportunities such as the 90% federal, 10% State matching funds for a lot of different things, including health information technology and exchange, and Medicaid-based pricing, special Medicaid reimbursement rates for local public health.  But then also, just the hard work of working with your state legislature for a better budget, always making the budget one of your top priorities when you are appointed, and spending a lot of time researching the budget and working with the budget committee or committees to get the most you can out of state general revenues and often the federal funds have to be improved too.  Then do not hesitate to work on federal grants.  A lot of those are competitive, have a really good grant writing machine in your state health agency and go after as much as makes sense.  Get to know the federal agencies where those grants come from.  Get a relationship with CDC, with HRSA, so that you maximize your grant income, as well    Hugh Tilson:     This has been fun.  Think about what you want to leave the viewers with.  There is probably going to be incoming SHOs who need to get their brain around what is this challenge, what is it like, how does it feel, what was it for Bob Harmon.  Do you have a last word or two for them?    Dr. Harmon:     Well, it’s one of the most enjoyable jobs I’ve ever had.  It was really fun.  It was challenging because of all the politics and the lack of funding, it was a continual effort. It’s like being head of a foundation.  You are continually trying to raise money, a non-profit.  Use ASTHO, use the resources of ASTHO.  It is a great way to learn quickly what lies ahead and the networking opportunities.  Get to know the State Health Officers in the neighboring states because you have cross-border issues.  Another important one is work closely with your local health department partners.  In maybe 10 of the states its unified and the locals are state employees.  That’s the way it is in Florida.  That makes it easier if you are all in the same agency.  In fact, if not, you really need to get to know them.  I visited all 112 local public health agencies in Missouri.  It took two and a half years, I think.  I created a partnership council with three large, three medium, and three small size health department reps.  We met monthly or quarterly, I can’t remember, but that’s where we dealt with challenging issues of funding formulas, funding distribution, big priority areas.  HIVA was a big one for me back then in the late 1980’s.  Then you can count on them as allies instead of opponents.  They were independent in Missouri.  They have their own relationship with legislators so when I go into town to visit with the local public health agency.  I would also visit the local legislator in his or her office locally.  I remember one time I was telling the Governor about this, John Ashcroft.  I had a very good relationship with John, and I said, “I’m trying to visit all of the local Public Health Agencies in the state.”  He looked at me and he said, “What are you running for?”  I said, “Well, nothing Governor.”  He was joking.  Have a good relationship with your Governor if you report directly to him.  You may not report to him and if you don’t report to the Governor have a very good relationship with your Agency Secretary or the leader of your Umbrella Agency.  Then, if possible, also have a good relationship with legislators or someone in the Governor’s Office.    Hugh Tilson:     This is a study about success as a State Health Officer.  Bob Harmon, you are the embodiment of success as the State Health Officer.  Thank you so much for this conversation.  I loved it.    Dr. Harmon:     You’re welcome.   ### Douglas Lloyd, MD, MPH FACPM  Connecticut, 1974-1987 Douglas Lloyd retired from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in 2007, where he worked for 16 years. He held several key public health positions, namely the director for the Center for Public Health Practice. Dr. Lloyd was the youngest cabinet level state health officer in the country at the age of 34 when he was sworn in as the Connecticut State Health Commissioner, in 1974. At the completion of his 13-year tenure as state health officer, he had been the longest-tenured cabinet level state health officer in the country.  Description of the video:  Tilson:              Well, hello. This is Hugh Tilson. I'm here having an unbelievably delightful reunion with a friend and colleague in state level public health of over 40 years—did I say that, Doug?—Dr. Doug Lloyd. You're going to get to…    Lloyd:               It was in the late 1800s.    Tilson:              It was in the 1800s, I think. Hugh Tilson here for the [inaudible 00:00:18] funded, ASTHO supported, University of Indiana Fairbanks School of Public Health project on public health success and leadership. I can't think of anybody better to talk with about that, Doug. Thanks for joining me.    Lloyd:               Thank you, Hugh. Glad to do it.    Tilson:              Good. All right, Doug. Thanks so much for doing this. This is good. Let's just start off with some recollection about you as a state health officer. As a state health officer, what does success mean? What is a successful state health officer?    Lloyd:               Well, times have changed so much, as you know, Hugh. We have a situation now where most of the health officers are at super agencies. I think one of the greatest parts of being a health officer in Connecticut is I reported directly to the governor, which was Tom Meskill and then Ella Grasso. When she died, that was Bill O'Neill.    Tilson:              What was success?    Lloyd:               Well, we were very successful in many different ways. First of all, we had the first hospice in the United States in Branford. I've been back to see that several times. I remember the day we got a call on the Lyme arthritis. Annie was my secretary. She said, \"There's this woman on the line, and she's nearly hysterical because of these large things on her.\" It was Lyme arthritis, named for Lyme, Connecticut. We were the second state in the United States to have a rate setting commission. That was back in the days of certificate of need. Of course, they don't do that now; they negotiate with health plans. We were the second state in the country to have an EMS system. Indiana, I think, was the first.    Tilson:              Name the ingredients for your success. What was it about you and the setting that made you successful?    Lloyd:               Well, it was interesting, because at 33, I was kind of young. I use the word somewhat advisedly. I had a little bit of chutzpah. I wasn't afraid to get out there. One of the things that I think is most important for a health officer, if you can do it—because you pretty near have to get the sign-off of the governor and everybody else—is to use the office of health officer as the bully pulpit, which means you get out there, and you get on television. You're not afraid of TV, and you tell the people in the state what kind of… If it's a national problem, you talk about what's the state implications. I did that quite frequently.    Tilson:              Let's talk about the biggest challenge you had. What was the toughest nut to crack as a state health officer, biggest challenge, biggest scandal about this job? What was the…?    Lloyd:               I don't know if you really want me to go into that.    Tilson:              No, I do.    Lloyd:               Okay. You're going to have to cut this one out. I got a call from Jay Jackson, who was in the governor's office. He said, \"Doesn't the medical examiner fall under you, Cathy Galvin?\" I said, \"Well, not really.\" They had reorganized the Commission on Medicolegal Investigation, because there was not… I was supposed to be ex officio, but because there was not a chair—[inaudible 00:03:45] Harry Goucher had had a heart attack—I became the chairman of the commission. Jay said, \"What about Cathy Galvin? Does she report to you?\" I said, \"No. What's the problem?\" He says, \"Well, there are people coming in here and saying that her dogs are eating human remains off the autopsy table.\" My first reaction was, \"Oh, that can't be true.\" I called Cathy up, and I said, \"Cathy, it's time for a tenure review.\" The day that she was supposed to come in and see me she had the flu, and she didn't.    Anyway, we went over… There are no mountains in Connecticut. We went over the other side of the [inaudible 00:04:32] ridge into Avon. We met and we talked about it. That was when some of the comments that came out unfortunately were not leaked to the press, because the guy from Yale said, \"Well, if she does her job well, there's enough for the DA and/or the dogs.\" That's a true quote. Anyway, what we did is we accepted her resignation. Dick Lynch was the district attorney and state's attorney. He said we could accept her resignation, which is what we did. In essence, we fired her. It's interesting that she sued all of us for $10 million, but small state we knew the [inaudible 00:05:28]. My biggest challenge was not strictly the regular public health but a scandal because of her. As recently as a couple weeks ago, I was talking to the guy we put in as medical examiner, Wayne Carver. Wayne Carver was the guy who was my ME who did all the autopsies at Sandy Hook. That's one of the things we talked about here, about gun violence. That's still a problem. It was a problem then; it's a problem now.    Tilson:              You learned an awful lot. Remember we're talking to future state health officers. Talk about leadership lessons you learned when you have a scandal.    Lloyd:               Well, first of all, I made one big mistake. I was a regular on Channel 3. I had a show called Dr. Doug, which was House Call. I made the mistake of… I had those ear pieces [inaudible 00:06:28]. I made a mistake of taking the first question from Don Larch from Channel 3. The other stations were very competitive in Connecticut. When that happened, the press conference was over, because they knew that I was being Dr. Doug instead of the representative of the governor. I think you always have to be very cognizant of who's in the State House, and you have to work with them. It doesn't hurt any health officer, no matter where you are in the pecking order, to get to know the legislators. They're the ones that make the difference on your budget.    Tilson:              Sure are. How old were you when you took your…?    Lloyd:               33.    Tilson:              What do you wish you had known that first day when you came into the office that you didn't? What surprised you about being a state health officer?    Lloyd:               The first day I came in—I remember it very clearly—I walked into the office. They had been withholding food and water from a bunch of nursing home patients. I was asked, \"Is that murder or homicide?\" I think I said it was homicide. I was very nonplussed by that one. Let's talk about leadership skills. I had gone through, after I was a health officer, late in my career, the Leadership Institute. I wish maybe I'd had that before I started.    Tilson:              Let's segue to one of the focuses of our study. We're looking at turnover of health officers who leave prematurely. Now, how do you prepare an agency…? Well, first of all, what was the impact of your departure in Connecticut?    Lloyd:               Relief. [laughter] No, actually when Ella died, Ella was being vetted by Jimmy Carter to be Jimmy's vice presidential candidate. She died before that was finished. Consequently, we really didn't have a shakeup. I remember the day that Bill O'Neill took over. He was sweating because we were closing two hospitals, Laurel Heights and Shelton. He kept everybody in that administration in one more term. Then he asked for letters of resignation and, of course, we submitted them. I rambled around for awhile. The first thing I did was clinical trials in Hartford. I had to leave that one because I had worked with a guy… I didn't particularly trust him. He was a doctor. I went ahead, and we were doing a clinical trial on a woman. She had a history of cardiac disease. I said, \"You can't put her in this study.\" He said, \"Okay.\" Unfortunately, he did, and she died.    Tilson:              Go back to the agency. What difference does it make to the agency that you left?    Lloyd:               Well, fortunately, I had some very good people that were working with me that were able to take over the agency. I think the agency—and from what I've seen since I've gone back several times—fared very well without my leadership.    Tilson:              Is there anything you can do to prepare an agency for health officers leaving? You know they're leaving with very short tenure these days?    Lloyd:               Oh, yeah. I lasted 13 years. It was a record at the time. Well, I think the thing that you have to do is you have to look at who your chief lieutenants are. Who are the people that are going to assume the responsibility for your agency? You have to be sure that they're well-trained, that they know about leadership, that they know about being able to approach whoever's the head of the agency and bring anything that is going to end up in the front pages but especially anything that's going to be a health hazard to the people of the state.    Tilson:              Great answer. You went on to do some federal work, I understand.    Lloyd:               Yes, I did.    Tilson:              What did you do?    Lloyd:               Well, after the clinical trials, I set up a course for judges to learn risk assessment. That time was the time of the Delaney clause, which said if you find any cancer in laboratory animals, you have to ban it. I set up an organization called the International Life Sciences Institute, which still exists here. Then after that, we had [inaudible 00:11:19] and we set up the panel for judges, because we found out that federal judges didn't know anything about risk assessment. Then after that, I ran into Bob Harmon who I'd known as a health officer. He offered me a job with HRSA, and I went to HRSA. I was there until I retired in 2007.    Tilson:              I remember it as though it were yesterday, Doug. What I want you to talk with me about is the relationship between the state health officer and federal agencies, particularly your perspective on HRSA. What was the relationship with [inaudible 00:12:01]? What do we need to do to help that?    Lloyd:               Well, I think the relationship between a state health officer and the federal people is usually pretty good. I don't know what they do now, but in our days, we could get an EIS officer assigned to the agency, and it was no question. You might have a state epidemiologist, but the EIS officer… That's the one that went out when we had the case of Lyme arthritis was the EIS officer. I think the relationship with the federal agencies is extremely important, especially with the CDC.    Tilson:              Thinking back to your time as a state health officer, was there anything that the federal agencies should have done to help you better?    Lloyd:               Well, there was a discussion at the time that's not relevant any more. One of the problems with being a state health officer and having such rapid turnover is you don't really ever seem to get vested in a system. I don't know if that's been solved since then, but there needs to be some system whereby a health officer gets vested in some system. Very often, as you know, we go from state to state. I did not. Otherwise, you're left without a pension. I think that's something that has to be addressed.    Tilson:              Let's try to wind this interview down with some futurizing. You've been around a long time. What do you think the greatest challenges are for public health today? That is, the new state health officers, what are they facing and greatest opportunities?    Lloyd:               Well, the greatest challenge, I think, is that you have to be fast on your feet, that you have to be current with… If you're not current with the literature, you've got to have somebody in your agency that's current with the literature. You've got to know what the next… You've got to be able to look into your crystal ball and predict the possibility of your next big problem. It probably also is a very good idea to get around the state, as I did, and meet with the people. Talk to the people out there and say, \"What do you think the problem is?\" That way you learn something that you don't really necessarily get when you're insular within the agency.    Tilson:              Hold on just a second while that siren goes by. Okay, he's not coming our way. What about opportunities? Is there a big opportunity for public health these days? If so, what do you think it is?    Lloyd:               Oh, there's no question. After all, the name, it's the public's health, and the public is always going to need assistance. Now, we can't guarantee health. We can tell the people that we preach to sometimes what healthy habits are. We have to understand that people eventually have to take control of their own health. What they really need a lot of help with nowadays is learning about the health care field, where we have so many different insurance plans, and questions of affordable care, and things of that nature. When the public wants to know more about that, the health officer should probably be involved.    Tilson:              Is there anything else you…? What do you want to say to the next generation of state health officers? [inaudible 00:15:23] They're going to be watching this interview. What message do you want to leave them with?    Lloyd:               It is, without a question, one of the most exciting, rewarding jobs that you could have. Personally, you get a sense of satisfaction. You get the slings and arrows. Sometimes you get the arrows, especially when you do things that they consider maybe a little bit out of the ordinary, but what you do is you get the satisfaction of serving the public. To me, I'm not being patriotic, but I happen to think that's a very high calling.    Tilson:              I want you to think about gun control.    Lloyd:               Oh, boy, gun control. Well, gun control is something that I feel very strongly about for a reason. I was a state health officer in Connecticut when Sandy Hook happened. My medical examiner, Wayne Carver, was the one that went down and did the autopsies on all those kids and the teachers. Gun violence is still a problem. I brought that up down in a session earlier today. There are 350 million guns in this country. That's more than one gun for every man, woman, and child. Now, I'm not anti-gun. My brother's got a Glock. I went out and fired it with him. Part of the problem is the guns get in the hands of the wrong people. We need to vet people much more closely before they get a license to carry a firearm. Right there is… I hate to say 007, but with a hand gun, it's a license to kill. You and I both know of our colleagues who think very strongly that gun violence is a major issue, and it still is. Maybe it won't immediately get there, but it will continue to come up.    Tilson:              What do we say to the people who get righteously indignant, indeed, furious, with public health people when we bring it up? Think out loud about the challenge to public health…    Lloyd:               I've done that in my own family. My brother carries a Glock. He tells me to mind my own business on it and so does his friends. You try desperately to show them the statistics, and you try to show them that it is a problem. It's not a problem with guns. We don't have a problem with a hunter. We don't have a problem with the person who goes out and does target shooting. We have a problem with the guns in the hands of the wrong people. With 350 million guns out there, you can almost guarantee that there will be another Columbine, or Sandy Hook, or whatever.    Tilson:              What do we do?    Lloyd:               Well, first of all, I don't think we… We don't let our vigilance drop for a second. We continue at it. There was a gentleman who recently spoke here at our meeting. He talked about what he was doing at his state, meeting with various gun groups and getting them to talk about lock boxes and things like that. There's a lot of things that we can do. I don't think in the next five… With the power of the NRA and the people from Congress would take the money out of the CDC budget, I don't think we're going to get a… The second amendment was passed, not that everybody could have a gun. The second amendment was passed so that states could organize militias and not that everybody could carry a gun. That's why we have a second amendment. Now, Wayne LaPierre of the NRA happens to think different about that. I don't think we can let it off our radar screen. The other thing—we can keep statistics at the state level on gun violence. It's just that the CDC can't keep statistics.    Tilson:              Any word of wisdom for the ASTHO alumni? What difference can former state health officers make?    Lloyd:               First of all, I don't think we should, as former health officers, as former [inaudible 00:19:56], we should ever forget the amount… Albert Einstein once said, \"There is no such thing as knowledge; there is only experience.\" We have had the experience—at least, I have—since the early 1970s of an enormous amount of information. We can be helpful. The one thing that I learned this last year is that you may forget something for a little while, but if you see something, it triggers another memory, and then another memory, and then you remember about it. I call it the [inaudible 00:20:30] factor, because I remember about the [inaudible 00:20:32] when I was going to have a cardiac MRI. You're always going to be helpful. Even if it's pro bono, you ought to let yourself be known to your local, state, or county health officer that you're available. Work in the legislature. We all have had experiences doing that. We can help. If we're from out of state and we're new, like I am in Texas right now, maybe it's limited, but we can give the advice to the health officer. We don't have to be the guy out there, but we can give the advice to the health officer of how we would have handled it had we had the opportunity.    Tilson:              Dr. Doug Lloyd, the voice of experience, always willing to help and, obviously, still a great help. Thank you for joining me, Doug.    Lloyd:               Thank you, sir.   ### John Lumpkin, MD  Illinois, 1990-2003 John Lumpkin is the senior vice president of programs at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Description of the video:  Interviewer:     Hi and welcome to this interview that I’m having – a continuous conversation is what it is, John – with Dr. John Lumpkin from the State Health Office of the state of Illinois with an illustrious career since then. We’re going to have a chance to learn a lot about that and his definitions of success for the Health State Office because this is part of a series of interviews that we’re doing for the University of Indiana, Fairbanks School of Public Health, about public health leadership and success and the ingredients that make it so. This is a de Beaumont-sponsored project and we thank de Beaumont for that and an ASTHO-supported project as well. We couldn’t do without ASTHO and of course, we couldn’t without state public health leaders like you, John. Thank you for joining me today!    Lumpkin:          Great! Thank you! It’s a pleasure to be here!    Interviewer:     So, John, this is a study of success factors for State Public Health Officers, so let’s just start at the beginning. What’s your definition of success as a State Health Officer? What is that?    Lumpkin:          I think success of a Public Health Officer at the state level is threefold to the extent that they create the conditions in which local public health can be successful. Health and public health occurs at the local level where people live, learn, work and play. The State Health Agency’s primary job is to make sure that that happens at the local level and that could occur through working through local health agencies or through direct action by the State Health Agency itself. The second measure of success is to the extent in which the broader health context is addressed. That means initially working with other state agencies whose primary purpose may not be health, but who have a direct impact upon the health of the people in that state. That includes the Department of Education, Department of Transportation, as well as others that are more likely suspects like Human Services. Then, the third measure of success is the extent in which the Public Health Director, the Public Health Official improves the functioning of their agency through adoption of quality-improvement methods, through the focus on innovation and a persistence of focus upon the workforce to help improve the qualifications and capacity of that workforce to be able to carry out our continuing public health mission.    Interviewer:     I love that answer and it doesn’t surprise me a bit that you’ve given all the leadership of yours over the years, subsequently as well that you had come down there.Help people who are a little new in state public health to understand the ingredients of that success. What does it take within the agency or the context to create the success that you’ve talked about?    Lumpkin:          It’s critical for the Lead Public Health Official of the state to be the health leader and that means not just coming up with great ideas – that’s important – but also interfacing and working with the people throughout the state who are engaged in it. First measure of success – creating the conditions in which local public health agencies can be successful. That means working with Public Health Directors, that means working with individual communities and so, just focusing on what happens at the state capital or within the offices of the Public Health Agency isn’t enough. It means building that network. Sometimes, it means interfacing. During my career, we had at some point a major schism between small local health departments and the larger local health departments. It probably wouldn’t surprise you that the biggest part of that was about money. Where were the resources going? It’s important for a Public Health Director, for an Agency Lead, to understand not only the conditions in urban communities, but also the conditions in rural communities because we find as a nation that if we want to improve health, we have to reduce disparities and the disparities that exist within urban communities are equally as great as the disparities that exist between urban and rural. The second area of success – and the skill that’s required – is reaching out to other agencies and other forces. That means understanding the importance of coalitions – what they now call“collective action” – of bringing together unusual suspects, unusual bedfellows, people who don’t know normally work together. For that, let me give an example of what I think may be the biggest increase improvement that we can do in health as a nation. It’s surprising to come from somebody in public health, but I would say that that could be something like universal pre-k. You just sort of follow the logic chain through. Children who participate in pre-k have better socio-emotional skills, they always make some better citizens, but they’re also more likely to finish high school. At the age of 25, someone who has not finished high school, when you compare them to somebody who’s graduated from college, the difference in life expectancy is nine years. When you think about an intervention that could have an impact of nine years of life expectancy, you’ve got to talk to the folks in education and public health leaders need to see that broader context and bring people into the room, not to do public health work, not to bring them in the room and talk about restaurant inspections, but to talk about how if they do their job related to enhancing education, it has an impact upon health, how transportation and the ability of people to get to appointments, to be able to work, has an impact upon health. All of those within that broad concept is what a public health leader or the health leader for the state – that’s how they can have an impact. The third area that I talked about is building the agency. We live in a time where the best days for funding for public health agencies may be behind us. We can do one of two things. We could lament the fact that our budgets aren’t as big as they have been – certainly, if you figure out in present dollars – or we can figure out how to deliver public health services with the resources that we have. There is an assumption that because we’ve always done it this way that that means that’s the most effective and efficient way. I think we have to give into the modern era and think about comparative effectiveness of public health interventions, of increasing the effect of this and efficiency of the public health dollars. If we do that, we can enhance the functioning of our agency. We also need to think about our personnel. We need individuals, we need to build partners with the Schools of Public Health so that the graduates from schools of public health actually think about going into Government or Public Health and we need to think about ways to hire them because too many of those graduates who have the skills we need leave school and they can’t find a job. So, developing that linkage is how you build the public health workforce within your agency.    Interviewer:     Great and specific and I thank you! Let’s get even more specific. Remind us what years you were in service as a State Health Officer.    Lumpkin:          I was first appointed in 1990 and I left in 2003.    Interviewer:     During that time, you had so many challenges. Just name one issue that was among the most challenging, most exciting that you had to confront and talk about leadership lessons you’ve learnt in confronting it. Would you give us a specific of your experience as a show?    Lumpkin:          My guess is that every State Health Official who was a State Health Official in 2001 would say that the events that happened on September 11 th and actually, subsequently in October with anthrax, was a wake-up moment. For me, it really was a culmination of the work that we had begun in the agency many years prior to that and it was sort of a validation of an approach. It was our major challenge. It’s hard to describe the environment when those first anthrax cases were reported, where we were getting calls from day-care centers. They were talking about, “Oh, we’ve discovered a white powder by the changing table.” Well, was anybody using baby powder? Someone got a letter full of white powder and we said, “Where did it come from?” “It came from my daughter.” “Did you ask her if she sent it?” “Oh…” When we went back, “Yes, she actually thought I didn’t have any baking powder, so she sent the recipe with the baking powder in the envelope.” There was a mass hysteria around this, but part of what our response was building upon the partnerships that we had built. Partnerships with the State Police who worked very closely with us around all the reports of white powder so that our laboratories were not overwhelmed, the ability of our laboratories to do the kinds of molecular biology to test whether or not these samples actually might have anthrax. All of that was based upon prior work and the ability to work with our Emergency Management Agency. That all put in place our ability to respond to this challenge by some of the work that we had done prior. For example, about three years before that, we had an activation of our State Emergency Operation Center. It was about 11 o’clock at night and we’re sitting in the center because there was a report of a laboratory that was found in one of the western suburbs of Chicago. It appeared to be a bio level four laboratory. We were sitting there with the Director of Emergency Operations Center, we had one of our employees who was trained because he had come in from a police background, a military background and how to use biohazard suits and they were entering the laboratory to try to determine what exactly was going on. We had the FBI on the launch pad at Quantico ready to come in and help out if we could in fact determine that this was a risk. As we were getting the description from our staff who was in there with signs on the wall that said, “Go! Bugs grow!” All of a sudden, something clicked in my mind. It had been an earlier investigation about fraud and it turns out that this actually had been a case that the Attorney General was investigating because they had a simulated bio level four lab and they were bringing in potential investors in this new innovation. When I brought those together and brought it to the Emergency Management Agency at one o’clock in the morning and the Head of the State Police at one o’clock in the morning, they began to realize. In fact, the Head of the Emergency Management Agency said that every disaster has a public health component. A week after September 11 th , we began to respond and I was sitting in the Emergency Operation Center. We knew each other’s names. You never want to get into a disaster situation and exchange business cards. You want to work with people you’ve worked with and solve things through. The second thing that we had done to prepare for that was recognize the importance of bio terrorism as a public health challenge, much as current public health officials or state health officials in 2017 have identified ahead of time the challenge of the opioid epidemic and to make plans in place and to recognize that you can’t always get funded when you think you have a need, but if you explore and put plans in place, when there’s an opportunity, you can actually get funded. We had wanted to expand our laboratory to include molecular biology and we had put it in our budget and the Bureau of the Budget said no and the Governor’s Office said no, and we put it in the budget the next year and the same answers. Then, there was an outbreak of invasive group A strep, also called “flesh-eating bacteria”, and it was in a small town in central Illinois and at that point, there were a lot of news and the Governor’s Office and the Bureau of Budget said, “What’s going to be our response?” My response was, “We need to expand our laboratory.” Half a million dollars immediately became available. We built in that molecular biology capacity. If I hadn’t been ready for that answer and I couldn’t say, “This is exactly how we spend it,” it would’ve been a missed opportunity and we would not have been available in 2001 to have that laboratory enable us to respond to the thousands white powder evaluations we had to do. It’s identifying where the challenges are, looking at opportunities and then, taking that opportunity when it presents itself to move forward the public health agenda.    Interviewer:     I wasn’t about to step on that line. One of the things we’re looking at in our study is how the agency or people recruiting the new show can help state health officers to be successful early or fast. Are there some things you wish you would’ve known when you became a State Health Official?    Lumpkin:          I was in a somewhat different position than a number of shows. I had been in the agency for five years before I was appointed State Health Director and I was very familiar with a number of the people both in the legislature, but also within the agency. The challenge of coming in as a new state health official, particularly if you haven’t been in the department, is you have to know the people in your agency and you have to know who is good and you have to know who is not good. That becomes really important because coming into an agency, you sometimes don’t appreciate the dedication of state employees and also, the difficulty in recruiting people with certain credentials. One of the things I had done – and it took me a while – is I was able to recruit a PhD epidemiologist to head up our epidemiology section. It took me years to find this individual. My successor, when they came in, thought that was someone who was part of the old administration and pushed him out of the agency and the agency still does not have a PhD epidemiologist. It’s coming into the position and knowing the importance of certain skill sets to be able to carry out the public health mission is one important thing. For me, personally, the one thing I wish I had known more about was the public health service core. I came into public health out of the field of emergency medicine. I wasn’t really familiar with the core and I think that that is a critical national resource. I think I would’ve either personally thought about being involved in the core or getting those officers in the core more involved in the work with the agency because times change, leadership changes, but the core has a certain amount of consistency that I think you can provide at the state level, that it currently provides at the national level.    Interviewer:     Great idea! Thanks for planting it! Let’s talk about your departure. Agencies experience departures of state health officers, sometimes precipitous, sometimes planned. What’s the impact of turnover, of departure of the State Health Officer on the agency and its ability to continue?    Lumpkin:          When I think about turnover within agencies and turnover in leadership, sometimes that’s something that’s very difficult to plan for and figure out how to do in a good way. When I came into the agency, I followed Bernard Turnock. He was our State Health Director, he had brought me into the agency and I learnt a lot of things and what to do. In fact, the transition was a little bit strange. I was State Health Director for about four or five months and I was down in southern Illinois and we were doing a visit with the Regional Office and I was talking about how we were following through on Barney Turnock’s initiatives and one of the regional health officers said, “You know, you can do your own initiatives, too.” I was doing them, but it really put it in a different context that now, I was the leader. Alternatively, other transitions that I’ve seen where I left, the new administration came in, not just at the State Health Department, but in the Governor’s Office and throughout State Government saying, “We’re throwing the bums out and we’re going to do everything different.” Somewhere in there needs to be a middle ground and I think transitions help best if the new person coming in recognizes what was positive about the other agency and at the same times, begins to implement their own ideas.    Interviewer:     Are there some things agencies can do to prepare for departure, particularly for some of the more precipitous ones or short-term state health officers? Is there something we can do to shore up the agency’s resiliency to handle top-level turnover?    Lumpkin:          Agencies have a role to play in thinking about how to manage turnover and the lead person, the state health official. Some of the things that they can do is think about their operations, clearly document everything that you’re doing in the sense that the manuals, should someone new come in,is not something that you have to do. You do that during transition. You develop a transition report when you have a new governor. Why not have it as an ongoing document so you’re ready in case there was a transition in state health official? If there isn’t, you’re still ready if you to do a transition report for a new governor anyway, so it helps you get that process. The second – and this is really critical for the role of the state health official – they are not all of the show. That is an important thing to remember. If you don’t function in such a way that you’re delegating authority and not just delegating authority to your tight circle most of whom serve it well, but also delegating authority throughout the agency so that if there is a change at the top, you’ve got policies, procedures and ways of operating where people feel they have the autonomy and the ability to make good choices, to carry out innovation. At that point, you begin to protect the agency from changes in leadership because you build in that resilience through a strong infrastructure.    Interviewer:     Let’s talk about life as a former show. You’ve done quite well. Maybe we should talk about relationships between state public health and philanthropies, maybe using your experience with RWJ. How can shows work well with philanthropies?    Lumpkin:          Let me talk about the questions of how state health agencies can work with philanthropies. It’s critical for a state health official to recognize that there are many types of philanthropies. First, there is a tendency to look at larger organizations like the one I worked for – the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation – and say, “How do I build a relationship with them?” That’s not really the most critical. Every state, every region has regional philanthropies. In Missouri, there is the Missouri Health Foundation. In New York State, there is the New York State Health Foundation. These regional philanthropies, many of which were formed as a conversion from a not for-profit to a for-profit hospital or healthcare system or insurance company, have significant resources and they tend not to have a relationship with the health department, but my guess is predominantly because the health department has never come to talk to them. Seek out those philanthropies. In some locations, particularly large cities, they have funder collaboratives. Seek out those collaboratives and talk about the priorities of the state health department. You may not get interest immediately, but if you begin to talk about the broader context of health, you may find that these philanthropies become critical partners and they will be very interested not in funding the state health department, but funding your initiatives and funding your initiatives at the community level. That’s a partnership I didn’t really appreciate when I was State Health Official that I’ve seen now from the other side and said, “That’s a critical approach to take in thinking about engagement between state health officers, state health agencies and philanthropy.”    Interviewer:     Give me a pep talk for people who are former state health officials about ASTHO and ASTHO alumni. What difference could we make?    Lumpkin:          One of the important questions for state health officials as they are thinking about the end of their term is to think about the broader health context and how you are positioning yourselves. Just as I talked about the role of the state health department is to create the conditions in which local health departments can be successful, in many ways, I look upon that as the role of the CDC and other federal agencies in creating the conditions in which state and local health departments can be successful. They don’t always get it. Part of the role of the state health official is to not only work within the state, but to think about the broader national context and to be engaged not only with things within your state, but also nationally and that means in a couple of ways. One is by working with ASTHO. ASTHO is a critical organization because it’s the voice of State Public Health throughout the nation and most importantly, it’s the voice of State Public Health in Washington. Get engaged with agencies of the Department of Health in Human Services or Agriculture or WIC because it’s important for the voice of state public health to be heard there. It’s also critical to do those things as part of your own personal transition planning. When you think about your next step, the first thing people do is begin to network and it’s very similar to the situation in a disaster. A disaster is not the time to share business cards and when you’re looking for a job because there’s a change in administration or because there’s been some disaster that it’s time for you to leave, that’s not the time to begin to exchange business cards and think about your next job. Carrying out your job as a state health official, networking with in-state, but across the nation, also positions you to have an environment in which you can begin to network and think about your next position.    Interviewer:     Once you’re in the next position, can you continue to advance the cause of state public health?    Lumpkin:          I think it’s really critical for state health officials. Once they’ve left their positions as former state health officials, I think it’s absolutely critical to not give up the fight. What you’ve experienced is something that only a small number of people have experienced. It gives you an insight that only a small number of people have and it is your responsibility to carry that insight with you into your next position and the position after that. That means thinking about, whether you’re working in a healthcare entity or a government agency or even in philanthropy, how you can carry forward what you’ve learnt and continue to build the public health mission. Public health cannot be successful solely by itself. It can only be successful building those partnerships and once you leave that role as a state health official, you can help build those partnerships in your other position. Finally, it’s absolutely critical – I found one of the things that have been most rewarding –is working in the ASTHO Alumni Association and having the ability to continue to interface with my colleagues in current shows made me more successful in my job, but it’s also been more fulfilling because again, it’s a club with very small membership and not everyone understands what you’ve gone through, but they do.    Interviewer:     I’m having a great conversation! John, thanks for taking the time. I didn’t want to miss the opportunity to hear your vision of what’s next on the horizon, next exciting challenge or opportunity for public health.    Lumpkin:          When I think about the next exciting challenge for public health, I’m really struck by what we’re doing at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the concept of building a culture of health. That has really been exciting for us, but I think it should be exciting for public health at large, but also for state public health agencies. It begins to put in the context of what we do in public health. Every time I work on this, I think back to 1996. We were involved Illinois in an initiative related to reducing infant mortality in Grand Boulevard. It’s a very poor community in the south side of Chicago. At the time, 60% of the people living in that community lived in large conjugate public housing and we went to talk to them about infant mortality. They wanted to talk about economic development. We said, “We’re the Public Health Agency. We don’t do economic development. We do infant mortality.” We went round and round and all of a sudden, it was this “aha” moment. The leading risk factor for infant mortality is poverty and we were not listening. I once had a professor when I was training in emergency medicine who said, “If you listen to the patient long enough, they will tell you what’s wrong with them.” In public health, if we listen to the communities long enough, they will actually tell us what needs to be done. So, we took that program and infant mortality and we hired peer case managers – people from the community to be case managers. We set up a WIC program where we went away from the normal WIC stores where there was fraud and abuse and we set up system where people could go in there with WIC coupons and we hired people from the community to run these WIC-only stores. We set up arrangements whereby once they were trained by the WIC-only store, they would then be hired by the large chains. We merged and used our public health dollars as part of economic development in the community. It’s this broader concept, the broader way of thinking about how we in public health can engage this broader concept. That is really where excitement comes. We think about health-impact assessments and we think about working with businesses and transportation and all of a sudden, that public health vision becomes so much closer than it’s ever been. If that isn’t exciting, I don’t know what is!    Interviewer:     I’m with you, John! Anything else you want to say to particularly a group of new or incoming shows because this video will be viewed by them? Any last words of wisdom for the new class of shows?    Lumpkin:          If I were to give a message to someone who is a new state health official, having told them how they need to work with other agencies, how they need to work within the agencies, how their funds are going to be restricted, this is the best job in the world. This will be some of the best times of your life. Take time to pause, to enjoy the moment, to recognize the importance of what you’re doing and how rewarding this can be because it’s too easy to focus on the challenges and too easy to focus on the problems and that center who’s been giving you grief, but think about what you’ve been doing and what you can do. That, I think, is really the joy of this position.    Interviewer:     I conclude that your professor of emergency medicine was right. If you listen to John Lumpkin long enough, you’ll get an insight into what you need to do. Thank you, John! This was just wonderful!    Lumpkin:          Thank you!   ### Judith Monroe, MD  Indiana, 2005-2010 Judith Monroe’s professional focus has centered on the intersection of primary care and public health. Her career has taken her from private medical practice to academia, hospital administration, and public health protection. In February 2016, Monroe was named president and CEO of the CDC Foundation. Prior to joining the CDC Foundation, Monroe worked for six years as a CDC deputy director and served as director of the Office for State, Tribal, Local and Territorial Support (OSTLTS).  Read Monroe's full biography  Description of the video:  Tilson:              Hi, I'm Hugh Tilson, on the faculty of the Fairbanks School of Public Health and here for a project that Fairbanks, Indiana, School of Public Health is doing thanks to the funding from the de Beaumont Foundation and strong support from ASTHO. I'm here talking with you, Judy Monroe. It's wonderful to see you, as always. Thank you for joining us. The subject here is how to be successful as a state health officer. I can't think of anybody better to talk with, with that, than you, former state health officer for the state of Indiana.    Monroe:           Thank you. Good to be with you.    Tilson:              Glad you're here. Judy, let's start at the beginning. The subject is successful state health officers. What is your definition of a successful state health officer?    Monroe:           I have to tell you, Hugh, my definition of a successful state health officer is someone, to be honest, first and foremost, that enjoys the job and enjoys engaging with the public, and with the legislators, and with their governor and all the stakeholders, because I think that's one of the keys to success. Going from there, if you get those relationships well established and you're enjoying it, then you can take on the challenges. Honestly, as a state health officer you do want to see some policy advance. So that's one of the successes is if you've advanced really good public health policy in your state, which is not an easy thing to accomplish, by the way. If you get the stakeholders and the coalitions, begin to build coalitions or promote coalitions that have already been established that are actually doing good work, I think that's another characteristic of a successful state health officer.    Tilson:              Let's talk about the ingredients of that success, then. What are the attributes of a successful health officer? Describe one for me.    Monroe:           I think the first attribute is actually listening. When I was state health officer I found that regardless of whether it was the governor, the legislators or the constituents that would come with their issue that they wanted me to help advance, I would start by listening and trying to understand. I think then from there, when you're communicating as a state health officer, the ability to tell a good story. Story telling is honesetly, it's gold, regardless of which audience that you're speaking with, and marrying that with data. And making sure that as a state health officer, and this is something I did right of the gate, I made sure that all my audiences knew that I would be data-driven and that I would be seeking the best data available for the day, regardless of what the issue was. But if I really wanted to capture the imagination of any audience, I had to have a story. That's the way we've learned as human beings for a long time, and it makes a big difference.    Tilson:              Let's talk about challenges. You were state health officer in Indiana during a time when there were a lot of challenges in public health. Do you want to name one of your favorite challenge and talk about it a little bit?    Monroe:           Well, I would tell you, on the national scale, as well as state and local, was H1N1. I was president of ASTHO, and I was state health officer, during the H1N1 pandemic. I found myself in a leadership role on multiple levels. We had a lot of challenges during H1N1. You know, the vaccine was supposed to be available at a certain time. Everyone had been assured. And then it was delayed. Messaging that was a major challenge. Getting folks to comply in the early days, before we had a vaccine. How do you get your public to begin to wash their hands and stay home when they're sick and use their sleeve to cough into? Communications, again, is just one of the things that was really needed to be able to overcome those challenges. Convincing the governor to stockpile, to mobilize resources.    At that time, we were talking about antivirals, and you have a strategic national stockpile on the national level, but there was opportunity for states to stockpile further for their amounts for their population. And I can remember having the conversation with the governor about mobilizing resources; in my case, a conservative state. But that happened, because at that time, that's what we felt like was one of the better things to do. School closings, oh my, that was a real challenge because there was, quite frankly, there was some delay in getting the guidance out from CDC, and you had all the school superintendents, I can remember there being some pretty tense moments, especially when in some jurisdictions there were reports of either teachers or students that were quite ill or deaths that were occurring during H1N1. There were challenges on multiple levels. And coordinating between the local communities, the state, and the federal is obviously something that needs to happen, but it happens many times behind closed doors.    I can remember one time with the school closings I had to make sure that the local health officer and the local school superintendent was aligned with the state and the governor and so forth. And we had multiple phone calls, for hours, the evening before, the morning before, to gain consensus. But when we all stood up shoulder to shoulder at the press conference, about two o'clock in the afternoon the next day, we were all aligned. And we got so much praise from the public because everyone saw that we were all on the same page and giving the same message.    Tilson:              I wasn't about to step on that message. What a great story. Judy, translate that into leadership lessons that you've learned. That, as you were a leader, you were thrust into a real leadership position. For future state health officers that are going to be facing these same sorts of challenges, what leadership skills do you bring to that leadership?    Monroe:           I think the leadership skills, we could talk a long time about leadership skills because there are many. I think in being a good leader, part of it is reading the room or reading the situation, because there are times that humility is what is needed, there are other times when folks really need to see someone stand up and be a really strong leader, grounded in the data, and have a forceful message and using the bully pulpit. As state health officer there were times, especially during H1N1 or other outbreaks, when I would go in front of the cameras or go in front of audiences and I was very clear in my message. Other times, you need to step back, listen, and again have that humility.    Being able to lead different groups is quite a challenge for a state health officer, because in many ways you're trying to influence and convince your governor or your legislators of certain things that need to be done. And the next day you may find yourself in a small community meeting in a small town, in a rural community, that type of thing, so I do think it takes some flexibility. And reading the room would be one of the things. Good listening, good communication, strong communication so that it's very clear. Willingness to learn, I think that's a strong characteristic. A characteristic of a strong leader is being always willing to learn because there's always something new coming around. Even though you may have thought you had the answer, new data or new information may come in that actually there's maybe a better way to go about it.    Tilson:              I think I know too much about you.    Monroe:           [Laughs]    Tilson:              But I'd like you to talk out loud about integrity, trustworthiness.    Monroe:           I think as a leader trust is fundamental. When you are authentic and people trust you, you do get a lot more done. I found myself many times almost being surprised at some of the success, and what would come back to me would be messages that, no, the legislators trusted me, therefore they would allocate funding for whatever I was asking for or they would...it was helpful for passing certain laws, or the trust of the governor, the trust of the communities, the academic communities. That's the other thing as a state health officer, you need to have that trust at so many levels and so many audiences that are looking at you through a different lens. So, having integrity and building trust is key to the success of a state health officer.    Tilson:              You hadn't had prior experience in government when you started off as a state health officer, so let's scroll back to day one. What do you wish you had known on day one that you had to learn the hard way?    Monroe:           I did not have any experience in government prior to becoming state health officer. In fact, when the governor asked me would I consider being the state health officer, I had to go quickly and do some reading and talking to people to find out exactly what a state health officer did. I mean, what in fact was the job of the state health officer? I think coming in it would have been nice to have actually had a better and deeper understanding of the political process and just government in general. I had a basic understanding, but I certainly learned by fire very quickly.    Luckily, I also had legislators that took me under their wing. They made it clear to me that I was now in politics [Laughs] and that they were there to help and guide me, which I think actually paved the way for even more success because I was willing to be a good student of those that wanted to teach me.    Tilson:              Were there other aspects of the onboarding that were particularly useful to you or that you wish people had done but didn't? What do we need to tell people who are bringing new health officers on board about how to increase their likelihood of success?    Monroe:           When I think about my onboarding, coming in without having that prior experience in state government or even at the local level, I just really valued the outreach that I had from ASTHO. I think that mentoring relationship just is invaluable. I had been told by the individual that I came in behind, the person that I succeeded told me, \"Make sure you get involved with ASTHO very quickly.\" And that was the best advice, probably, I was given on day one in the job. I can remember thinking that the current state health officers that I started to meet in meetings or that I would hear on telephones, I thought, these people are brilliant, unbelievable the knowledge that they seem to have, because I was so new to the whole aspect of being a state health officer. But people reached to me. I had private phone calls. I had visits. That was probably the most valuable because, to be honest with you, there were very few people in the state that could help me—former state health officers. Some of them had approached the job differently than I wanted to. And so that was the other thing, too, I think knowing yourself. And I would put that high on the list for a leader, above all, know thyself and follow your own North Star, just be authentic. In doing that I started seeking out other state health officers that I would see characteristics in them that I wanted to be like or that I could see some of myself in.    The other things I looked for were, what were the priorities for my governor, what were the priorities for my state legislature? And then looking to state health officers that maybe had advanced those issues. Who'd been successful and how did they do it? I was very curious about the how. The other thing I would tell you is the State Health Leadership Initiative, that week of being with state health officers and being able to be in a learning environment with my new state health officers, my colleagues, was also an invaluable early experience that just served me...it serves me still today. I think back to the lessons I learned that week.    Tilson:              One of the things we're looking at in our study is the high turnover of state health officers, too many leaving too fast. Talk about your departure and what the experience with that was. You left fairly precipitously because you got a great job offer.    Monroe:           I did.    Tilson:              What did that do to the agency?    Monroe:           When I started as state health officer, I was there for five years which was a long enough tenure that I had really put my mark on both the State Health Department as well as the public health system in the state of Indiana. When I got this job offer and left to go to CDC, it was pretty abrupt. Surprised the governor, surprised the public health community that I was often running. With that I had put together certain structures that, after I left, some of those fell apart, quite frankly. Now there are some things I'd put in place that are still there today, and people remind me and that's celebrated. The one thing in government that is a bit distressing for me is that you don't really have the advantage to select your successor, so succession planning within the state is challenging in government. There were, especially for local public health departments, I think they felt my departure pretty acutely, and I heard that a lot. Part of that was just someone coming in behind me took a different approach, and I don't know that they felt as valued or heard the way they did when I established my relationship with them.    Tilson:              Advise new health officers about how to protect their agencies against the pain of turnover, in case they don't last five years.    Monroe:           Again, I think when new health officers come in they do need to take some time, and do it quickly, to listen to the various stakeholders, to find out what was valued and what worked, and to see if it's still politically viable. Because if you come out too quickly with messages to, say, your local health department, the local health officers, or it could be to the academic community or so forth, you may find yourself having a troubled start because the person that preceded you may have put some things in place that have a high value. Now, you need to make them your own. And that's one of the challenges of the job, you want to put your own stamp on things and make them your own, but don't throw the baby out with the bath water. That happened for a couple of things after I left, which I did hear quite a bit about.    Tilson:              Can you insulate the agency against that kind of turnover trauma? Particularly for the short tenure health officers, the ones who only make it two and half years, say, what can they do?    Monroe:           That's a great question and it's one that I think we all need to give a lot of thought to. Part of that can be done by having a strong executive team, I think, at the health department. I think the deputies play an incredible role, as well as the others that might be on that executive team. Anyone that may come in and know that they're going to be there for a short time, and a longer term as well, but especially the short term, they do need to be conscious of that, that there needs to be some sustainability and buffering the agency against the trauma of them leaving. I think I'd turn to my deputies.    Tilson:              I don't want to miss the chance to talk particularly with you about the relationship between state health officers and the CDC. Help our SHO's to understand how to use the CDC, and maybe vice versa.    Monroe:           First of all, when I came in as state health officer, to be honest, I was pretty wowed that I got to work with CDC. It's such a great brand, both domestically and worldwide. I had been a practicing physician, so coming in it was like, this is really cool, I get to work to CDC. As I started to work with the CDC, though, I found that I wasn't always getting what I needed directly from CDC. In my case, I was asked to go to CDC to establish an office of state, tribal, local and territorial support, OSTLTS. That is your home at CDC. Any new state health officer, not only would I advise quickly getting involved with ASTHO but you want to be known by OSTLTS also, because OSTLTS is the inside game at CDC, and we really built that office to be the home for state health officers, as well as locals that come in, as well, but especially for the state health officers. That means establishing a relationship with the director, currently José Montero, but there's a tremendous staff there.    What we did when state health officers would have a particular need, whether that was trying to advance policy or whether that was data needs or whether that was just they needed the experience or they needed...maybe things weren't working as well in a particular program that they needed some support, they can call OSTLTS and OSTLTS will help navigate either connecting them to the right people, problem solving, what have you. We did a number of things on behalf of the state health officers. It's a really important relationship. State health officers and CDC need one another, and they need to learn, they need to continually learn from one another, as well.    Tilson:              You bring another... You have so many things to bring to this table. We don't have all day but just in the next exchange, please think out loud about the relationship between public health and private medicine.    Monroe:           The relationship between public health and private medicine is one that quite frankly has intrigued me my entire career. I think we miss opportunities all the time with private medicine and public health. That's, when we think about the leadership of state health officers and what they can bring to the table, is forging a strong relationship with the Hospital Association at the state level and then with CEO's.    A quick story. I was state health officer. Had been state health officer in Indiana two or three years by this point. There was something I had a question about, and I started calling CEO's of hospitals. And I called one particular CEO in a moderate-sized town who'd been the CEO of this hospital for 30 years, and he said, \"This is the first time a state health officer has ever picked up the phone to talk to me,\" and he was thrilled. He was thrilled with the call. We ended up probably talking an hour. We covered all kinds of issues. He became one of the greatest advocates for public health during my tenure and after. Picking up the phone, talking at that top leader, the state health officer, the beauty—and I love this part of the job—was that quite frankly anybody would take my phone call. CEO's of companies, CEO's of hospitals, it didn't matter, as the state health officer, folks would take your call because they knew you worked for the governor and they had an interest in that. Use that wisely because we need to forge more relationships. And then if it's starting at the top, then you can engage the local health officer to work with the local hospitals and with the medical staff.    One of the things I did as state health officer is I started very strategic communications out to all licenses professionals. And it would depend, sometimes it would only be to the physicians, sometimes it would be to the pharmacists, nurses and so forth. Some other state health officers have followed suit with that. That's another bully pulpit opportunity that state health officers have. If new state health officers are coming into the job and that's not established in your state, seize that opportunity, but be strategic about it. You don't want to overwhelm the practicing physicians with communications.    Actually, we started a medicine and public health day. It was the Indiana...it was the commissioner's public health and medicine day. I actually got the residency programs to close down for the day, have the faculty cover their patients, and we'd bring residents in to highlight all the things that had happened in public health in Indiana for a year. Looking back in the year before, what were the issues that medicine should care about, that public health had been managing, and those kinds of things. It was a really robust and fun day. So, you can be creative with it.    Tilson:              Let's do one more of those exchanges. Let's now blue sky. Public health is an extraordinary field. Things are changing rapidly. What do you think the greatest opportunity looking forward is? Where are we going here that public health needs to embrace?    Monroe:           If I get blue sky about where public health needs to go, I'm going to put on my current hat, because I'm now president and CEO of the CDC Foundation, and I've spent the last year and a half working with large companies and large associations that I'd never even heard of before, that are in various industries. When I think about the entrepreneurs and the new technologies and all of these things that are emerging, we need those folks to be champions of public health. We need to be more innovative in public health, and to do that we need to talk to people who are innovators. I will tell you, there are communities out there that think differently, that would serve us well both ways. So, I'm beginning to do some of that in my role at the foundation, and I think there's huge opportunity there.    Tilson:              And then finally, speak to the alumni. What can ASTHLO alumni do to help public health?    Monroe:           ASTHO alumni are, what a treasure. They have gone... Life after being a state health officer takes so many shapes and forms. I've talked to fellow alumni that have gone into pharmaceutical companies and philanthropy and various businesses, it's very cool. I think the alumni need to be a strong force. They can be a voice, they've got the freedom now. Most of them have the freedom to speak up. They can write op-eds, they can be on the Hill, they can get with their legislators in their own state or jurisdictions to help carry the message. They can be incredible mentors to those coming up through the ranks. I would call on all alumni to be incredible active and use their talents and their experience to advance public health.    Tilson:              Unbelievable how quickly the time flies, Judy. You also have the bully pulpit here with the microphone and the camera.    Monroe:           [Laughs]    Tilson:              Is there anything you want to say to ASTHO or your fellow state health officers?    Monroe:           Just a huge thank you. I just give a huge shout out to ASTHO for all that they've done for 75 years. They've been quite a force, and they need to continue to grow and even be stronger. My colleagues across the field at all levels, I've had such a privilege of meeting so many remarkable people, and it's just a big thank you from me.    Tilson:              Judy Monroe meets remarkable people because she is a remarkable person. Thank you so much for doing this for us, Judy. Appreciate your coming.     ### Mary Selecky  Washington, 1998-2013 Mary Selecky served as Washington State secretary of health from 1998 until April 2013. As one of the nation’s longest serving secretaries of health, she served three governors – Locke, Gregoire and Inslee. Prior to that, she worked in local government in one of Washington’s most rural areas – Ferry, Pend Oreille and Stevens Counties - where she had been a local public health administrator for 20 years.  Description of the video:  Hugh:     Hello and welcome to this set of interviews. I'm having a great conversation with you, Mary Selecky, former state health officer for the State of Washington. We'll have lots to talk about, but I wanted to first of all say that this is a study of the factors of success for state health officers, sponsored by the de Beaumont Foundation, supported by the Association of State Territorial Health Officials and run by the Fairbanks School of Public Health in Indianapolis. Thanks for joining me.    Mary:     Oh, you're welcome.    Hugh:     Mary, you know that our focus is on success of state health officers. I'd love to hear your definition of success from your own experience and maybe a few of the factors that you think made you successful.    Mary:     Approaching that term \"success\" is very interesting when you're at the state level because, depending on the issue, it might be a very quick issue with a quick turnaround, and what you're hoping is that you're really going to have a longer-term impact on the population in your state. As I think about success it's always wonderful to have hindsight and to look back and say, what was that thing that really made a difference? I was very fortunate that I got to serve multiple governors for a number of years. And a big issue for us was tobacco prevention, for example, but it took 10 years to see what difference that made. We did get a smoke-free state, and you see that pretty quickly. You do get some numbers that tell you kids are starting to smoke less. But you're looking for, what's that health impact? And as we got more adults to quit we actually saw a reduction in respiratory diseases showing up in hospitals. Success can look like an epidemiology curve. Success can be a good headline that thanks the department of health for doing something very well. Success can also be an okay nod from a governor giving you an attagirl or an attaboy for following through on something that was very tough.    Hugh:     You know, it doesn't matter how you define it. You also know yourself and know what factors you brought to the job that made you a success. Talk a little bit about what made you successful.    Mary:     When I became a state health official I had had 20 years of experience at the local level. Not everybody gets that opportunity. I felt like, at least I knew the players, I knew the issues from the local level, and I was able to take that kind of local voice to the state level. However, the state is a very different arena than working in local public health. I don't care what state you're in. Because when you do that change to the state level you have to have a perspective that's much broader, you've got to look at the issues from many angles. Now, all of a sudden, you're the regulator instead of the regulated. Coming to the job of state health official gave me a little bit of a start at least in knowing the issues but how complex they were I didn't have a clue. That was a major learning curve for me in my first year.    Hugh:     I think you actually answered the third question while you were answering the second but let me just drill down. Is there something you wish you had known on your first day, that you didn't, that maybe we could have given you?    Mary:     When I walked into state service I thought I understood state government. I did not. And I do have to credit the leadership institute that we had at the time, and I was in the inaugural class, about talking about much broader policy issues, about looking at how we would look at it from a different set of lenses. Initially, I was feeling very good about taking my local public health experience to the state level, but my learning curve about looking at it from a state policy level, a state system level, and a state impact level was a very high learning curve.    Hugh:     I wish we had time to talk about the dirty dozen. Maybe a little later we can do that. To focus on the most important challenge, give me just one most important challenge you faced in your time as state health officer, and then talk about leadership lessons learned and leadership you had to exert.    Mary:     Challenges come in many different shapes and forms. One of those challenges is a very large-print headline in the very important newspaper of the biggest town talking about the department of health as licensed to harm. I happened to have the responsibility to license all the state health officials, and there were some things that we didn't do well. That's a very humbling pill to swallow. To make sure that you've prepared the governor for that kind of headline was going to come, and hope that the governor would stick with you to go through the improvements that were needed. So that kind of challenge of managing the media, making sure the staff didn't lose their confidence in what we were doing, and then leading through the improvements that needed to go on was a huge, huge challenge.    Another one of the kinds of challenges is certainly everything that we faced after September 11th, 2001. We were not prepared as a system, and we will be better prepared every day that we work on it. But the coming together of state health officials across this nation and learning from our colleagues in the eastern states and Washington DC. Even though Seattle and Washington state were far away, we needed to be ready for things that we couldn't anticipate. Whether it was the H1N1 flu epidemic, we used the skills that we learned in preparedness. Whether it was when Fukushima blew up in Japan, and while it didn't impact the United States, the amount of fear that people had about radiation impacting them used every skill of risk communication, giving the public the kind of information they needed so that they would feel comfortable in trusting you that their health was okay. Those are challenges that are not easily defined, and you've got to have skill building and leadership building prior to that, to get through those challenges.    Hugh:     I wasn't about to step on that line. Great. Even longstanding health officers eventually have to leave. How did you prepare your agency for your departure and what was the impact of your departure, do you think?    Mary:     I had some very interesting experiences as state health official who'd been in the office through three governors. And probably the toughest learning was how you transitioned from one governor to another governor, not knowing the outcome of an election, not knowing whether the new governor would ask you to stay, whether you would fit in a new administration or the new administration would be taking some direction that perhaps you didn't agree with. Those are all unknowns and only you can share them with another state health official because they go through the same kind of path. Nobody else can help prepare you. The best advice I got was the way you keep your job is to do your job. That's one.    Two, don't count on anybody's word saying, \"Oh, they'll keep you,\" or, \"Oh, you'll be able to stay,\" until it's that governor who says to you, \"I want you.\" I think that's an important piece, but also preparing the agency for a transition that could come. Being prepared for someone who's new going to come in. Even though it might be you, or you want it to be you, it still is a new administration. And I think that's an important thing for those of us who have been there through a governor’s term.    Now, there are also times I think when folks have to prepare for an issue they didn't expect, the headline they didn't expect, and a governor saying farewell. And that's a sudden departure. None of us ever want to wish that on anybody. For me personally, I was looking at a time in my life, I was approaching 66, is this a time for me to commit four more years to a governor? And if I couldn't commit four, why would I? No, I have no idea what his plan might have been, the new governor, but I needed to prepare the agency for saying farewell and that you'll be in good hands with the next leader. And indeed, I was very lucky that my successor was just prepared like he was for the job.    Hugh:     Help us with some messaging for the short-term precipitous to partners and how they can prepare their agency for the unexpected. A lot of them are coming in and won't be here more than two and half years, as we now know.    Mary:     Right. A number of my colleagues were not as fortunate as I to serve, and maybe they didn't want to serve, as long. What we needed to as state health officials was support one another. By supporting one another you also could remind them that when they're going through the bad time, do they have a deputy who's ready to step in? Do they have an administrative team that would be able to make sure that the agency kept humming, that their senior leadership in their agency was ready to handle situations when you weren't there? Because none of us can predict whether we're there tomorrow or not by either life or by our appointment by our governor. Your job could be gone at any time. Our job was really to build a foundation for which the agency could succeed, not just us.    Hugh:     Mary your experience of course is like mine. You were a local health officer and a successful local health officer before you became state health officer. Help our SHO's, particularly those who weren't local health officers, to understand the unique relationship between the state and localities.    Mary:     We have 50 states, the territories and Washington DC as members of this very exclusive club called ASTHO. One of the things that quickly I learned was to listen to my fellow colleagues about how different their state might have been than mine and not anticipate that it was the same. Every state, regardless of whether you are a state that runs the local health departments, whether you're in a state that has local health departments with law jurisdiction that gives them the authority at the local level, you have to have a relationship. And relationships are everything, all else is derivative. As a new state health official, paying attention to what's going on in the far corners of your state, listening to those folks who are in the communities, is as important as listening to the governor, the governor's policy person, the legislature, because without those relationships at the community level you can't get much done.    Hugh:     One of the most exciting things about being a former state health officer is we don't stop serving. You see these opportunities now emerging for us going forward. Can you put your finger on what you think is the greatest opportunity for public health in the near future, where we might be able to put our stake?    Mary:     Healthcare in these days is changing so rapidly. I know as a long-term public health professional when I hear a hospital system talking about population health, on the one hand you want to say, \"Excuse me, I've been doing that for a long time,\" on the other hand you have to appreciate, how are they looking at population health? Is it in a way that enhances the public's health overall or the population that they serve that isn't the population overall? I think those of us who are looking at communities and saying, okay, there are healthcare providers, there are hospitals, there are local docs offices, the community clinics, whatever the case is; do they have the eyes of the whole community? Because public health has to have the eyes of the whole community. As we look forward it's important for us to have a voice in those tables, to be at those tables, and to serve when you're done being a state health official in your community in some kind of capacity.    Hugh:     You have the eyes and the ears of the public health and state health leadership on tape right now Mary. What do you want to say to them as sort of a final bon mot?    Mary:     Your opportunity when you're a state health official is something that not very many people share, so reach out to your colleagues, number one. Create whatever friendships it is that you will create but use them to help you through the tough times. Secondly, relationships are everything, all else is derivative. Whether it's with your governor's staff, whether it's with the legislature and the legislative staff, or the congressional staff in Washington DC, we have to have those relationships in order to have the policy discussions that we need to have when we're the state health official. And the other one is to pay attention to your workforce. Give them a good place to work. If they're not in great buildings, help them get into great buildings. If they need infrastructure updates, whether it's your IT department or whatever the case is, give them good tools to work with. But also provide the kind of leadership that helps them thrive and create a learning opportunity for them all the time and be a lifelong learning organization.    Hugh:     Mary Selecky born a leader but never stops learning. And Mary, you never stop teaching me either. Thank you so much for doing this.    Mary:     Oh, you're welcome. And good luck with this project.      Return to: SHO-CASE homepage | SHO-CASE videos "

    "body": "  ## Health Services Management Student and Alumna Work Together for Nonprofit Internship  Only five years after graduating from the Health Services Management (HSM) program at IU Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health, alumna Kelsey Singleton has already made a commitment to students following in her footsteps.  In her position as development manager of operations at Cancer Support Community, Kelsey (right) hosts interns from the HSM program year-round, like Te'Nia Jackson (left), an HSM student currently interning with CSC.  “Having had such a wonderful experience while in the HSM program, I wanted to give back in the most beneficial way I could,” Kelsey said. “That is why hiring fellow HSM students to intern is so important to me. I know I wouldn’t be where I am today if someone hadn’t taken a chance on me and hired me for my first internship.”  Kelsey started as an intern for CSC in 2014, working there part time, and eventually accepted a full time position in 2015.  “It is no secret that I am passionate about the work I do,” she said. “I truly enjoy having a career in the nonprofit field, allowing me to make a difference through the work I do each day. I know how meaningful my work is to me, and I love giving students the opportunity to find a job they are just as passionate about.”  Annually, Kelsey oversees anywhere from three to six interns depending on the projects and events CSC has. Every fall, she hires two interns to work with her on a silent auction for the organization’s largest annual fundraiser, Laughing Matters. She also looks throughout the year for students interested in learning about fundraising and nonprofit event planning to help with fun and exciting new events.  The best thing about hosting interns is the chance to encourage students to see that there is “a whole other world to healthcare outside of a hospital setting,” Kelsey said. “Having been a student myself in the HSM program at IUPUI, I know how hard it can be to figure out what you want to do post-graduation.”  Kelsey believes that rarely in life, aside from internships, do you get the opportunity to try out a job before you commit to it. Additionally, interning allows students to get a better understanding of the jobs available, as well as learn what characteristics they enjoy (or do not enjoy) about a particular work environment.  “I love being able to host students for a few months at a time, giving them a chance to try out a position that just might be exactly what they’re looking for,” said Kelsey, who may have accomplished that with one of her recent interns, Te’Nia Jackson.  Te’Nia, a senior in the Health Services Management program, is currently a special events intern under Kelsey’s supervision at Cancer Support Community. Te’Nia took the initiative one day to visit CSC to talk with Kelsey about her experience and perspective about working for a nonprofit organization. Encouraged by their conversation, Te’Nia applied and interviewed for the position. Having interned with CSC for several months, she now believes working at a nonprofit organization might be a great next step for her.  “I wanted to do something to not only get my foot in the door but to gain that hands-on experience in the field,” Te’Nia said. “Prior to this internship, I had not worked in a healthcare related field, and I wanted to change that.”  As the special events intern, Te’Nia reaches out to businesses to secure funding for CSC’s silent auction. She prepares and organizes the paperwork for items donated, organizes the items into appealing packages, oversees the preparation and setup for the silent auction event, and handles the day-of logistics. In many ways, she believes the HSM program has prepared her for what she does in this position.  “I have taken classes about how to interact with people and how to represent myself and my organization well,” she said. “These are all things I have taken with me into my internship. Also, with this internship, some of the ideas that I have or the documents I have created, have come from things that I have learned in my classes.”  With all that Te’Nia is learning, she credits much of her success to having “an amazing leader like Kelsey.”  “Interning with Kelsey has helped me see exactly how beneficial organizations like CSC are to the community and the people they serve,” Te’Nia said. “An important goal with my long-term job is that I want to see how I am benefitting my community and people.”  Cancer Support Community is always accepting applications for both development & fundraising interns, as well as program interns. If you are interested in completing or hosting an internship for HSM students, please reach out to Sarah Johnson at shm@indiana.edu . "

    "body": "  ## Alumni Career Profile: Josh Burger  BS in Health Services Management, 2010 MHA 2015 Current Title: Provider Data Manager Current Employer: MDwise  Josh’s decision to major in Health Services Management was, in his words, plain and simple – he wanted to be a leader in the healthcare industry. “I wanted to have an impact on the health of my community, but knew my strengths were not on the medical side. Regardless if you have direct contact with patients or not, you can have a significant impact in this industry.”  He enrolled in the Bachelor of Science in Health Services Management (BSHSM) program at the Fairbanks School of Public Health, and became a student both inside the classroom and out. Having various internships and being in the field helped him apply what he saw firsthand (on the job) to the classroom and coursework and vice versa.  “I interned at multiple organizations. The first was a summer internship at a hospital, where I mostly shadowed leaders. The second internship was at IU Medical Group that started as a part-time unpaid internship, but eventually led me to my first job.”  My education played a huge part in helping me obtain my first job, and each step up in my career was a progression that allowed me to build on what I had learned from the previous role.  Josh’s first job after graduating was with IU Medical Group Primary Care as a Provider Relations Assistant, an entry level role that focused on data entry. He had multiple advancements with this company and then at Eskenazi Health before finding himself at MDwise, where he works today as a Provider Data Manager, leading the teams that maintain the integrity of provider information in their systems. Josh’s responsibilities have a direct impact on the online provider directory that is used by patients and that feeds claims to the vendor’s system for appropriate payment..  “I found myself using some of the core context of what I learned in the classroom such as strategic planning and thinking, LEAN six sigma principles and project management, and basic leadership principles from organizational leadership courses.”  When Josh first began the BSHSM program, he wanted to one day hold an executive position within a hospital or large healthcare organization. Since then his goals have evolved.  “One can have a major impact on a community that way, but as I’ve been exposed directly to the challenges we face as healthcare leaders, my goals shifted.”  Josh now wants to be a driving leader that influences health policy at a local, state, and perhaps even federal level.  “I’m passionate in believing that everyone should have healthcare that is both adequate and affordable. Mostly, I think my education was a driving factor that intrigued me to stay up to date with health policy – which is ever-changing.”  Josh decided to pursue his Masters in Health Administration and believes his BSHSM education was integral in preparing him for success in his graduate studies.

    "body": "  ## IUPUI ECHO Center  Description of the video:  Project ECHO is a performance optimizer. Think of it as a high speed internet connection for the healthcare system. It spreads new medical knowledge throughout the healthcare system from university medical centers and other specialty sites to the front lines of community care. Rather than information flowing in one direction, community providers learn from specialists, they learn from each other, and specialists learn from community providers as new best practices emerge. Under ECHO, community providers use video technology to participate in guided practice with specialist mentors.  They acquire new skills that allow them to treat patients that they otherwise would have referred out. Patients with complex chronic conditions get high quality care where they live from providers they know. No waiting months to see a specialist. No long drives back and forth to get critical care. ECHO exponentially increases access to specialty care by moving knowledge instead of moving patients. Suffering and pain are reduced, and lives are improved and even saved. Project ECHO - changing the world fast.  Project ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) uses technology to leverage scarce resources, reduces disparities in care by demonopolizing knowledge, provides case-based learning to enhance mastery of complex information and increase impact, and uses web-based databases to monitor outcomes.  This is a cost-free partnership between local primary care providers and the Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health (RMFSPH) to improve access to high-quality treatment for common, complex, and chronic diseases in Indiana. With support from interdisciplinary teams of medical specialists based in Indianapolis, the IUPUI ECHO Center uses technology to facilitate mentoring and knowledge sharing, enabling clinicians to provide best-practice care locally.

Fairbanks School of Public Health (IU FSPH). She received her MPH in Social and Behavioral Sciences in 2010 and her PhD in Health Policy and Management in 2020. Following her doctoral program, Dr. Hilts completed an NIH-NCI T32 Postdoctoral Fellowship in Behavioral Oncology with the IU School of Nursing, IU Simon Comprehensive Cancer Center, and the Purdue College of Pharmacy. Prior to beginning her academic career, she spent eight years working with the Marion County Public Health Department in Indianapolis, IN, seven of which were spent in the tobacco control program. Dr. Hilts draws on her practice experience and connections to support her research and teaching.   ### Research Interests  Dr. Hilts’ research involves assessing how policies and systems-level strategies influence organizational practices to improve scalable, sustainable implementation of evidence-based interventions, such as tobacco dependence treatment, within and across healthcare settings. Her current work leverages her training as a health services researcher and background in tobacco control to support efforts to train and assist pharmacists in integrating tobacco cessation services (including prescribing) into practice. Dr. Hilts is particularly interested in how expanded access to these services in pharmacy settings can help address gaps in care among traditionally underserved groups, such as rural populations.

    "body": "  ## Mentorship Flourishes  One of the greatest compliments students provide about their experience as a Masters of Health Administration student is often of the mentors they meet while enrolled in the program.  As a student, Patricia Nguyen (MHA, MBA ‘14) presented a capstone business case to a board of executives that included Elizabeth Walker (MHA, JD ’99).  After the class, the two connected and have maintained a mentorship throughout the years that they both now describe as a true friendship.  Throughout their friendship, they have encouraged each other to seek new challenges and perspectives in their careers. Walker recognizes that the healthcare landscape can change rapidly and that interacting with young professionals provides her with perspectives she may not see every day. Not only does she benefit personally from several mentors, but she also believes mentoring students is a way for her to pay that kindness forward.  Walker encourages students who are seeking mentors to show up when invited to professional networking events and to understand that these relationships build over time.  Reflecting on her experience with Elizabeth, Nguyen encourages students to recognize what questions they have about their career trajectory and to seek out advice from individuals who can help answer those questions.  She states that the MHA program is terrific at arranging opportunities for students to meet professionals and that students should not be discouraged if they do not bond with a mentor right away.  What is most important, she explains, is that students find individuals who can challenge them to think differently about their careers.  Now, Nguyen is mentoring students in the MHA program. She and Walker view professional networking and mentoring relationships as a spiderweb. Having many connections creates a wide network that evolves with your career.  If you are interested in serving as a mentor to an MHA student, contact Dr. Ann Johnston, MHA Program Director, at annljohn@iu.edu . "

    "body": "  ## Student Spotlight: Beth Brouwer Finds Passion at the Intersection of Healthcare and Law  Beth Brouwer is a recent graduate of the BS in health services management program at the IU Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health, and has already established a solid foundation for a career in healthcare management.  With a passion for both healthcare and law, many of Beth’s pursuits inside and outside the classroom have centered around human rights issues, such as healthcare access and quality.  She is currently working with the legislature at the Indiana Senate, her first full-time opportunity since graduating. In this role, Beth primarily serves as a liaison for the Indiana Senate Minority Leader, conducting research on pending legislation and past legal cases. She also analyzes the Indiana code and uses her findings to offer solutions for future policy.  “My role is heavily research-based, with an emphasis on analysis and critical thinking,” Beth said. “In addition to research, I frequently meet with lobbyists to discuss legislation predominantly focusing on health and public policy.”  During the 2019 legislative session, Beth staffed the Senate Health and Provider Services committee – a move she felt prepared for.  “Over 100 bills were debated over a variety of topics I studied as a health services management student,” she said. “My background in healthcare services was a huge advantage to my understanding of this legislation.”  One of Beth’s favorite classes at IUPUI was Health Policy offered by FSPH, where she first became fascinated with policy and how it affects every aspect of healthcare, from reimbursement to licensure. The course, however, was one of several opportunities she took advantage of.  “IUPUI gave me the opportunity to have a variety of experiences in the healthcare industry, including work at the [Indiana] State Department of Health and the IU Center for Public Health Practice at FSPH,” she said. “These experiences led me to my current position and have opened doors for future professional endeavors.”  In 2018, Beth participated in a study abroad program that consisted of traveling to 10 countries in four months and said the trip confirmed her career goals.  “I was able to experience personal growth and explore my passion for health policy through the lens of other cultures,” Beth said. “This experience reinforced my desire to work in healthcare and human rights in the future. As a first-generation college student, study abroad opportunities are often not in the cards for students like myself. One of my proudest accomplishments was being able to work and be awarded scholarships in order to afford this once in a lifetime opportunity.”  Beth plans to continue working with the Indiana Senate throughout the summer. Her long term goals include attending law school and influencing health policy on a larger scale.  “The intersection of law and healthcare has been a passion of mine throughout my college career,” she said. “In 10 years, I see myself working on health policy matters on a federal or international level.”  Beth has been a model student at IUPUI, as well as in the broader community. This year, she was named a 500 Festival Princess for being one of Indiana’s most civic-minded, academically driven young women.  “The 500 Festival Princess Program has given me a platform to discuss issues important to me such as healthcare and education access. I have also been able to connect with children and young girls, which is another passion of mine. In addition to community outreach, this scholarship program has allowed me to further my professional development and enhance my leadership skills. I can't think of a better way to conclude my college career than being able to give back to the community that has provided me with so many amazing opportunities.” "

    "body": "  ## Center for Health Policy Director to Study Electronic Sharing of Health Information in Primary Care  The federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality recently awarded a large grant to Joshua Vest, PhD, Associate Professor of Health Policy and Management and Director of the Center for Health Policy, to study the use and effectiveness of alternative methods of electronically sharing information in primary care settings. This will be the first study of its kind.  The United States has invested billions on interoperable health information technologies, but there is very little evidence of health information exchange's effects on utilization and on how it is used in primary care practice, said Vest.  According to Vest, providers have access to two different health information exchange approaches to meet their information needs.  One approach is referred to as \"pull,\" which allows providers to query communitywide, longitudinal patient records. A second approach is \"push,\" where key information, such as test results, is automatically delivered to providers.  There is a lack of evidence of the effectiveness of either the \"push\" or \"pull\" approach, Vest said. \"Furthermore, which approach to sharing information best fits into primary care is unknown,\" he said.  One objective of the study is to determine whether primary care providers use \"push\" and \"pull\" as complementary or alternative approaches to health information exchange, Vest said. The study will leverage a novel data set of individual provider and staff behavior tracked within an electronic health record system, combined with detailed measures of \"push\" and \"pull\" health information exchange usage.  \"These data furnish a complete, detailed temporal sequence of providers' behavior, revealing how each approach to health information exchange is used during a patient visit,\" Vest said.  The study will also quantify the effect of \"push\" and \"pull\" health information exchange on potentially avoidable health care utilization, he said.  The Center for Health Policy works closely with local health systems and Indiana state agencies to address the health issues in our state and beyond. "

Description of the video:  Study Abroad Video Transcript  Micaela Gaviola, sophomore, Fairbanks School of Public Health: Studying abroad has been my favorite memory in my college career so far, which I know hasn’t been long.  Monica Deck, Senior, Fairbanks School of Public Health: Being in such aninternational city was just incredibly eye opening.  Thomas Duszynski, Dir. Epidemiology Education, Fairbanks School of Public Health: You should really study abroad. If this is an opportunity you should take it because you never know when that opportunity is gonna come along again.  Micaela: The experience that you get outside of classroom, the diversity, the culture you get to immerse yourself that is really truly important to like creating identity.  Thomas: London is like what I would call one of the public health centers of the universe. This is where a lot of public health started. If you have that passion for public health, if you like participating in public health, if you like doing public health, why not see where some of this all began and how it all came about?  Monica: Going to London and being able to see all of these different places and historical artifacts in person it solidified of the necessity of public health. We did a kind of walking tour of the soho area, which was the focus of the book The Ghost Map.  Thomas: The story of the 1854 London cholera outbreak that claimed as many as 500 lives a day, the students actually get to walk that area where this occurred and where the now father and mother of epidemiology John Snow hypothesized about the fact that it was coming from the water. To read about it in a book, in a textbook and then to actually walk that area is pretty amazing.  Monica: I wanted to see the National Health Services in action. There was something to be learned, classroom sections, things I would not necessarily had access to had I traveled on my own. And also it was really fun to travel with my fellow students.  Micaela: It’s worth it - all of the effort going into making your application the cost, the independence and the new world prospective – it is worth so much more.     ### Apply for an FSPH study abroad scholarship  The Fairbanks School of Public Health Study Abroad Scholarship provides up to four $500 scholarships to support FSPH students enrolled in approved, credit-bearing FSPH study abroad programs overseas.

    "body": "  ## Become a knowledgeable and innovative leader  This unique and exciting doctoral program prepares you to be a knowledgeable and innovative leader capable of effectively addressing the world’s most challenging and complex public health problems.  The three-year, cohort-based distance program is designed for diverse professionals working full time in field-based settings around the world. Classes are delivered in real time via internet video. You will meet face-to-face for a few days three times per year in years one and two of the program.   ### Apply now  See the admissions criteria and apply »   ### Questions?  Let us know your interests and how we can help you »  Most in-person sessions take place in Indianapolis, Indiana; other times, the program meets elsewhere in the U.S. or around the world. You will complete dissertations or field-based, culminating projects in year three.  Some international scholars admitted into the DrPH program may need visas to enter the United States for the three short residential visits in years one and two. For those who require it, the Office of International Affairs assists with issuance of a form I-20 required for an F-1 visa.  [Office of International Affairs](http://international.iupui.edu/visas/f1-students/index.html)   ### Annual lecture  The DrPH program hosts an annual lecture to launch the executive visit in August. Previously, the program welcomed Dr. Ken Coburn who presented \"Advanced Preventive Care for chronically ill older adults; a 19-year innovation story told in reverse order.\"   ### Who will benefit from this program?  The target audience is mid- to senior-level professionals anywhere in the world working full time in organizations in which they have the ability to influence the health of populations. We seek scholars from a wide range of backgrounds, including nonprofit and for-profit health care settings, NGOs, nonprofit organizations, pharma, government agencies, ministries of health, foundations, as well as non-traditional settings.  A hallmark of the program is the diversity of backgrounds, experiences, and geographic locations of our scholars. Our goal is to admit cohorts of scholars who are as different from each other as possible, since diverse cohorts of learners inspire each other to think creatively.  Successful applicants will, at minimum, have strong academic records, a master’s degree (not necessarily in public health), and leadership experience in positions with substantial management responsibility in varied public health settings.  We admit scholars into two separate cohorts each year depending on level of experience. Mid- to senior-level practitioners with at least several years of experience post-master’s degree in positions with substantial management responsibility comprise an advanced cohort of 12-15 scholars.  A second cohort of up to 25 scholars who are more junior, with at least a few years of experience post-master’s degree in positions with substantial management responsibility, comprise a cohort of emerging leaders.  For both cohorts, we seek individuals who aspire to practice-oriented careers and leadership roles in organizations in which they can have maximum influence on the public’s health.                 ### A focus on leadership development  The program builds on a successful University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill model that Dr. Suzanne Babich helped to design and which she led and refined for 10 years. Leadership skills are cultivated in the program through diverse experiences and exposure to a wide range of perspectives.  Learning is achieved experientially, through highly interactive debates and discussions. Rich exchanges happen in real time, regardless of where in the world scholars are located.  With the Fairbanks School of Public Health program, we have adapted this model, expanding and updating it to offer unique advantages, including:   ### Curriculum and competencies  All DrPH candidates must satisfactorily complete a 45 credit, online curriculum. The doctoral program in global health leadership (DrPH) competencies are aligned with the CEPH foundational competencies. P rogram graduates are expected to apply a global perspective to their mastery of all program competencies .                 #### Alumni Career Profiles  To help our prospective students understand the possibilities a doctoral degree in Public Health offers, we've asked several alumni to share the career opportunities they have had since graduating. Browse the alumni career profiles to see what our graduates are up to.   ### Admissions   #### Apply  Learn what you must complete in order to be admitted to this degree program.   #### Still have questions?  Our associate director of graduate affairs, Shawne Mathis, is available to meet with you virtually or in-person. "

    "body": "  ## MHA-JD joint degree  This course of study addresses the health services’ need for professionals who understand the legal and administrative frameworks necessary to function successfully as health lawyers or health services administrators.  Individuals must independently apply and be accepted into both the School of Public Health MHA program and the McKinney School of Law JD program. Once students have been accepted into this joint degree program, they should meet with their academic advisors to plan the course sequencing. The program includes 45 credit hours in PBHL courses, and 82 credit hours in law courses.   ### Undergraduate prerequisites  A grade of “C” or better is required for each of the pre-requisite courses listed below. Courses must be taken from an accredited institution.   ### Elizabeth Walker, JD, MHA   #### ECG Management Consultants, Inc. Senior Manager  I've always been interested in the healthcare industry. I was accepted to IU School of Medicine and intended to begin my studies after a \"year off\" at law school. I found myself very much at home in the study of the law and stumbled upon the MHA program as I sought ways to broaden my healthcare knowledge.  The quality of adjunct instructors in Indianapolis is hard to beat. I had a wide range of teachers, including a health system CEO and Hall Render attorney. Another benefit of the Indianapolis location is the opportunity to try out meaningful internships. I took advantage of every healthcare-related internship the law school had to offer.  The MHA credential is meaningful in the healthcare field. When I meet with hospital CEOs, I stand out; the MHA degree indicates to other healthcare professionals that I am dedicated to improving our healthcare community. Having an MHA degree in addition to my JD was crucial to becoming a hospital vice president at age 28.  The investment you make now to obtain these degrees will pay huge dividends for the rest of your life. Additional time in school and more tuition are small prices to pay for having a career you love. Having a JD and MHA has given me tremendous flexibility and opportunity as I have progressed in my career.  The foundation this education has provided has prepared me well to handle whatever changes this disruptive healthcare landscape presents now and in the future.

    "body": "  ## MHA Students Compete at 12th Annual UAB Case Competition  Several Master of Health Administration students at the IU Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health participated in University of Alabama at Birmingham’s 12 th Annual Health Administration Case Competition this month. This national competition is designed to be a capstone experience for graduate students from CAHME-accredited programs and provides them with the opportunity to put what they have learned into practice.  “The teams are presented with a real-life, current situation at a hospital or health system and expected to work with our team to develop a solution to the problem using only what we have learned in classes and publicly available sources,” said MHA student and UAB Case Competition team member, Samantha Pendleton.  The case Samantha and her team were tasked with not only addressed an actual issue for a hospital system (the sponsor organization), but the case also had to be resolved using only the resources the hospital currently has.  “From my perspective, it was an opportunity to work through a complex issue I may actually face after graduation,” said MHA student and UAB Case Competition team member, Matt Relano. When asked why he decided to participate, Matt’s response was simple, “for the challenge.”  And this competition is, indeed, a challenge. The Fairbanks School of Public Health team, along with students across the United States, traveled to Birmingham, Alabama, to present their recommendations before a national panel of judges.  “The first few meetings we were pretty overwhelmed with information, but I think we got to a place where we felt comfortable with our proposed solutions,” said Samantha. “We spent some time talking about our strengths and weaknesses, and it was interesting how those came into play in how we utilized each other to come up with the best solution.”  Matt agreed, saying he knew it would be a challenge, but the issues their team was trying to solve for were much harder than he had expected.  “In order to prepare for the case competition, we did a lot of research,” said third team member and MHA student, Michaela Davis. “I was eager to present our recommendations and think our team prepared well.”  In addition to research and late nights of preparation, the team practiced their presentation in front of a crowd several times leading up to the competition. At the final ceremony, the first, second, and third place case competition winners received cash awards. While the Fairbanks team did not place this year, they are glad for the experience. Many of the students who have competed in the past have used solutions their teams created at healthcare organizations they now work in, making this experience valuable in numerous ways.  “Even though it was a lot of work and stressful at times, I do think it was an invaluable experience,” Samantha said. Her teammates agreed, adding that they have enjoyed building relationships with others in the program, representing their school, and expanding their knowledge of rural health systems and healthcare in the United States.  MHA student Ellie Young said she’s enjoyed learning with the team as well. As a team observer, Ellie was expected to watch this year’s team to learn and prepare to compete next year. “I have really tried to learn from the leadership style and thought process of the second-year students to prepare for next year's case,” Ellie said. “I have really enjoyed the dialogue the team has had. There have been some excellent sharing of ideas and constructive conversations that have really helped everyone find clarity and direction.”  The Fairbanks School of Public Health team would like to congratulate the University of Minnesota MHA Program on winning this year’s competition, as well as Rush University and Johns Hopkins University for placing.

In her role, she has many opportunities to use what she learned in the Health Services Management program.  I use my Health Services Management education when speaking to insurance companies, complying with HIPAA regulations, and discussing finances with patients.  Elena contacts patients with scheduled appointments in an attempt to pre-register their visits, verifying information such as their demographics and insurance information.  “I determine if the reason for a patient’s visit is work/accident related, and if so, proceed with the documentation process.”  As her career develops, Elena would like to use her education, experience, and knowledge to advance to an executive position in a healthcare organization.  “I strive to be in a position that brings me joy knowing that I'm helping the community.”  Learn About the BSHSM Program   ## Alumni Career Profiles "

    "body": "  ## Menachemi Recognized for Excellence in Teaching by National Award  In early August, Dr. Nir Menachemi, professor and department chair for the Health Policy and Management Department at the Indiana University Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health at IUPUI, received the Excellence in Teaching Award.  Established by the Health Care Management Division of the Academy of Management in 2005, the Health Care Management Excellence in Teaching Award annually recognizes innovative and outstanding teaching. It is designed to encourage, recognize and reward the work of excellent, dedicated and inspiring teachers.  According to his students and colleagues, Menachemi fits the bill, playing a vital role in the lives of his students.  “He has been a critical component in my career, having served as my program director, teacher, and enduring mentor,” said Menachemi’s former student, now assistant professor, Alva Ferdinand.  “He offered to do an independent study with me to explain the fundamentals of statistics… and when I didn’t understand a concept, he happily found alternative ways to explain it to me until I understood,” Ferdinand said. “When the independent study came to an end, I was adequately prepared to face my methods courses with greater confidence.”  Through his dynamic lecturing style, conversations about current events, and innovative group assignments, Menachemi is able to engage students of all levels.  “He has a unique way of teaching students the art of publishing,” said Paul Halverson, Founding Dean and Professor at the Fairbanks School of Public Health. “He introduces students to the publishing processes, mentors them, and provides invaluable edits throughout the entire experience.”  Students flock to Menachemi for mentoring, as he has published more than 200 peer-reviewed scientific papers and chaired over a dozen dissertation committees. While his research – examining how organizational strategies impact critical performance measures – is intensive, he still finds time to invest in his students.  “He is generous with his time, making himself available to students via skype, over the phone while commuting, and during the weekends,” Dean Halverson said. “His enthusiasm is contagious, not only for students, but for faculty as well.”  Tory Hogan, an assistant professor at The Ohio State University College of Public Health, would agree. “When Dr. Menachemi and I co-taught a healthcare strategy course, I saw first-hand how powerful he is as a teacher,” Hogan said. “He is one of the most engaging and energetic professors I have ever been in the classroom with.”  Hogan believes Menachemi gives life to the content he teaches by making each concept relevant for today’s healthcare world. Even the most complicated of ideas are understandable to his students. As a first-year assistant professor, Hogan finds herself reflecting on her experiences with Menachemi .  “While creating my own courses, I find myself asking ‘how would Dr. Menachemi present this idea to students’ and ‘how would he explain these concepts,’” Hogan said. “I hope I am able to affect students the way he has affected me.” "

    "body": "  ## Alumni Career Profile: Sarah Vivo  BS in Health Services Management, 2016 Current Title: Program Manager, Mission Delivery Current Employer: American Cancer Society  Sarah was working with patients in the hospital setting, but believed that real healing required more than tests and prescriptions. That’s ultimately why she chose the Bachelor of Science in Health Services Management (BSHSM) program at IUPUI. She wanted a degree that would incorporate management within the entire healthcare sector, and knew the BSHSM program at the Fairbanks School of Public Health offered that.  What Sarah didn’t know before choosing to study Health Services Management was how many resources she would gain along the way. “While at IUPUI, I learned a lot about finding resources, such as the library, online systems, professors and even other students to enhance my learning experience.”  Sarah said she uses her Health Services Management education in her current job, which is also the first job she began after graduating. In fact, two of the largest parts of her job are people management and program management.  Because Sarah has so many volunteers and programs to manage, she uses critical thinking, communication and goal-setting skills on a daily basis.  “I manage several programs that assist and impact the everyday lives of cancer patients in central and southern Indiana. Most of these programs require volunteers to be successful, so I currently manage over 300 volunteers!”  My overall understanding of public health and healthcare is an asset. I interact with many different organizations in the healthcare sector.  Sarah really enjoys working in the health-related nonprofit sector, providing important supportive services that complement the traditional \"diagnosis and treatment\" side of medicine. Though she enjoys her current role, Sarah is excited about what’s to come.  “I'd like to continue my career with a nonprofit, hopefully expanding health programs and services that serve my fellow Hoosiers.”  Learn About the BSHSM Program   ## Alumni Career Profiles "

    "body": "  ## PhD in Epidemiology admission requirements  Admission into the Epidemiology PhD program is based on completion of a baccalaureate degree, although it is anticipated that many applicants will have completed a post baccalaureate degree in public health or other health related discipline.  Application, admission, and degree-granting requirements and regulations shall be applied equitably to all individuals, applicants and students regardless of age, gender, race, disability, sexual orientation, religion or national origin.  [SOPHAS Apply to this doctoral program »](https://sophas.aspph.org/)   ### SOPHAS  Apply to this doctoral program »   ### Admissions Deadlines  See the deadlines to apply to each of our degree programs »   ### Application criteria and requirements  In addition to completing the SOPHAS application, you are also required to submit the following supporting documentation directly to SOPHAS.   ## Graduate Record Examination (GRE)  GRE scores are not required for admission, however, if you plan to attend the PhD program as a full-time funded student, you are strongly encouraged to submit them with your application, since some funding sources require current GRE scores (less than five years old) in order for students to be eligible.  Applicants must submit GRE scores to SOPHAS using the following designation DI Code 0167.  The admission committee does not list expected minimum scores.   ## Statement of Purpose and Objectives  Provide an essay of approximately 750 words describing your past education, experience, and current professional career objectives. You are encouraged to comment on any or all of the following: plans you have to use your education and training; the needs and/or challenges you perceive as important in your field of study; and any personal qualities, characteristics, and skills you believe will enable you to be successful in your chosen field of study.   ## Résumé or CV  For each position on the résumé or CV, provide the job title, employing agency, dates employed, and responsibilities held. Indicate any additional strengths or skills such as fluency in foreign languages, research experience, teaching experience, community service, and demonstration of leadership skills. Include professional certifications, honors, and awards.   ## Official Post-Secondary Transcripts  Transcripts from all U.S. institutions attended are required (must be sent directly from the institutions to SOPHAS). This includes previous study at Indiana University. It is strongly recommended that all transcripts be submitted no later than December 15 to allow SOPHAS adequate time to verify transcripts. Please note that it can take up to four weeks for transcripts to be verified.  World Education Services (WES) ICAP evaluation of foreign academic credentials The Indiana University Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health requires all applicants with foreign academic credentials to provide a World Education Services (WES) ICAP course-by-course evaluation of those credentials. Applicants should submit their transcripts to WES at least one month in advance of the application deadline to ensure that the evaluation is completed in time.  Through special arrangements with SOPHAS, WES will deliver its credential evaluation report directly to SOPHAS by secure electronic transmission. This expedites the delivery of the evaluation report—as well as images of the applicant’s verified transcripts—to SOPHAS and allows SOPHAS to process the report most efficiently.  Visit WES for more information  [Visit WES for more information](http://www.wes.org/sophas/)  U.S. applicants who have attended post-secondary institutions outside of the U.S. as part of a study-abroad program at a U.S. college or university, do not need to provide a WES evaluation of their foreign coursework as long as it is noted on their U.S. transcript.  Please note: Upon admission to IUPUI, international students will be required to provide the Indiana University Office of International Affairs with original transcripts from all universities attended in the U.S. and abroad.   ## Letters of Recommendation  Three letters of recommendation are required from from persons qualified to assess your academic work; clinical, public health, or professional experiences; or, leadership potential in public health. These letters should be from professional sources that can provide an unbiased, current and critical assessment of your abilities, skills, strengths, and weaknesses related to successfully completing a doctoral program.   ## Interview  The applicants are invited to interview at the discretion of the admission committee.  In-person interview: Applicants will be invited to participate in an in-person interview with several members of the admission committee. Alternative arrangements can be made for applicants unable to be interviewed onsite.  Completion of an on-site essay: Applicants participating in the interview process may be asked to write a short essay on a specific topic assigned to them using Microsoft Word. The purpose of this step is to allow the admissions committee to assess the applicant's English writing skills.  The PhD in Epidemiology admissions committee conducts interviews using Skype video conferencing for applicants who are unable to travel to Indianapolis for the interview. Skype is a free software application that allows users to connect through the internet to communicate. Note that applicants will need access to a webcam and microphone for the interview.   ## Proof of English Proficiency  Applicants whose native language is not English or whose academic study was done exclusively at non-English speaking institutions, must prove English proficiency by providing either official Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or International English Language Testing System (IELTS) scores. Scores must be less than two years old.  The preferred minimum English language test scores for admission to the Fairbanks School of Public Health are:  [TOEFL](https://www.ets.org/toefl)  [IELTS](https://www.ielts.org/)   ####   #### SOPHAS applicants  SOPHAS applicants should use the following designations:   #### English Language test waiver  The English Language test requirement may be waived if an applicant has earned a bachelor’s degree or higher from the U.S. or other English-speaking country.  See more information  [See more information](http://iapply.iupui.edu/english-speaking-countries/)   ### Review of applications  Completed applications will be carefully reviewed by the Epidemiology PhD admissions committee after the program deadline.

[online via SOPHAS](https://sophas.aspph.org/)  Remember to designate the IU Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health as one of your school choices, along with your desired program.  We'll notify you by email once your application has been received. If you have questions about the application process or about the PhD in Epidemiology program, contact Shawne Mathis at snmathis@iu.edu .  Note: All applications must be verified by SOPHAS prior to the deadline to be guaranteed review by the PhD Epidemiology admissions committee. Applications that are not verified by the deadline are not guaranteed review. Applications take four to five weeks to be verified by SOPHAS. We recommend submitting your application to SOPHAS no later than one month prior to the deadline.  Upon offer of admission, applicants will need to complete the IU Graduate CAS, a required secondary application, by using the invitation code and link provided with the admission offer.

    "body": "  ## Alumni Profile  In January 2017, John J. Wernert, MD (MHA, ‘96), joined the Sagamore Institute as a Vice President and the inaugural Director of the Center for National Health Policy and Innovation. The new Sagamore health policy center will assist health innovators and motivated political leaders to shape new health policy and practice with evidence and experience from the nation’s most successful states, like Indiana.  This new role will allow Wernert the opportunity to continue his service in health policy and focus on innovative models of care delivery. “The leaders and scholars at the Sagamore Institute are more than just an academic think tank; we are a real world ‘do tank,’ and we are working with various stakeholder groups to deploy these innovations into the healthcare field,” he said.  Wernert obtained his degree while practicing psychiatry at Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis. He credits his MHA degree for shaping his career path. “By having my Master of Health Administration it opened up all kinds of leadership opportunities that I wouldn’t have been able to pursue as a clinician alone.” As a physician and psychiatrist, the MHA degree provided him administrative skills, as well as a budgeting and finance education that he has relied on heavily throughout his career.  Wernert believes that students today are more savvy with technology and social media which will shape the future of healthcare delivery. He encourages students to recognize the unlimited opportunities that exist in healthcare. “For students pursuing an MHA or an MPH today, there is not a more exciting field to be considering. We are going from one wave to the next of delivering health services, and having an advanced degree will provide students the ability to get the educational background and field experiences to use it as a springboard for launching your healthcare career.”  Wernert served in the cabinet of former Gov. Mike Pence from 2014 to 2017 as the first physician to lead the Family and Social Services Administration for the state of Indiana. Wernert has practiced integrative medicine as a psychiatrist for 25 years, and credits his training in the MHA program with the ability to pivot from healthcare delivery to his administrative service with the state and now the Sagamore Institute.

I want to express our gratitude to both you and Governor Holcomb for leading Indiana’s response to COVID-19.  As Dr. Box mentioned, I’m Dr. Paul Halverson, founding dean of the IU Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health at IUPUI. Founded in 2012, the Fairbanks School of Public Health is committed to protecting and advancing the health of Hoosiers in Indiana and beyond. In the last eight years, our faculty and staff have responded to public health and health administration issues with evidence-based research and practice – from the opioid and tobacco crises to rising health care costs; from developing maternal and child health interventions to leading a large-scale response to chronic diseases like diabetes – we have been on the frontlines of Hoosier health in Indiana.  We are also pleased to support Indiana’s local public health departments through our support of the local health officer association as well as in training individuals who will be our public health leaders of tomorrow. In addition, we are proud to work closely with both Dr. Box and her leadership team here at ISDH as well as Dr. Caine, our local Marion County Health Officer (all of whom are doing an incredible job supporting our state during these very challenging times).  Since the emergence of the virus, our school has been supporting the state’s response to COVID-19. Working with public health officials and hospital leaders, including at the Indiana Hospital Association, we created forecasting models to predict the spread of COVID-19 in Indiana and understand hospital surge capacity. With this knowledge, we developed capacity planning models for hospitals and health systems. Now, our school is leading the random sample testing initiative across Indiana for the virus that causes COVID-19 and its antibodies.  Nir Menachemi: Thank you, Dr. Halverson. I am pleased to lead the scientific team in our partnership with the State which includes multiple agencies and private organizations that Dr. Box will soon mention. The team from the Fairbanks School includes leading biostatisticians, epidemiologist, informatics, and clinical infectious disease experts. Together with the State we are taking a critical step toward understanding how COVID-19 has affected the population of Indiana.  I want to highlight an important distinction in how this testing initiative differs for existing testing endeavors. To date, almost all of the testing that has occurred has come from patients with serious symptoms or other high-risk individuals including our frontline health care workers. Existing tests were purposefully focused on clinical settings to support clinical decisions affecting individual patients. Because these tests only focused on sick or high-risk individuals, we lack an understanding of how many people in our state have been infected especially if they were not formally tested or had no symptoms.  This is where our work comes in. We will obtain scientifically valid results of the proportion of state residents that are currently infected (regardless of symptoms) and those that may have already been infected with the virus based on antibodies. We will finally obtain an understanding of the true prevalence of COVID-19. The individuals we will test have been selected randomly to represent everyone in the state above the age of 12. Each selected individual will be asked to volunteer their participation with parental approval, as necessary. Those agreeing will provide both a nasal swab- to test for active viral infection, and a blood draw- to allow for antibody testing.  Whereas existing tests have supported clinical decisions of individual patients; our approach will allow for a community-level understanding of the virus’ impact. This will enable better evidence-based policies—including the complex decisions surrounding social distancing orders.  We have identified a representative sample of Indiana residents by randomly selecting people, in each district of the state, from a list of all residents. Our randomization protocol was carefully calibrated to ensure the ability to draw conclusions about the impact of COVID-19 by each of the state’s districts, sex, race, and ethnicity; as well as overall rates for the state. For this reason, if you are selected, please consider participating so that your community, however you define it, can be represented in our data.  Our overall plan is to conduct multiple waves of data collection that will occur months apart. Wave 1 will start immediately and provide critical information including establishing a baseline. Each additional wave of testing will allow us to examine how changes in the prevalence of the disease is progressing in Indiana and how it is affecting the groups I just mentioned. For each wave, we will enroll 5 to 7 thousand individuals statewide. In order to adhere to the scientific protocol, only those contacted by ISDH will be able to participate. Unfortunately, we will not be able to test others at our drive-thru testing locations.  Before turning it over back to Dr. Box, who will describe the logistical and operational plan, I want to reiterate the importance of our study in determining the true count of infections, including mild cases, which represents important information not currently widely available in any state. By being among the first states, we will get a head start in understanding the epidemic’s true trajectory, identify and address disparities, and be able to make wiser decisions on how to deploy our limited resources. Thank you, Governor Holcomb, and Dr. Box, for your leadership during these challenging times. We look forward to playing our part in advancing Indiana towards a sense of normalcy. Dr. Box, back to you.  I am pleased to introduce Dr. Nir Menachemi who is leading this population health scientific testing effort. Dr. Menachemi is the Fairbanks Endowed Chair of Public Health and leads our Department of Health Policy and Management. He is also a scientist at the Regenstrief Institute. Professor Menachemi is one of the most widely respected health services researchers in the country. Dr. Menachemi’s research has led to numerous organizational and societal decisions that have made enduring contributions to improving people’s health in Indiana and beyond.   ### Participation  Individuals were selected by a computer algorithm. Because this study is carefully designed to be a representative sample of our state, only those people who were randomly selected will be able to participate in this study. If you are chosen, we hope that you will participate.   ### Individual results  If you participated in the random sample test and have not received your results, please call ( 877) 826-0011 and select the \"provider\" option.   ### Media  [LETTER: Death isn’t only COVID measure that matters Letter to the editor published in the IBJ by Drs.

    "body": "  ## ECHO FAQs   ### 1. What is ECHO?  Project ECHO, developed by Dr. Sanjeev Aurora at the University of New Mexico (UNM) in 2003, provides a framework for sharing expertise across the state and as a result will help patients get access to care without leaving the providers they trust and the communities where they live and work.  ECHO uses technology to leverage medical expertise, reduces disparities in care by sharing knowledge, and provides case-based learning to enhance mastery of new information. Evaluation of the programs through UNM, and around the world, showed increased patient and provider satisfaction, retention of patients in their medical home, equal or better patient outcomes when treated in their community by their provider, enhanced retention of providers in underserved areas, reduced costs of treating late-stage disease and improved public health prevention efforts.   ### 2. How is ECHO model different from traditional telemedicine?  The ECHO model is not 'traditional telemedicine' where the specialist assumes care of the patient, but instead is a guided practice model where the participating providers retain responsibility for managing their patients. In other words, specialists at the Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health ECHO Center at IUPUI provide telementorship to participating providers who are learning how to apply best practice strategies in their own practices.   ### 3. What is a teleECHO clinic?  A teleECHO clinic is essentially virtual grand rounds. Primary care providers from multiple locations around the state of Indiana connect at regularly scheduled times with a team of specialists using low-cost, multi-point videoconferencing. During teleECHO clinics providers present patient cases to specialist expert teams who mentor the providers to manage patients with common, complex conditions. These case-based discussions are supplemented with short didactic presentations to improve content knowledge and share evidence based best practices.   ### 4. Why should I or my health center consider participating in teleECHO clinics? What are the benefits?  Project ECHO is a unique tool that enables providers to improve their expertise while treating patients with common complex conditions rather than referring them on to specialists. Patients will receive care in their local communities with providers they trust – you. As a participant, you will have weekly access to a panel of experts as well as a community of colleagues from around the state who are committed to improving patient care. Participating in ECHO can increase patient retention in your practice and improve patient satisfaction.   ### 5. Is there a fee to join?  Joining an ECHO project at the RMFSPH ECHO Center is free to all providers. ECHO clinics will meet online using freely available, web-based Zoom videoconferencing. Each session will consist of a brief didactic presentation of a topic related to medical care and presentations and discussions of case patients by participating providers. The group of 25-30 community providers will have the opportunity to work through each case in a collaborative fashion and receive guidance from the multidisciplinary expert ECHO team. To participate, you only need to have access to the Internet. Participation with a webcam is highly encouraged but not absolutely required.   ### 6. When do teleECHO clinics occur?  The Hepatitis C (HCV) ECHO was the first-ever ECHO clinic hosted in the state of Indiana! HCV ECHO clinics are ongoing every other Thursday from 12:30-1:30 p.m. ET.  The LGBTQ+ ECHO 90-minute clinics will be from 2:30-4:00pm ET every second and fourth Wednesday of each month.  Each ECHO program will run for one year at minimum. ECHO participants are highly encouraged to regularly join the teleECHO community through these clinic sessions in order to become master care.   ### 7. How do I register?  If you are interested in registering for a ECHO program through the RMFSPH ECHO Center, please fill out a brief form . Once registered, a packet of information will be sent to you via email. We hope you’ll consider joining us for an ECHO program in Indiana!  [please fill out a brief form](https://redcap.uits.iu.edu/surveys/index.php?s=TR4LW4LH4W)   ### 8. Is the ECHO clinic approved for Continuing Medical Education?  Yes, AMA PRA Category Credit(s)™ is available for most ECHO clinics and are awarded by Indiana University School of Medicine.  The Indiana University School of Medicine is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) to provide continuing medical education for physicians. For the HCV ECHO clinics, the Indiana University School of Medicine designates this live educational activity for a maximum of one AMA PRA Category 1 Credit(s)™.  Physicians should only claim credit commensurate with the extent of their participation in the activity. In accordance with the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) Standards for Commercial Support, educational programs sponsored by the Indiana University School of Medicine must demonstrate balance, independence, objectivity, and scientific rigor. For questions about CME, please contact: Division of Continuing Medical Education (317) 274-0104 cme@iu.edu cme.medicine.iu.edu "

    "body": "  ## Conversations on leadership with state health officials  What qualities contribute to effective state health officials (SHOs)? Public health leadership has been analyzed and written about, but few studies have examined the personal characteristics and experiences of state health leaders and what their leadership looks like in the context of their state.  Ed Baker and Hugh Tilson interviewed current and former SHOs to learn about their individual experiences as health leaders. The following short videos summarize these conversations.   ### Experienced state health officials share insight about what it means to be a successful SHO  Description of the video:  Ed:            What does success look like to you as you reflect back on your tenure as a state health director?    John:         I think that the biggest indicator of success is being able to point to some sign, some concrete sign that health actually improved as a result of actions that I took, or I took in partnership with other people at the department. Ideally, that's improved health and some indication that people were healthier as a result of our policies or our programs. It may be other surrogate markers that are suggestive of success, but I think that would be the gold standard. I'd settle for a silver standard that had to do with improving awareness, knowledge, perhaps attitudes in some measurable way, that were more supportive of public health or of activities that would promote health.    Hugh:         What's your definition of success? What's success in public health for a state health officer?    Nicole:       For a state health official, in my view, success means that you're able to bring some of your own skillsets, talents, gifts and abilities to a state public health agency; be able to embed with and add to the expertise that already exists there; and advance that agency to another level prior to leaving. For example, from my perspective, our agency had a real focus on health equity. And my entire career has involved a commitment to eliminating disparities, and achieving health equity, and making sure that there is equitable access to services and care for people. Bringing those together has been a signature goal for me, to be able to make sure that our Health Equity Zones Initiative that the department had already birthed, that I was able to join with and take to the next level in promoting it at the state level, is successful. We want it to be successful. We want it to be sustained. For me, one of the demonstrations of success will be that by the time I leave the Health Equity Zones Initiative it is not only successful, institutionalized, and well-embedded into our state system with sustainable funding for making the difference that it's intended to, going forward.    Ed:              What does success look like to you when you reflect back on your term as the director of                        the state health department in Maryland?    Benjamin:   Well, my goals when I was coming in as a state health official—I had come in as being the                          Deputy, and I moved to being Secretary—I absolutely wanted to make sure that I had                     ultimately improved the health of the people in Maryland. That was my ultimate goal. We                                were really excited, because we actually think we achieved it while I was there.    Ed:             What in your mind’s eye does success look like when you think back about your term as a                        State Health Official?\"    Devlin:       Well, Ed, when I look back on my years as a State Health Official and think about what                             success looks like, I remember that we chose a few priorities, because there are so many                            issues in public health that need to be addressed, and that we're working on. But, I decided                               what were the things that I wanted to be able to say, \"During my time, we made a difference                  on school health; on preparedness, on disparities, and building the public health                                     infrastructure was another priority, and working on Women and Children's issues.\" So, we                            had those five broad priority areas and how do we move policy? Were we able to put new                      programs or shore up existing services? What were the partnerships we developed, and did                            we have impact in the end through those different strategies?  Hugh:        Let’s just start off with your definition of success. What’s a… What is a successful state health,                officer?    Engel:        Well, I have to look at my environment, which is the state of North Carolina, and, I think, in                     my state, the Health Director role is, actually, defined in statute, and it has to be a physician                  licensed in that state. That is, pretty much, it. But, in reality, in my time, I think, the success                              was a dual role. The Health Director needed to wear the hat of the Surgeon General, that is,                  the subject matter in the public health science of the state, and the second role, is a leader                           and manager of a very division, within the department of Health and Human Services, that                     division being the division of Public Health. So, I think, success was mainly due to wearing                       those two hats, simultaneously, being that valued, trusted, credible public health scientist, as                     well as a really good manager leading a very complicated division, and an even more                                       complicated department.    Hugh:        What is success?    Halverson: It’s interesting.  I’ll answer that question by first telling you a bit of a story.  When I first                          arrived in Arkansas as the State Health Commissioner you may remember it was after the                          unfortunate and untimely death of Dr. Fay Boozman who was in that role and died in a farm                      accident.  That, in and of itself you know, was a public health issue.  When I first came to be in                that role, I had a chance to go around to all of our 75 counties and 93 offices.  I did that over a      year but one of the first trips I made I actually went to a rural part of Arkansas and had a                              chance to really drive in the neighborhoods in small towns.  Usually that meant going on dirt                  roads.  Frequently it meant just trying to get a sense of where people live and what their                             conditions were that they lived in every day.  Inherently, I knew it was different than what I                        lived at.  What I found was and I’ll never get it out of my mind was children playing in a dirty                  street and there was just something about it.  As I talked to people in the community I                      discovered that many of these kids hadn’t had anything to eat and there really were                                 problems in terms of malnutrition and just not having the sense that they will really have a                     full meal.  Not really having the advantages, I think, that a lot of people.  We would all like to                  say that our kids can grow up and have a carefree life and these kids didn’t.  It was interesting               to me.  It set the stage for what to me is success and that is being able to intervene, to create                             the conditions under which people really can be healthy.  To me, take it another step forward               and say it’s really about giving kids hope, right?  Not just the kids, but their parents.  As we all                      live together in communities it seems to me that one of the most important things that we                     could strive for in terms of public health is the success of providing the opportunity for                  people to have hope that tomorrow will be better than today.  That there is reason to believe        that because of public health there is a better tomorrow.  I’m sorry, maybe it sounds corny.                   To me, it was a driving force to say, “You know, we can do better than this.”  So that has been           on my mind along with a number of other things about how I wanted to change the way that                  we lived, worked, played and worked together as a community.    Hugh:        What is your definition of success for a state health officer?    Harmon:    I think the first thing is to have a successful relationship with different leadership bodies in                     the state.  The Governor’s Office, the legislature, the local health departments, the non-                          profits so that you can have a successful agenda with your legislation.  Your budget is very                              important and the different programs.  Then with all of that to be able to continue in your job               for a reasonable period of time so that you have long enough to bring those programs and                             initiatives to a successful completion and continuation.    Hugh:        As a state health officer, what does success mean? What is a successful state health officer?    Lloyd:       Well, times have changed so much, as you know, Hugh. We have a situation now where most                 of the health officers are at super agencies. I think one of the greatest parts of being a health                           officer in Connecticut is I reported directly to the governor, which was Tom Meskill and then                     Ella Grasso. When she died, that was Bill O'Neill.    Hugh:       What was success?    Lloyd:       Well, we were very successful in many different ways. First of all, we had the first hospice in                   the United States in Branford. I've been back to see that several times. I remember the day we     got a call on the Lyme arthritis. Annie was my secretary. She said, \"There's this woman on the                  line, and she's nearly hysterical because of these large things on her.\" It was Lyme arthritis,                    named for Lyme, Connecticut. We were the second state in the United States to have a rate                       setting commission. That was back in the days of certificate of need. Of course, they don't do                        that now; they negotiate with health plans. We were the second state in the country to have                 an EMS system. Indiana, I think, was the first.    Hugh:       What’s your definition of success as a State Health Officer? What is that?    Lumpkin:  I think success of a Public Health Officer at the state level is threefold to the extent that they                 create the conditions in which local public health can be successful. Health and public health                         occurs at the local level where people live, learn, work and play. The State Health Agency’s                             primary job is to make sure that that happens at the local level and that could occur through                 working through local health agencies or through direct action by the State Health Agency                     itself. The second measure of success is to the extent in which the broader health context is                        addressed. That means initially working with other state agencies whose primary purpose may                not be health, but who have a direct impact upon the health of the people in that state. That                    includes the Department of Education, Department of Transportation, as well as others that                        are more likely suspects like Human Services. Then, the third measure of success is the extent                in which the Public Health Director, the Public Health Official improves the functioning of their            agency through adoption of quality-improvement methods, through the focus on innovation                      and a persistence of focus upon the workforce to help improve the qualifications and capacity                            of that workforce to be able to carry out our continuing public health mission.    Hugh:       What is your definition of a successful state health officer?    Monroe:  I have to tell you, Hugh, my definition of a successful state health officer is someone, to be                     honest, first and foremost, that enjoys the job and enjoys engaging with the public, and with                        the legislators, and with their governor and all the stakeholders, because I think that's one of                        the keys to success. Going from there, if you get those relationships well established and                        you're enjoying it, then you can take on the challenges. Honestly, as a state health officer you                   do want to see some policy advance. So that's one of the successes is if you've advanced really                           good public health policy in your state, which is not an easy thing to accomplish, by the way. If                you get the stakeholders and the coalitions, begin to build coalitions or promote coalitions             that have already been established that are actually doing good work, I think that's another       characteristic of a successful state health officer.    Hugh:    I'd love to hear your definition of success from your own experience and maybe a few of the      factors that you think made you successful.    Mary:     Approaching that term \"success\" is very interesting when you're at the state level because, depending on the issue, it might be a very quick issue with a quick turnaround, and what you're hoping is that you're really going to have a longer-term impact on the population in your state. As I think about success it's always wonderful to have hindsight and to look back and say, what was that thing that really made a difference? I was very fortunate that I got to serve multiple governors for a number of years. And a big issue for us was tobacco prevention, for example, but it took 10 years to see what difference that made. We did get a smoke-free state, and you see that pretty quickly. You do get some numbers that tell you kids are starting to smoke less. But you're looking for, what's that health impact? And as we got more adults to quit we actually saw a reduction in respiratory diseases showing up in hospitals. Success can look like an epidemiology curve. Success can be a good headline that thanks the department of health for doing something very well. Success can also be an okay nod from a governor giving you an attagirl or an attaboy for following through on something that was very tough.           ### In a snapshot, former and current state health officials share advice with new SHOs  Description of the video:  Devlin:             Some of the advice that I would give to a new state health official is to first of all remember that it's about the issues in the system, it's not about you. So, you know, do your best and sometimes it's going to work, and sometimes it’s not. This is hard work over the long haul. The second is to be transparent in everything you do. Be ready to read about it in the paper tomorrow, or be able to have a conversation about it with your Mom or your Grand-Mom about it. And let that be one of your guides. Surround yourself with good people and be sure that you’re supporting your leadership to the very best extent that you can. Work on your communication skills and build those partnership in the community, along with the team that you have inside. Because, that is how you're going to be able to go forward.    Benjamin:        The first thing to remember is these are temp jobs and many things that will come to you that are unanticipated. You need to decide what two or three things that you want to do so that at the end of your tenure, whatever it is, however long or however short it is, that you feel that you've accomplished what you went to do the job for. Recognize that what's going to be layered on top of that is your governor's or your mayor's priorities, depending on where you are, and the stuff that just happens, that the legislature gives you and fate puts in your way. If you focus on the few things you want to do and get your team focused around that, and deal with the mandates that you're given, you'll be quite successful.  John:                I would recommend a few things. One thing I would recommend is recognizing you hold the position for a short period of time, and that you have the potential to make a difference. Pick a few priorities, work on those, and enjoy yourself. The second thing I'd say is have a support system. That can be your family, your friends, it can be your peers through ASTHO, but you need a support system. You need people who are there to help you think things through, to remind you you're a good human being on a really bad day, and also to keep you humble and remind you that if your people are standing up and applauding you, it's really more about the position than you. You need a reality check from people who love you and care about you. Finally, I would say it's good to think about the future. Too many state health officials begin to think about \"what next\" at the point they're no longer a state health official. It's not easy to think about the future when you're in the midst of such an important role, but it's worthwhile doing that. Again, I think ask ASTHO and former state health officials who've made that transition can be very helpful in terms of helping think about what their transition was like, what the other career possibilities might be. You want to make sure that you're not caught by surprise and find yourself in a difficult situation at the end of your tenure.  Engel:               Again, it depends on your state environment. But, be that subject-matter expert, and be that good manager. But, also, learn how to lead up, whoever you’re reporting to. In my case, it was the secretary, and a big-umbrella agency, called Health and Human Services. You may be reporting directly to the Governor, and maybe, sitting on that Cabinet. To me, that was the hardest, was that leading-up. Understand the politics, know that a politics[phonetic] is more emotion than fact. If you’re not getting along with a leader, as you’re leading up, take that person out to lunch. Get to know them better. That was my mistake. If I could do it over again, that’s what I would have done.  Nicole:             For the next generation of public health leaders my message would be, certainly follow your heart, do what you are passionate about. It's absolutely what has led me to this role. But then also think outside the box. Don't consider yourself to be the only one that's thinking that, or start from scratch, but look around you to see how you can leverage the partners who are there, because being effective within public health, the one thing it requires is for you to not do it by yourself. The ability to know how to engage partners, how to speak the language that they speak so that we can get the outcomes, is what I would encourage future public health leaders to focus on so that we can get some new outcomes and better results for the populations that we serve.  Dr. Harmon:     Well, it’s one of the most enjoyable jobs I’ve ever had.  It was really fun.  It was challenging because of all the politics and the lack of funding, it was a continual effort. It’s like being head of a foundation.  You are continually trying to raise money, a non-profit.  Use ASTHO, use the resources of ASTHO.  It is a great way to learn quickly what lies ahead and the networking opportunities.  Get to know the State Health Officers in the neighboring states because you have cross-border issues.  Another important one is work closely with your local health department partners.  In maybe 10 of the states its unified and the locals are state employees.  That’s the way it is in Florida.  That makes it easier if you are all in the same agency.  In fact, if not, you really need to get to know them.  I visited all 112 local public health agencies in Missouri.  It took two and a half years, I think.  I created a partnership council with three large, three medium, and three small size health department reps.  We met monthly or quarterly, I can’t remember, but that’s where we dealt with challenging issues of funding formulas, funding distribution, big priority areas.  HIVA was a big one for me back then in the late 1980’s.  Then you can count on them as allies instead of opponents.  They were independent in Missouri.  They have their own relationship with legislators so when I go into town to visit with the local public health agency.  I would also visit the local legislator in his or her office locally.  I remember one time I was telling the Governor about this, John Ashcroft.  I had a very good relationship with John, and I said, “I’m trying to visit all of the local Public Health Agencies in the state.”  He looked at me and he said, “What are you running for?”  I said, “Well, nothing Governor.”  He was joking.  Have a good relationship with your Governor if you report directly to him.  You may not report to him and if you don’t report to the Governor have a very good relationship with your Agency Secretary or the leader of your Umbrella Agency.  Then, if possible, also have a good relationship with legislators or someone in the Governor’s Office.  Monroe:           The relationship between public health and private medicine is one that quite frankly has intrigued me my entire career. I think we miss opportunities all the time with private medicine and public health. That's, when we think about the leadership of state health officers and what they can bring to the table, is forging a strong relationship with the Hospital Association at the state level and then with CEO's.    A quick story. I was state health officer. Had been state health officer in Indiana two or three years by this point. There was something I had a question about, and I started calling CEO's of hospitals. And I called one particular CEO in a moderate-sized town who'd been the CEO of this hospital for 30 years, and he said, \"This is the first time a state health officer has ever picked up the phone to talk to me,\" and he was thrilled. He was thrilled with the call. We ended up probably talking an hour. We covered all kinds of issues. He became one of the greatest advocates for public health during my tenure and after. Picking up the phone, talking at that top leader, the state health officer, the beauty—and I love this part of the job—was that quite frankly anybody would take my phone call. CEO's of companies, CEO's of hospitals, it didn't matter, as the state health officer, folks would take your call because they knew you worked for the governor and they had an interest in that. Use that wisely because we need to forge more relationships. And then if it's starting at the top, then you can engage the local health officer to work with the local hospitals and with the medical staff.    One of the things I did as state health officer is I started very strategic communications out to all licenses professionals. And it would depend, sometimes it would only be to the physicians, sometimes it would be to the pharmacists, nurses and so forth. Some other state health officers have followed suit with that. That's another bully pulpit opportunity that state health officers have. If new state health officers are coming into the job and that's not established in your state, seize that opportunity, but be strategic about it. You don't want to overwhelm the practicing physicians with communications.    Actually, we started a medicine and public health day. It was the Indiana...it was the commissioner's public health and medicine day. I actually got the residency programs to close down for the day, have the faculty cover their patients, and we'd bring residents in to highlight all the things that had happened in public health in Indiana for a year. Looking back in the year before, what were the issues that medicine should care about, that public health had been managing, and those kinds of things. It was a really robust and fun day. So, you can be creative with it.   ### Guiding principles and best practices for working with elected officials  Description of the video:  Baker: Help us understand better what you might call some best practices. You worked hard to develop those relationships with the governors that you served under, with their chiefs of staff, with those people. In just the governor's office now, what could you suggest worked for you, perhaps? What could you suggest might be helpful to other people that want to strengthen their relationship with the governor's office in this job that you had?  Auerbach: Over the course of my tenure, both before being the state health commissioner and after, I worked with four governors—two of them Democrat, two of them Republican. They were quite different leaders. One thing I learned was you need to understand who's sitting in that office and what their priorities are what their work style is, and you need to accommodate that. I do appreciate that the governor is the one in charge, and our role needs to be assisting the governor in making the right decisions, being flexible. That is an important part of the job. I've worked for governors, for example, some of whom were micromanagers and others of whom who were libertarian: they felt like they didn't want to get into details, they wanted you to figure things out, they just wanted there to be no negative stories. It was important to adapt accordingly. That was very important.  I'd say another lesson I learned was patience with transition. We went through many different newly-hired people in the governor's office. Not the governors but their staff. It seemed to us every six months there was some new, really young, inexperienced person who would be hired in the governor's office, whoever the governor was, that would call us up with a bunch of ideas and misunderstandings about what we did. When that's happened several times you begin to feel like, do I have to explain this all over again to another new person who's just entered government? What I've learned was you do. You need to be really patient and you need to take that relationship quite seriously and not express any frustration but be well-prepared to do a thorough briefing and accommodate the needs of the governor's staff.  Baker: One other thing you mentioned different from the governor's staff and the governor's office is working with the legislature. That's a whole different world. Say a little bit about your experiences there, because, again, some state health officials have never worked with people who are in elected positions in state government. What was that like? That's different.  Auerbach: I enjoyed working with the state legislature. The starting point, though, I would say was that when I worked for different governors they had different approaches to what a department head should be doing in terms of relations with the legislature. Some of the governors encouraged me to reach out to individual legislators and develop relationships and talk about my programs. I worked for a couple of governors who wanted legislative relations to be handled exclusively by the governor's office. So, it was different under different circumstances. I enjoyed working with the legislators. I enjoyed getting to know their staff. Their staff were often the key people that we needed to get to know. We paid a lot of attention to being responsive. If we got a call from a legislator, if they wanted an answer, once we got clearance from the governor's office, we tried to be incredibly helpful to them. We tried to answer quickly and accurately. We followed up with them. We wanted them to believe that we understood that we, in some sense, worked for them and that we were well-trained, smart, and responsible.  Baker: Let's go back to one relationship issue that I think new State officials need to learn more about. You worked very actively with elected officials in the States general assembly. Obviously, there is a Governor’s office, we'll talk about that in a moment. But, can you say a little more about relationship about with people, elected officials, around the Public Health issues. What did you actually do? How did that go? Maybe, you were telling me a story one time about the State lab, and trying to get, you were all driving off on a trip somewhere and you were working with some of these people. But, that part of working with elected officials is not something that I think people who become State Health Officials know about. Tell us about how that worked or you. What were some of the things you did that seemed to work?  Devlin: Well, in my work with elected officials, I always was grateful for their service. They stood for election. They made enormous sacrifices to be there with family and with the other careers. So, the fact that they stood for election was impressive to me. In working with them, I was very respectful of them. I was also very, and still am, very respectful of their role. And what my role is. And I was pretty clear in understanding that my role was to bring the Science on an issue. And, based on that Science, what my recommendation as a Scientist would be, State Health Official. But, recognizing that they have a different job. That they have a different set of factors that they are using to make their decisions. Whether it's constituent based; or the economics of a situation, they have other responsibilities. So, I'm there to give them my best guidance based on Science. When you get off on your Science it's just a greasy slide downwards. So, it's really important to stay there on your facts. And, moving into advocacy is tricky. There are others that can do that for you. So, working in partnership with others that are going in another way, another approach to do your advocacy work, usually that's going to be in my State the local health departments were independent. So, they can do that back home in their constituents, in the community or even in the legislature. The non-profit sector is a very good partner in that way as well. The other thing is, I always took someone there with me. So, you always had someone that made sure that everything was, what you heard when you leave is what you thought you heard. That you're not getting pushed into a deal. You never want to make a deal with a legislature. So, that third person, someone from your team, helps everybody stay on the path you meant to stay on when you went in there. So, it's little tricks like that.  Baker: So, an extra pair of ears there. There's someone else in the room with you that's listening at the same time.   ### State health officials share their greatest challenges as SHOs (Part 1)  Description of the video:  Baker: Now, you've mentioned to me before that the real challenges around preparedness, you just touched on that being a huge challenge, say a little bit more about if you would, that challenge. What was challenging about it perhaps, and how you really dealt with it? And, you've already touched on it, Leah. But, that was a big challenge for you, because you came into it at a particular point in time. Tell us a little bit about that important challenge for you?  Devlin: So, I did start as a State Health Director in May of 2001. So, the towers came down in September, and then the anthrax index case, the first man that was sick and died from anthrax was actually...was from Florida, but he got sick in North Carolina. So, we and Florida were the epicenter for that very first investigation of an act of bio-terrorism. And so, right out of the box we were going through hospital records and looking for where the exposure might have been, and whether anybody else might have been exposed. So, it was time of high risk; high concern, and we right away knew we had to ramp up not just the investigation, but communication with the public. Making sure that we were communicating in a timely; complete, and accurate way. Every day; every morning, every afternoon there would be a media either press release, a media availability, a press conference where we had all of our partners together, but that public face of, \"We've got this.\" Because, actually, it was a really great opportunity for us to eliminate actually, who we are in Public Health, what our role is. That for 100 years we've been investigation infectious diseases and detecting early and responding rapidly so that we can contain the damage done when there is an infectious disease in the community. Or, food borne outbreak, for example. So, we were able to demonstrate that there is a local health department in every County in our State. This is what they do. This is what we do. Now, it got a twist because it was intentionally delivered, and that's frightening, and brings new partners for us to work with. But, that we have the experts in the Science; the medicine, the epidemiology, we know the community, this is what we do. And that was a really strong and important message for the community, that really thought the Health Department was that clinic on the corner down the street. We were able to say, \"No, no. That's important. Some of us do that. Some of us don't.\" We do it in North Carolina. But, our community health protection role is foundational and we were able to demonstrate that.  Baker: It really opened people’s eyes to a whole different aspect of things.  Tilson: Great and specific and I thank you! Let’s get even more specific. Remind us what years you were in service as a State Health Officer.  Lumpkin: I was first appointed in 1990 and I left in 2003.  Tilson: During that time, you had so many challenges. Just name one issue that was among the most challenging, most exciting that you had to confront and talk about leadership lessons you’ve learnt in confronting it. Would you give us a specific of your experience as a SHO?  Lumpkin: My guess is that every State Health Official who was a State Health Official in 2001 would say that the events that happened on September 11 th and actually, subsequently in October with anthrax, was a wake-up moment. For me, it really was a culmination of the work that we had begun in the agency many years prior to that and it was sort of a validation of an approach. It was our major challenge. It’s hard to describe the environment when those first anthrax cases were reported, where we were getting calls from day-care centers. They were talking about, “Oh, we’ve discovered a white powder by the changing table.” Well, was anybody using baby powder? Someone got a letter full of white powder and we said, “Where did it come from?” “It came from my daughter.” “Did you ask her if she sent it?” “Oh…” When we went back, “Yes, she actually thought I didn’t have any baking powder, so she sent the recipe with the baking powder in the envelope.” There was a mass hysteria around this, but part of what our response was building upon the partnerships that we had built. Partnerships with the State Police who worked very closely with us around all the reports of white powder so that our laboratories were not overwhelmed, the ability of our laboratories to do the kinds of molecular biology to test whether or not these samples actually might have anthrax. All of that was based upon prior work and the ability to work with our Emergency Management Agency. That all put in place our ability to respond to this challenge by some of the work that we had done prior. For example, about three years before that, we had an activation of our State Emergency Operation Center. It was about 11 o’clock at night and we’re sitting in the center because there was a report of a laboratory that was found in one of the western suburbs of Chicago. It appeared to be a bio level four laboratory. We were sitting there with the Director of Emergency Operations Center, we had one of our employees who was trained because he had come in from a police background, a military background and how to use biohazard suits and they were entering the laboratory to try to determine what exactly was going on. We had the FBI on the launch pad at Quantico ready to come in and help out if we could in fact determine that this was a risk. As we were getting the description from our staff who was in there with signs on the wall that said, “Go! Bugs grow!” All of a sudden, something clicked in my mind. It had been an earlier investigation about fraud and it turns out that this actually had been a case that the Attorney General was investigating because they had a simulated bio level four lab and they were bringing in potential investors in this new innovation. When I brought those together and brought it to the Emergency Management Agency at one o’clock in the morning and the Head of the State Police at one o’clock in the morning, they began to realize. In fact, the Head of the Emergency Management Agency said that every disaster has a public health component. A week after September 11 th , we began to respond and I was sitting in the Emergency Operation Center. We knew each other’s names. You never want to get into a disaster situation and exchange business cards. You want to work with people you’ve worked with and solve things through. The second thing that we had done to prepare for that was recognize the importance of bio terrorism as a public health challenge, much as current public health officials or state health officials in 2017 have identified ahead of time the challenge of the opioid epidemic and to make plans in place and to recognize that you can’t always get funded when you think you have a need, but if you explore and put plans in place, when there’s an opportunity, you can actually get funded. We had wanted to expand our laboratory to include molecular biology and we had put it in our budget and the Bureau of the Budget said no and the Governor’s Office said no, and we put it in the budget the next year and the same answers. Then, there was an outbreak of invasive group A strep, also called “flesh-eating bacteria”, and it was in a small town in central Illinois and at that point, there were a lot of news and the Governor’s Office and the Bureau of Budget said, “What’s going to be our response?” My response was, “We need to expand our laboratory.” Half a million dollars immediately became available. We built in that molecular biology capacity. If I hadn’t been ready for that answer and I couldn’t say, “This is exactly how we spend it,” it would’ve been a missed opportunity and we would not have been available in 2001 to have that laboratory enable us to respond to the thousands white powder evaluations we had to do. It’s identifying where the challenges are, looking at opportunities and then, taking that opportunity when it presents itself to move forward the public health agenda.  Tilson: Give me just one most important challenge you faced in your time as state health officer, and then talk about leadership lessons learned and leadership you had to exert.  Selecky: Challenges come in many different shapes and forms. One of those challenges is a very large-print headline in the very important newspaper of the biggest town talking about the department of health as licensed to harm. I happened to have the responsibility to license all the state health officials, and there were some things that we didn't do well. That's a very humbling pill to swallow. To make sure that you've prepared the governor for that kind of headline was going to come, and hope that the governor would stick with you to go through the improvements that were needed. So that kind of challenge of managing the media, making sure the staff didn't lose their confidence in what we were doing, and then leading through the improvements that needed to go on was a huge, huge challenge.  Another one of the kinds of challenges is certainly everything that we faced after September 11th, 2001. We were not prepared as a system, and we will be better prepared every day that we work on it. But the coming together of state health officials across this nation and learning from our colleagues in the eastern states and Washington DC. Even though Seattle and Washington state were far away, we needed to be ready for things that we couldn't anticipate. Whether it was the H1N1 flu epidemic, we used the skills that we learned in preparedness. Whether it was when Fukushima blew up in Japan, and while it didn't impact the United States, the amount of fear that people had about radiation impacting them used every skill of risk communication, giving the public the kind of information they needed so that they would feel comfortable in trusting you that their health was okay. Those are challenges that are not easily defined, and you've got to have skill building and leadership building prior to that, to get through those challenges.  Tilson: You were state health officer in Indiana during a time when there were a lot of challenges in public health. Do you want to name one of your favorite challenge and talk about it a little bit?  Monroe: Well, I would tell you, on the national scale, as well as state and local, was H1N1. I was president of ASTHO, and I was state health officer, during the H1N1 pandemic. I found myself in a leadership role on multiple levels. We had a lot of challenges during H1N1. You know, the vaccine was supposed to be available at a certain time. Everyone had been assured. And then it was delayed. Messaging that was a major challenge. Getting folks to comply in the early days, before we had a vaccine. How do you get your public to begin to wash their hands and stay home when they're sick and use their sleeve to cough into? Communications, again, is just one of the things that was really needed to be able to overcome those challenges. Convincing the governor to stockpile, to mobilize resources.  At that time, we were talking about antivirals, and you have a strategic national stockpile on the national level, but there was opportunity for states to stockpile further for their amounts for their population. And I can remember having the conversation with the governor about mobilizing resources; in my case, a conservative state. But that happened, because at that time, that's what we felt like was one of the better things to do. School closings, oh my, that was a real challenge because there was, quite frankly, there was some delay in getting the guidance out from CDC, and you had all the school superintendents, I can remember there being some pretty tense moments, especially when in some jurisdictions there were reports of either teachers or students that were quite ill or deaths that were occurring during H1N1. There were challenges on multiple levels. And coordinating between the local communities, the state, and the federal is obviously something that needs to happen, but it happens many times behind closed doors.  I can remember one time with the school closings I had to make sure that the local health officer and the local school superintendent was aligned with the state and the governor and so forth. And we had multiple phone calls, for hours, the evening before, the morning before, to gain consensus. But when we all stood up shoulder to shoulder at the press conference, about two o'clock in the afternoon the next day, we were all aligned. And we got so much praise from the public because everyone saw that we were all on the same page and giving the same message.   ### State health officials share their greatest challenges as SHOs (Part 2)  Description of the video:  Baker: You mentioned challenges just now. As you look back, there must have been a very significant, maybe even the most important, challenge that you faced in your time as a state health director. Tell us a little bit about what you think maybe your most important challenge was.  Benjamin: I woke up one morning and discovered that we had really a huge deficit in our Medicaid program, primarily for the mental health side of our program. That was our biggest challenge when I was the state health officer. The real problem with that, of course, was that that had been my program which I had oversight for as the Deputy. The problems that I discovered as Secretary were ones, in many ways, that I created as Deputy. They were political problems, because there was a growing need for mental health services; it was a physical problem, because we had had… We had been blessed almost with six years of really good funding. That's when the economy was churning along. Now the economy was downturning. There was physical pressures, new problems with the Medicaid program primarily on mental health.  Baker: What about, John, challenges? You've mentioned to me a major challenge that you faced during your term as state health director. What would be an example of the most, really, greatest challenges for you during your tenure? And how did you address that?  Auerbach: The biggest challenge during my tenure as state health commissioner was a result of the fact that I was appointed right before the recession hit in 2008. That meant that year after year, the entire time I was state health commissioner, we were cutting the budget. In fact, we had eight rounds of layoffs. Eight. And each round of layoffs took months. Almost every single month that I was a state health commissioner, I was in the process of scaling back programs and laying people off. That took a lot of energy, distracted us from the work we wanted to be doing to promote good health. It created problems within the department around the overall morale, so we had to pay a lot of attention to building morale. And it also meant that people needed certain kinds of creative skills to be able to deal with those challenges and still keep their eye on the ball about what were the key public health issues we need to focus on. I would say overall the team of people did an outstanding job, but it wasn't easy.  Tilson: I want you to choose the toughest, biggest deal challenge as a state health officer. An event, emergency, something that really taxed you and taxed your leadership skills. Talk about that.  Harmon: Probably my confirmation.  In some of the press coverage leading up I said that tobacco control, reducing tobacco use was going to be one of my top priorities and the most powerful lobbyists in the state, in the legislature was the tobacco industry rep who also had other big accounts. Anheuser-Busch Beer, Monsanto Chemicals, so he was by far the most powerful. He objected to taking that on and almost blocked my confirmation.  Tilson: That will tax your leadership. Let’s talk about you as a leader. How does a leader confront that kind of situation?  Harmon: Well, I worked closely with the Governor’s Office and with my sponsor, a State Senator for my confirmation and worked through that, and told them I would use a rational approach and not get too carried away. Not try to move too fast and use a science-based approach so that they realized I wasn’t some kind of radical who must be stopped at the beginning. I was confirmed on the last day. They made me sweat.  Tilson: Let me segue to challenges. In addition to this leadership achievement, what is the greatest challenge that you've faced beyond that? Other things, so far, that have got big and taken a lot of your time. What would you name as the biggest challenge?  Nicole: Number one, by far, is human resources. [Laughs] And being able to understand what management skills are also important to have while focusing on being a leader. Understanding how to delegate, as well. And understanding how to motivate your staff, to incentivize those that are doing good and to hold accountable those that are not, all within variety of political environments that exist. Whether labor relations or a more conservative environment or more liberal, navigating all of that with a human resources system that sometimes has been overlooked over the years, because it's easy to eliminate or not invest in when money gets tight, has been one of the bigger challenges that's required the steepest learning curve, and has often times pushed me in terms of that emotional intelligence and being able to better assess: all right, so what's needed in the situation to navigate this barrier? How do we find the best in people to get the outcomes that we want?  Tilson: Let’s apply it.  Remind us where you were a State Health Officer and what years you served.  Halverson: I was the state health officer in Arkansas from 2005 to 2013.  Tilson: During that time you had a lot of challenges, some real doozies.  Just drill down on one.  What was the biggest challenge, the biggest issue that you faced in that time?  Halverson: Boy, that’s a really tough question. It seemed like every day was a new challenge. I often said that it was the best job that I ever had. Some days it was both the best and worst day that I’ve ever had. So I don’t know. I suppose that one of the biggest challenges was the challenge of demonstrating to the Governor and to the legislature the importance of public health as its own agency. You may know that when I came as the State Health Officer it was in the waning days of the Arkansas Department of Health and the organization was slated for consolidation to become part of the Department of Health & Human Services. There was this one guy that was the director of what was now the Department of Health & Human Services, John Selig, a terrific guy, a wonderful career person. Had primarily focused on children, Medicaid and it was a huge agency.  What happened was that public health became one of 13 divisions within the new Health & Human Services area. Despite all of our great intentions when the Governor says I need to have the top three issues for your agency and if your agency contained health and other things, sometimes it was competition to decide whether you would even get one thing that would be mentioned as a health issue. The idea was to save money by consolidating our Health Department with Human Services and so why wouldn’t we do that. Part of it was I don’t think people really understood the importance of health. So it was a good intention, great people that were trying to make it work, but over a relatively short period of time the legislature and our new Governor decided it was time to reverse course. Health was too important to simply be buried in an umbrella agency that didn’t have as its primary purpose protecting and improving the health of the public. I remember when the Governor, I talked with him and he said, “It’s too important.  You need to have a strong voice in supporting public health. I need to hear directly from you.  It needn’t be filtered. It’s important enough that in our state health is prominent as its own agency.” That was a challenge not just to me but to public health overall.  We were able to convince the Governor and the legislature in a way that was professional and respectful, but the importance of being our own agency. That set the stage then for a number of things that I’m quite proud of, including the passage of the tobacco tax increase which also at the same time occurred with the passage of legislation that substantially created the trauma system for our state. We were, I think, among the last states in the country to have an organized trauma system.  A trauma system that included not just the big city of Little Rock, but all of our state. I can’t help but believe that’s one of the most lasting things that occurred was the creation and the number of lives saved by essentially employing what we know about injury prevention and control. A lot of things went on that I’m quite proud of. A lot of work went on by some very talented people. It was my privilege to have worked with and creating an important team. Groups of teams that worked on a lot of different projects. There were a number of challenges but that’s just one.   ### Watch the full interviews of 11 state health officials who participated in the SHO-CASE Study  Participants include: Nicole Alexander-Scott, MD, MPH; John Auerbach, MBA; Georges Benjamin, MD; Leah Devlin, DDS, MPH; Jeffrey Engel, MD; Paul Halverson, DrPH, FACHE; Bob Harmon, MD; Douglas Lloyd, MD, MPH FACPM; John Lumpkin, MD; Judith Monroe, MD; and Mary Selecky.  Individual interviews with state health officials  Description of the video:  Tilson:              Hi, I'm Hugh Tilson, on the faculty of the Fairbanks School of Public Health and here for a project that Fairbanks, Indiana, School of Public Health is doing thanks to the funding from the de Beaumont Foundation and strong support from ASTHO. I'm here talking with you, Judy Monroe. It's wonderful to see you, as always. Thank you for joining us. The subject here is how to be successful as a state health officer. I can't think of anybody better to talk with, with that, than you, former state health officer for the state of Indiana.    Monroe:           Thank you. Good to be with you.    Tilson:              Glad you're here. Judy, let's start at the beginning. The subject is successful state health officers. What is your definition of a successful state health officer?    Monroe:           I have to tell you, Hugh, my definition of a successful state health officer is someone, to be honest, first and foremost, that enjoys the job and enjoys engaging with the public, and with the legislators, and with their governor and all the stakeholders, because I think that's one of the keys to success. Going from there, if you get those relationships well established and you're enjoying it, then you can take on the challenges. Honestly, as a state health officer you do want to see some policy advance. So that's one of the successes is if you've advanced really good public health policy in your state, which is not an easy thing to accomplish, by the way. If you get the stakeholders and the coalitions, begin to build coalitions or promote coalitions that have already been established that are actually doing good work, I think that's another characteristic of a successful state health officer.    Tilson:              Let's talk about the ingredients of that success, then. What are the attributes of a successful health officer? Describe one for me.    Monroe:           I think the first attribute is actually listening. When I was state health officer I found that regardless of whether it was the governor, the legislators or the constituents that would come with their issue that they wanted me to help advance, I would start by listening and trying to understand. I think then from there, when you're communicating as a state health officer, the ability to tell a good story. Story telling is honesetly, it's gold, regardless of which audience that you're speaking with, and marrying that with data. And making sure that as a state health officer, and this is something I did right of the gate, I made sure that all my audiences knew that I would be data-driven and that I would be seeking the best data available for the day, regardless of what the issue was. But if I really wanted to capture the imagination of any audience, I had to have a story. That's the way we've learned as human beings for a long time, and it makes a big difference.    Tilson:              Let's talk about challenges. You were state health officer in Indiana during a time when there were a lot of challenges in public health. Do you want to name one of your favorite challenge and talk about it a little bit?    Monroe:           Well, I would tell you, on the national scale, as well as state and local, was H1N1. I was president of ASTHO, and I was state health officer, during the H1N1 pandemic. I found myself in a leadership role on multiple levels. We had a lot of challenges during H1N1. You know, the vaccine was supposed to be available at a certain time. Everyone had been assured. And then it was delayed. Messaging that was a major challenge. Getting folks to comply in the early days, before we had a vaccine. How do you get your public to begin to wash their hands and stay home when they're sick and use their sleeve to cough into? Communications, again, is just one of the things that was really needed to be able to overcome those challenges. Convincing the governor to stockpile, to mobilize resources.    At that time, we were talking about antivirals, and you have a strategic national stockpile on the national level, but there was opportunity for states to stockpile further for their amounts for their population. And I can remember having the conversation with the governor about mobilizing resources; in my case, a conservative state. But that happened, because at that time, that's what we felt like was one of the better things to do. School closings, oh my, that was a real challenge because there was, quite frankly, there was some delay in getting the guidance out from CDC, and you had all the school superintendents, I can remember there being some pretty tense moments, especially when in some jurisdictions there were reports of either teachers or students that were quite ill or deaths that were occurring during H1N1. There were challenges on multiple levels. And coordinating between the local communities, the state, and the federal is obviously something that needs to happen, but it happens many times behind closed doors.    I can remember one time with the school closings I had to make sure that the local health officer and the local school superintendent was aligned with the state and the governor and so forth. And we had multiple phone calls, for hours, the evening before, the morning before, to gain consensus. But when we all stood up shoulder to shoulder at the press conference, about two o'clock in the afternoon the next day, we were all aligned. And we got so much praise from the public because everyone saw that we were all on the same page and giving the same message.    Tilson:              I wasn't about to step on that message. What a great story. Judy, translate that into leadership lessons that you've learned. That, as you were a leader, you were thrust into a real leadership position. For future state health officers that are going to be facing these same sorts of challenges, what leadership skills do you bring to that leadership?    Monroe:           I think the leadership skills, we could talk a long time about leadership skills because there are many. I think in being a good leader, part of it is reading the room or reading the situation, because there are times that humility is what is needed, there are other times when folks really need to see someone stand up and be a really strong leader, grounded in the data, and have a forceful message and using the bully pulpit. As state health officer there were times, especially during H1N1 or other outbreaks, when I would go in front of the cameras or go in front of audiences and I was very clear in my message. Other times, you need to step back, listen, and again have that humility.    Being able to lead different groups is quite a challenge for a state health officer, because in many ways you're trying to influence and convince your governor or your legislators of certain things that need to be done. And the next day you may find yourself in a small community meeting in a small town, in a rural community, that type of thing, so I do think it takes some flexibility. And reading the room would be one of the things. Good listening, good communication, strong communication so that it's very clear. Willingness to learn, I think that's a strong characteristic. A characteristic of a strong leader is being always willing to learn because there's always something new coming around. Even though you may have thought you had the answer, new data or new information may come in that actually there's maybe a better way to go about it.    Tilson:              I think I know too much about you.    Monroe:           [Laughs]    Tilson:              But I'd like you to talk out loud about integrity, trustworthiness.    Monroe:           I think as a leader trust is fundamental. When you are authentic and people trust you, you do get a lot more done. I found myself many times almost being surprised at some of the success, and what would come back to me would be messages that, no, the legislators trusted me, therefore they would allocate funding for whatever I was asking for or they would...it was helpful for passing certain laws, or the trust of the governor, the trust of the communities, the academic communities. That's the other thing as a state health officer, you need to have that trust at so many levels and so many audiences that are looking at you through a different lens. So, having integrity and building trust is key to the success of a state health officer.    Tilson:              You hadn't had prior experience in government when you started off as a state health officer, so let's scroll back to day one. What do you wish you had known on day one that you had to learn the hard way?    Monroe:           I did not have any experience in government prior to becoming state health officer. In fact, when the governor asked me would I consider being the state health officer, I had to go quickly and do some reading and talking to people to find out exactly what a state health officer did. I mean, what in fact was the job of the state health officer? I think coming in it would have been nice to have actually had a better and deeper understanding of the political process and just government in general. I had a basic understanding, but I certainly learned by fire very quickly.    Luckily, I also had legislators that took me under their wing. They made it clear to me that I was now in politics [Laughs] and that they were there to help and guide me, which I think actually paved the way for even more success because I was willing to be a good student of those that wanted to teach me.    Tilson:              Were there other aspects of the onboarding that were particularly useful to you or that you wish people had done but didn't? What do we need to tell people who are bringing new health officers on board about how to increase their likelihood of success?    Monroe:           When I think about my onboarding, coming in without having that prior experience in state government or even at the local level, I just really valued the outreach that I had from ASTHO. I think that mentoring relationship just is invaluable. I had been told by the individual that I came in behind, the person that I succeeded told me, \"Make sure you get involved with ASTHO very quickly.\" And that was the best advice, probably, I was given on day one in the job. I can remember thinking that the current state health officers that I started to meet in meetings or that I would hear on telephones, I thought, these people are brilliant, unbelievable the knowledge that they seem to have, because I was so new to the whole aspect of being a state health officer. But people reached to me. I had private phone calls. I had visits. That was probably the most valuable because, to be honest with you, there were very few people in the state that could help me—former state health officers. Some of them had approached the job differently than I wanted to. And so that was the other thing, too, I think knowing yourself. And I would put that high on the list for a leader, above all, know thyself and follow your own North Star, just be authentic. In doing that I started seeking out other state health officers that I would see characteristics in them that I wanted to be like or that I could see some of myself in.    The other things I looked for were, what were the priorities for my governor, what were the priorities for my state legislature? And then looking to state health officers that maybe had advanced those issues. Who'd been successful and how did they do it? I was very curious about the how. The other thing I would tell you is the State Health Leadership Initiative, that week of being with state health officers and being able to be in a learning environment with my new state health officers, my colleagues, was also an invaluable early experience that just served me...it serves me still today. I think back to the lessons I learned that week.    Tilson:              One of the things we're looking at in our study is the high turnover of state health officers, too many leaving too fast. Talk about your departure and what the experience with that was. You left fairly precipitously because you got a great job offer.    Monroe:           I did.    Tilson:              What did that do to the agency?    Monroe:           When I started as state health officer, I was there for five years which was a long enough tenure that I had really put my mark on both the State Health Department as well as the public health system in the state of Indiana. When I got this job offer and left to go to CDC, it was pretty abrupt. Surprised the governor, surprised the public health community that I was often running. With that I had put together certain structures that, after I left, some of those fell apart, quite frankly. Now there are some things I'd put in place that are still there today, and people remind me and that's celebrated. The one thing in government that is a bit distressing for me is that you don't really have the advantage to select your successor, so succession planning within the state is challenging in government. There were, especially for local public health departments, I think they felt my departure pretty acutely, and I heard that a lot. Part of that was just someone coming in behind me took a different approach, and I don't know that they felt as valued or heard the way they did when I established my relationship with them.    Tilson:              Advise new health officers about how to protect their agencies against the pain of turnover, in case they don't last five years.    Monroe:           Again, I think when new health officers come in they do need to take some time, and do it quickly, to listen to the various stakeholders, to find out what was valued and what worked, and to see if it's still politically viable. Because if you come out too quickly with messages to, say, your local health department, the local health officers, or it could be to the academic community or so forth, you may find yourself having a troubled start because the person that preceded you may have put some things in place that have a high value. Now, you need to make them your own. And that's one of the challenges of the job, you want to put your own stamp on things and make them your own, but don't throw the baby out with the bath water. That happened for a couple of things after I left, which I did hear quite a bit about.    Tilson:              Can you insulate the agency against that kind of turnover trauma? Particularly for the short tenure health officers, the ones who only make it two and half years, say, what can they do?    Monroe:           That's a great question and it's one that I think we all need to give a lot of thought to. Part of that can be done by having a strong executive team, I think, at the health department. I think the deputies play an incredible role, as well as the others that might be on that executive team. Anyone that may come in and know that they're going to be there for a short time, and a longer term as well, but especially the short term, they do need to be conscious of that, that there needs to be some sustainability and buffering the agency against the trauma of them leaving. I think I'd turn to my deputies.    Tilson:              I don't want to miss the chance to talk particularly with you about the relationship between state health officers and the CDC. Help our SHO's to understand how to use the CDC, and maybe vice versa.    Monroe:           First of all, when I came in as state health officer, to be honest, I was pretty wowed that I got to work with CDC. It's such a great brand, both domestically and worldwide. I had been a practicing physician, so coming in it was like, this is really cool, I get to work to CDC. As I started to work with the CDC, though, I found that I wasn't always getting what I needed directly from CDC. In my case, I was asked to go to CDC to establish an office of state, tribal, local and territorial support, OSTLTS. That is your home at CDC. Any new state health officer, not only would I advise quickly getting involved with ASTHO but you want to be known by OSTLTS also, because OSTLTS is the inside game at CDC, and we really built that office to be the home for state health officers, as well as locals that come in, as well, but especially for the state health officers. That means establishing a relationship with the director, currently José Montero, but there's a tremendous staff there.    What we did when state health officers would have a particular need, whether that was trying to advance policy or whether that was data needs or whether that was just they needed the experience or they needed...maybe things weren't working as well in a particular program that they needed some support, they can call OSTLTS and OSTLTS will help navigate either connecting them to the right people, problem solving, what have you. We did a number of things on behalf of the state health officers. It's a really important relationship. State health officers and CDC need one another, and they need to learn, they need to continually learn from one another, as well.    Tilson:              You bring another... You have so many things to bring to this table. We don't have all day but just in the next exchange, please think out loud about the relationship between public health and private medicine.    Monroe:           The relationship between public health and private medicine is one that quite frankly has intrigued me my entire career. I think we miss opportunities all the time with private medicine and public health. That's, when we think about the leadership of state health officers and what they can bring to the table, is forging a strong relationship with the Hospital Association at the state level and then with CEO's.    A quick story. I was state health officer. Had been state health officer in Indiana two or three years by this point. There was something I had a question about, and I started calling CEO's of hospitals. And I called one particular CEO in a moderate-sized town who'd been the CEO of this hospital for 30 years, and he said, \"This is the first time a state health officer has ever picked up the phone to talk to me,\" and he was thrilled. He was thrilled with the call. We ended up probably talking an hour. We covered all kinds of issues. He became one of the greatest advocates for public health during my tenure and after. Picking up the phone, talking at that top leader, the state health officer, the beauty—and I love this part of the job—was that quite frankly anybody would take my phone call. CEO's of companies, CEO's of hospitals, it didn't matter, as the state health officer, folks would take your call because they knew you worked for the governor and they had an interest in that. Use that wisely because we need to forge more relationships. And then if it's starting at the top, then you can engage the local health officer to work with the local hospitals and with the medical staff.    One of the things I did as state health officer is I started very strategic communications out to all licenses professionals. And it would depend, sometimes it would only be to the physicians, sometimes it would be to the pharmacists, nurses and so forth. Some other state health officers have followed suit with that. That's another bully pulpit opportunity that state health officers have. If new state health officers are coming into the job and that's not established in your state, seize that opportunity, but be strategic about it. You don't want to overwhelm the practicing physicians with communications.    Actually, we started a medicine and public health day. It was the Indiana...it was the commissioner's public health and medicine day. I actually got the residency programs to close down for the day, have the faculty cover their patients, and we'd bring residents in to highlight all the things that had happened in public health in Indiana for a year. Looking back in the year before, what were the issues that medicine should care about, that public health had been managing, and those kinds of things. It was a really robust and fun day. So, you can be creative with it.    Tilson:              Let's do one more of those exchanges. Let's now blue sky. Public health is an extraordinary field. Things are changing rapidly. What do you think the greatest opportunity looking forward is? Where are we going here that public health needs to embrace?    Monroe:           If I get blue sky about where public health needs to go, I'm going to put on my current hat, because I'm now president and CEO of the CDC Foundation, and I've spent the last year and a half working with large companies and large associations that I'd never even heard of before, that are in various industries. When I think about the entrepreneurs and the new technologies and all of these things that are emerging, we need those folks to be champions of public health. We need to be more innovative in public health, and to do that we need to talk to people who are innovators. I will tell you, there are communities out there that think differently, that would serve us well both ways. So, I'm beginning to do some of that in my role at the foundation, and I think there's huge opportunity there.    Tilson:              And then finally, speak to the alumni. What can ASTHLO alumni do to help public health?    Monroe:           ASTHO alumni are, what a treasure. They have gone... Life after being a state health officer takes so many shapes and forms. I've talked to fellow alumni that have gone into pharmaceutical companies and philanthropy and various businesses, it's very cool. I think the alumni need to be a strong force. They can be a voice, they've got the freedom now. Most of them have the freedom to speak up. They can write op-eds, they can be on the Hill, they can get with their legislators in their own state or jurisdictions to help carry the message. They can be incredible mentors to those coming up through the ranks. I would call on all alumni to be incredible active and use their talents and their experience to advance public health.    Tilson:              Unbelievable how quickly the time flies, Judy. You also have the bully pulpit here with the microphone and the camera.    Monroe:           [Laughs]    Tilson:              Is there anything you want to say to ASTHO or your fellow state health officers?    Monroe:           Just a huge thank you. I just give a huge shout out to ASTHO for all that they've done for 75 years. They've been quite a force, and they need to continue to grow and even be stronger. My colleagues across the field at all levels, I've had such a privilege of meeting so many remarkable people, and it's just a big thank you from me.    Tilson:              Judy Monroe meets remarkable people because she is a remarkable person. Thank you so much for doing this for us, Judy. Appreciate your coming.    Return to SHO-CASE homepage "

    "body": "  ## Alex Simonton   ### MHA Class of 2017    Alex Simonton joined the Indiana Hospital Association in August 2015 as a patient safety intern. While working to improve patient safety and quality throughout the state, she knew she wanted to broaden her experience in a clinical setting.  As luck would have it, a new managerial role was created at the IU Student Outreach Clinic. As the new Co-Clinic manager, Simonton provides oversight to student volunteers during the clinic’s operating hours. Though this role is a significant time commitment, Simonton says that she enjoys her contribution to the community.  “We serve a vulnerable patient population and it is fulfilling to see students working together to provide comprehensive care to people who, prior to the clinic, sought primary care in the emergency departments of local hospitals,” she said.  Simonton’s responsibilities don’t end with serving the patient population. She has developed marketing strategies to increase patient awareness of clinic resources. She is also working to standardize clinic practices, including new volunteer orientation, and streamlining check-out processes for patients and volunteers. “We are working on a volunteer portal to centralize information and better track volunteer demographics,” she said.  Interprofessional collaboration among the clinic’s volunteers is another priority Simonton has set for herself. “The opportunity for students to be involved in a free clinic that features several disciplines is a great learning experience; students are able to practice their craft and work in a care team,” she said.  “Our aim as part of the management team is to prepare students to recognize and value the strengths and responsibilities of other professions so that patient-centered care can be delivered in a collaborative manner. My experience at the IU Student Outreach Clinic has been fantastic and full of lessons that I can apply in the pursuit of my ultimate career goal, to lead a hospital system as an executive. I truly enjoy working with all of the dedicated volunteers and strive to enhance their clinic experience so that they can provide excellent care to patients.”  Simonton is a second-year MHA student and will graduate in May 2017.

    "body": "  ## Alumni career profile: Luz Machuca  BSPH in Community Health, 2019  During the summer following her freshman year at IUPUI, Luz Machuca traveled abroad to Salamanca, Spain for six weeks. There, she met Haley, a student enrolled at the IU Richard M.  Fairbanks School of Public Health who was majoring in community health. After talking with her new friend, Luz wanted to learn more.  “She gave me a brief overview of community health that made me investigate and do my own research,” Luz said. “I loved that community health was such a broad field and you could take different paths in the actual job/career you decided upon. It was not a cookie cutter major.”  When Luz returned to the states, she went to talk with Leah, an undergraduate academic advisor at the Fairbanks School of Public Health, and she enrolled as a pre-community health major.  “After a few classes, I knew I was on the right career path – although my friends and family did not really understand what I was going to be doing after college,” said Luz, who said finding the right major was not easy.  “Being a first-generation student who grew up on the east side of Indianapolis, and attended IPS schools, I was not really exposed to the number of careers out there or majors that I could major in. I knew about the common career choices like nursing, dentistry, law, and business, but I had never heard about community health or public health Feeling overwhelmed, lost, and confused on what to major in, I entered IUPUI as an undecided major.”  While at IUPUI, Luz took advantage of many experiential opportunities. She traveled abroad twice, both to Spain and Nicaragua, where she was able to develop her Spanish fluency and interact with people of different cultural backgrounds. She also participated in a spring break alternative trip that IUPUI offers, during which she learned how to live without a cellphone or running water for a week.  During one spring break, she took a three-day cultural tour in Cincinnati, Ohio and Detroit, Michigan that was offered by the Diversity Enrichment and Achievement Program, and TRIO Student Support Services Program at IUPUI.  “During this trip, I learned a lot more on how African-American slaves were brought against their will to this country and the horrible experiences they lived through during their voyage to the U.S., as well as their experiences once they arrived. This cultural tour offered me in-depth information about American history that is not thoroughly taught in school.  Luz was able to job shadow during her last year at Fairbanks, which led her to find a summer internship that would fulfill her last requirement for earning her bachelor’s degree in public health.  After graduating in 2019 with a BSPH in Community Health, she started a paid summer internship at the Youth Diabetes Prevention Clinic. In her new role, she assists with recruiting, planning, implementation, and evaluation of a new community diabetes prevention program. She also does data entry for participants and facilitates health education sessions.  “My degree is directly correlated with my current summer internship because I am evaluating, planning, and implementing an actual community health program for a priority population,” Luz said.  Luz is excited to start gaining experience in the field of public health. Her long-term career goal is to pursue a master’s degree in public health or business. She believes having a background in public health and earning a Master of Business Administration can make her more versatile and well-rounded.  “I like to go with the flow of life and see where it takes me, but I know that I will pursue higher education in the future.”    Wondering what you can do with a public health degree? Through the BSPH in Community Health, students gain knowledge, research skills and hands-on domestic and international experience that prepares them to tackle real-world problems. With such high demand and potential job growth for professionals with health-related degrees, it is an exciting time to be in the public health sector. We’re currently facing extraordinary challenges, but we have the unique opportunity to transform the health of people in Indiana and beyond. Whether you’re interested in pre-medicine, pre-dentistry, or pre-nursing programs, or a health career not bound to just hospitals, our BSPH—Community Health program can help you get there.

Individuals working in health administration manage and lead aspects of care delivery in settings such as hospitals and clinics. They also work in companies and organizations that impact healthcare including insurance, medical device, and pharmaceutical companies.  People working in public health and health administration are often the silent heroes behind the scenes, supporting policies such as smoke-free indoor air or improving the hiring process to address the nursing shortage.
