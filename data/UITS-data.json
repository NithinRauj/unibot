    "body": "  ## 2021 UITS User Survey IUK – Open Text Responses (Edited)  This text file includes responses to the following question of the UITS survey:  (At start of the survey): As you get started, please take a moment to share with us any thoughts, concerns, issues, and/or ideas that you may have. What positive experiences with UITS staff or services have you had? Are there concerns or negative interactions that you want us to know about? Do you have recommendations for new services or improvements to existing ones? (You will have a chance to review, amend, or add to your comments before submitting your responses.)  (At end of the survey): If you entered comments at the beginning of the survey, they are displayed below. If you would like to edit your comments, share recommendations for additional services and support resources, or add additional comments or suggestions please enter them below.  The responses are listed by respondent case number. Case numbers, in which the respondent did not leave any text, are not included.  Identifying references have been removed from this document and replaced with “[IRD]”. Responses are grouped by sample: Faculty, Staff, Undergraduate students, and Graduate students.   ### Faculty responses:  My experiences with UTIS staff have been positive overall. While the process to request things like web services is time-consuming and a little cumbersome, the staff have been prompt in processing my requests and completing the work and have been very helpful overall. I have also had good luck with staff fixing problems in my classroom and taking care of issues with my school-issued laptop.  I asked for a microphone several times for use in class and was never given one so I purchased my own so students could hear me. As far as the technology support overall, it is generally good. Though I still have had some sound issues in the classroom I teach in.  More training and support for staff at non-Bloomington/ IUPUI campuses.  Be creative in supporting faculty, especially in non-Bloomington/IUPUI campuses with cutting edge technology which fits the budget. Example: do not hawk 10 year old monitors for 50$ a piece!  There have been some interactions with student associates that have come off as rude and demeaning. But the other UITS staff where I work are helpful and kind.  Some of my issues relate to having a MacOS, and I don't feel most of the time that UITS is equipped to help with this OS and should be. There are also issues with Exchange and Mac, for example, I don't have a button on my Mac Exchange for Phishing and I have to forward the email instead. Not that this is a huge deal but it is one example of the issues that we have with Mac and accessing what we need to at the university.  I've found the staff to be very friendly and helpful.  The response time was phenomenal. Thank you for doing an excellent job.  I would like an IT person assigned to various departments    similar to how librarians are assigned to given areas. I would like to be able to direct students to a specific person who is familiar and aware of the technology being used in my courses.  UITS has always been a primary part of my courses at all IU campuses on which I have taught courses.  Our campus staff are really responsive.   ### Staff responses:  The full-time UITS staff are consistently prompt and helpful. While the students who work at the Help Desk are courteous, it often feels like they don't have the training or experience required to assist students and faculty. In the past the Help Desk has been staffed by students who seemed to have stronger client/customer service skills, so I'm not sure if the issue is with hiring or training.  Working in faculty support, my job often depends on faculty success in technology, so if the IT side of the faculty issue is an issue, I need UITS to either take over or assist. IUK's UITS group is awesome for this. They are knowledgeable and dependable. I greatly appreciate their services because they along with our department make a great team to support our faculty.  Our local IT support is amazing and typically very prompt to address issues. What I dislike is when I am sent to Bloomington and get voicemail. Sometimes my issue may be urgent due to being in the [IRD]'s office. I recommend giving me and the [IRD] a phone number to text someone who may be able to provide quicker service.  I appreciate the helpdesk assistance that I have received working from home.  One of my most recent interactions was about an update we needed to make to a web page. We needed to update a PDF that is on the web. We made changes to the form, but there were additional issues (accessibility) that needed to be updated as well. We attempted to make the changes in our office by looking at the links that IT staff provided to us as well as by googling on the web to resolve the issues. There were numerous emails back and forth with IT because we thought we had fixed the issues, but then we were told no we hadn't. Being sent webinars on how to resolve the issues did not help. It was extremely frustrating for me to have to try and figure out how to fix the form when I was already inundated with my \"normal\" work.  Another frustration I have is that I use OnBase pretty frequently. There have been times when I've had issues in OnBase, and I've reached out to IT, and they seem more confused or not as knowledgeable about OnBase. I know not everyone uses OnBase, but if there were someone on our campus that had further training in OnBase that would be extremely helpful. I've had other people that use OnBase ask me how to resolve questions or issues they have with OnBase because they couldn't get help from IT.  One positive experience I have from the last year with IT was when I was notified that my email account had been hacked and that I needed to change my passphrase. The notifications were extensive, and it was helpful that the service member reached out to me and my supervisor to make sure I knew I needed to change my passphrase. It was also easy at the helpdesk to get it changed.  I also think that IT sends out too many emails. I appreciate that they keep us updated with what things are changing or what things will be upcoming, but I feel like they send these emails, or a variation of the email, every week. I try really hard to read all the emails, but it is often overwhelming to try and read all the emails and know what is most important (like migrating to new servers or services). Often things that will be impactful to our office and campus as a whole are not noted as such in these emails.  In response to the next questi, yes, I would be willing to participate, but unfortunately with my current workload there is not a way that I would be able to participate.  The UITS staff on our campus (IUK) are outstanding. They respond quickly, are helpful and kind.  I have been very pleased by the support of our local UITS team, especially during the pandemic.  The UITS staff at the Kokomo campus are an amazing group of hard working individuals. I personally have contact with [IRD] and his crew on a daily basis, and it is always a pleasure. I don't think the campus understands how hard they work to create a positive experience for everyone on campus. I work in Facilities, and whenever we as a group are on campus getting everything ready for students [IRD] and his team are here as well. The challenges that they faced to be ready for students in 2020 were just as extreme as the facilities department, and they met the challenge above and beyond.  Yes. I feel new services are sprung on us without any training or preparation. You may understand all the jargon explaining what you are doing, but I don't. Perhaps have someone who knows little about technology read the content of your emails. For example, the switch from iuk.edu to iu.edu? All the old iuk addresses still populate when names are enetered in email; why not just delete them from the system once they have been updated? Plus, I have four different devices and had to call UITS to find out how to update each one inidviudally. Which they did help me with, but still, isn't there an easier way?  Communication between UITS and the campus community could improve. I feel that this migration, although we received info on it, has been a tough transition, and it isn't over yet.  IU Kokomo’s UITS team were very helpful and sensitive to my frustrations during the recent migration. Working remotely I had several issues. IT were more than accommodating, using the computer remote technique to get me set up.   ### Undergraduate responses:  No, everything available is accessible and easy to use.  No  The one positive experience I’ve had with UITS at IU Kokomo was help resetting my password for one.iu.  I love UITS on campus. I have worked individually with [IRD] and [IRD] from my freshman year to my senior year. They have helped so much from getting my laptop set up to helping me out with other small issues on my computer. They were so helpful, nice, and accommodating! In addition, [IRD] and [IRD] have been Johnny on the spot with issues technology-wise in the classroom!  So far everything has been thorough, straight forward, and friendly staff.  I have had very positive experiences with UITS staff. They did a wonderful job welcoming me to campus as a freshman and setting up everything I needed on my laptop.  I do not have any concerns at this time.  All experiences with IT have been positive and I greatly appreciate the option to contact them directly and receive immediate assistance. If my questions or problems have not been able to be taken care of right away, IT has always followed up quite quickly and resolved the issue.  When I first went to UITS I got great service; the staff was very friendly and very helpful.  I had a good experience with the staff when I went to an appointment to have software downloaded onto my laptop. They were knowledgeable and nice.  All IT experiences that I have had have been satisfactory. I appreciate that the staff members not only help find solutions but also show me how to fix the problem so I can learn more about my device.  I do sometimes have issues with Duo login as it does not always remember my information. Logging in quickly is not always an option.  A good experience I had with UITS is when I was locked out of my duo mobile login. I was able to get back into my account in a timely manner.  I will admit some bias up front as I work for UITS [IRD] as a helpdesk consultant and student technician. Overall I think our people try very hard with their work, especially over the past year where we were very understaffed for the amount of work to do. Everyone is usually very helpful and cooperative.  For our campus, I think our physical setup for Crimson Cards is rather lacking. As it stands taking online photos and asking for pickups works fine, but if we had to take a photo in person there is no way to maintain physical distancing. Taking a photo also involves having the person come into the office and making sure our screens have no sensitive information on them. Lastly, it aesthetically looks like a stopgap solution instead of a professional one. I think making and distributing cards could be made better if we had a better setup.  I think this survey is outdated when it asks about IU Secure, as we already should be on eduroam. Ever since moving to eduroam I think the wireless network on campus has been great; I personally have never had slow connections on it.  For our support center, we are presently understaffed, and bringing in new people would assuredly help. I don't mind the hit-the-ground-running style of the place, but aside from introductory training we really don't get anything in the way of follow-up training or formal training for any new issues. Usually when a new thing comes along (like the exchange migrations recently), we usually get a heads up and then have to figure it out as we go. I do not know if IUB and IUPUI have more formal training or not, just an observation.  I don't have any concerns or comments for you, but the times I've used this resource, it's been helpful  Everyone is always very nice. Quick and efficient as well  I didn’t have any issues. They IT guys are always helpful when I need them.  i have had nothing but pleasant experiences with the staff and the services provided! i have always been able to get an appointment to get everything fixed i need to!  I called recently with an issue of not being able to reach a certain page on my laptop because my sync wasn't on and it was throwing error messages. Even though it took a little bit of time, the woman that helped me got it to where my computer worked and I got to the page I needed to get to.  It would be nice if UITS was open later than 5pm, because a lot of times I don't get to an assignment until around that time.  I have had many positive services with UITS staff. The one that I remember the most is when I got my computer for my first semester and I emailed [IRD]. He helped me set up my computer through Zoom, and it took about 4 hours. He was very nice and talked me through every step and helped me download the things I needed for my major.  I have always felt as though I was able to have any questions answered in a timely manner. Additionally, my interactions with the workers has always been very helpful.  No.  No  No bad comments. Any issue i had was resolved right away.  I have never really had any experiences with the UITS staff.  The staff is super helpful and nice. They seem to take their time and get the jobs done. No complaints or recommendations.  The people providing the services are very nice.  Overall great service! One suggestion would be to add a free security software program like Mcafee or Norton. One issue I have is with making another IU account; I found it hard to understand how to make an account for IUPUI when I transfer there from IUK next semester.  There were times I felt the staff was not as nice as I thought, but they were helpful.  I've had nothing but positive experience. Everybody helps me get what i need to have a successful year.  I just don't know what all I can go to UITS for. Once, I had an issue with my macbook, but they said the only thing I could do is go to Apple to fix it. I guess I just don't know the limitations of UITS and when to and not go in for an issue I have.  N/A  All good so far.  A positive experience that I had was that my IT staff made sure I had everything I needed set for my education. The day he was aiding in setting up my laptop, Office was not working through IU. He checked until it was fixed and didn’t care the time; he was determined to make sure I had them on my laptop. The only improvement is that the services would be back on campus and not virtually.   ### Graduate responses:  Given the pandemic, I was very impressed with the IT help I received in setting up my computer. It was done over Zoom, and the man I worked with was very professional and patient with my slow internet.  I think the services offered from the UITS staff is an amazing perk of attending IUK. It saves students time and money and still allows for us to have programs needed and up to date technology to be able to perform successfully in our courses.  I think the system for signing up for classes and paying bills, etc. should be much more streamlined. There's multiple interfaces and redundancies, and it's also quite non-intuitive at times. The new interface for the course search is nice; perhaps the rest could be designed to work with that.  I seem to have difficulties when I need to log on to the wireless service on campus and often have to use guest login. "

    "body": "  ## 2021 UITS User Survey IUN – Open Text Responses (Edited)  This text file includes responses to the following question of the UITS survey:  (At start of the survey): As you get started, please take a moment to share with us any thoughts, concerns, issues, and/or ideas that you may have. What positive experiences with UITS staff or services have you had? Are there concerns or negative interactions that you want us to know about? Do you have recommendations for new services or improvements to existing ones? (You will have a chance to review, amend, or add to your comments before submitting your responses.)  (At end of the survey): If you entered comments at the beginning of the survey, they are displayed below. If you would like to edit your comments, share recommendations for additional services and support resources, or add additional comments or suggestions please enter them below.  The responses are listed by respondent case number. Case numbers, in which the respondent did not leave any text, are not included.  Identifying references have been removed from this document and replaced with “[IRD]”. Responses are grouped by sample: Faculty, Staff, Undergraduate students, and Graduate students.   ### Faculty responses:  UITS have always been in our work in the Writing Center. They respond promptly, and their questions are generally on target in resolving the problem. The redesign of computer spaces in the Writing Center was very helpful.  I just want to say that I think UITS has been pretty amazing this year. I don't know about the other campuses, but the IUN team has gone far and beyond what I expected.  UITS is one of the high points of being employed at IU. The services provided are exceptional. Everything almost always works as it should and makes my job easier. The one problem point I am currently experiencing is checking my employee Outlook email through the web-based application on my phone. Every time I attempt to login that way I am informed my inbox does not exist. Another thing I have noticed is that the eDossier system is extremely slow to load a dossier for review. It would be nice if it could be speeded up.  I have had a few problems with opening emails. UITS was right there to help me with all the issues. I appreciate the time they spent with me. Last semester, I had a student that had difficulty navigating Canvas saying that I locked her out of the modules. The student called UITS and sent me an email with the ticket number. I then proceeded to call UITS, worked with someone, and she said that she would contact the student directly, that everything looked fine on my end. She did as she said she would and everything seemed better after that.  Usually I have positive interactions with UITS staff. The only area I have a concern with is the software that is no longer offered on IU anyWare that is usually replaced with an inferior alternative.  I have used support often. Sometimes response can take a while.  I prefer UITS staff on my campus. It is discouraging when I call and am forwarded to the Bloomington campus for help. The Bloomington campus is less familiar with our specific technical needs.  They are always helpful.  I've heard students have had a great experience getting connected with Zoom in a timely manner. This is much appreciated!  I have had positive experiences with UITS staff helping answer questions and fix problems.  IT staff have consistently been helpful whenever contacted.  UITS has been a tremendous ally over the last year. My requests and interests are responded to with urgency and positivity.  Very responsive and polite team.   ### Staff responses:  I have had nothing but excellent interactions with the IT staff on day-to-day issues; even the migration from Box to the cloud drives went so much better once we were able to work with our local IT staff and move away from the downstate people (that wasn't rolled out very well in terms of training, imo). I have two central concerns: one is the proliferation of apps and new systems and the lack of any real training for those new platforms; it seems most of the trainings consist of not much more than self-tutorials which feels really inefficient. Secondly, we have SO MANY programming needs on our campus - so much need for systems to talk to each other, and finding real programmers who will address those issues is impossible. We spend countless hours trying to develop little apps on our own via excel that it is really, really frustrating. Oh, yes, and one more thing: all of those apps in Decision Support? None of them are really useful in that they are too narrowly defined, and it is really difficult to download anything to put into presentations. How about strengthening the good ol IUIE? I love the IUIE and would welcome more flexible reports there where we can choose parameters and download second- generation data! Tableau kind of sucks.  The service I have always received has been exceptional! The only request I would make is to have the person who is answering the phone identify themselves if they are not from our home campus. Example: I called UITS at IU Northwest. Because of their high call volume, I was \"sent\" to Bloomington, which I did not immediately recognize. The caller had the same name as an IUN Support Team Member, so I started by asking questions about their family and how they were doing. It took me a few minutes to realize I was not talking to the person I knew.  I have found the UITS staff very helpful and the service great.  [IRD] has been an asset this year to IU Northwest Athletics and Student Activities. She has helped us transfer and move files from Box to OneDrive and showed us how to use it. She also helps with any questions I may have.  Institutional data are helpful. (e.g. Data Handling & Sharing DSH tool, Data Classification Matrix, IDS Checklist, Critical Data Guide, KB, etc.) should be easier to locate and easier to share for part-time employees (easier for them to understand).  Skype has been very helpful and useful. For the phone system, I am concerned during a power outage that we cannot call out to university police or other offices.  All of my dealings with UITS have been positive; they are responsive and always willing to help as needed.  IUN UITS is a wonderful team overall. They always go above and beyond when assisting with issues, no matter how big or small. One suggestion i would add would be to offer a designated person to handle senior leadership issues. I realize all are available to help; however, when urgent matters come up, it would be helpful to have a connect that handles these types of calls for the Executive Administration.  I am extremely satisfied in general.  No comments at this time.  I have had nothing but great experiences with UITS  UITS staff is helpful and always quick to solve problems. The staff is courteous and patient.  Would like to have more assistance with web page management content--a bit more user friendly training.  IT has been very responsive to requests for assistance. I am very disappointed that UITS has decided to no longer make Mathematica, Maple etc. available to instructors and their students free of charge.  [IRD] and his team are always open to work with us on any of the areas we are in need of-- moving computers etc. We recently were trying to move through many rooms in the Arts & Science area and Raintree doing floor work. This requires removing all items from the room to strip and wax. Although we ran into many snags on which ones we could get in, we were able to complete many due to the awesome help we got from the UITS team. Even when we were not able to completely get to some that they had moved faculty lectures out of, they were very polite and understanding. We will try to do a better job planning ahead for their sake so that it will run smoother for them also on their end so they will not have to return or have the confusion we may have caused. [IRD] was very understanding and offering anything his team could do to help in anyway. Great Job to them all.  On some of the questions I put somewhat agree is not to the fault of UITS but my own understanding of computers.  I typically have positive experiences with UITS staff.  I've been happy with UITS staff and services.  I have not had any negative interactions with UITS staff or services; all have been positive experiences. Always willing to assist and prompt in providing services when needed.   ### Undergraduate responses:  I haven’t had any experience so, I believe that they are doing a good job.  No issues, all good.  I have had nothing but great experiences with UITS Staff.  All the staff have been very helpful with directions and helping me transition into my first semester.  N/a  I have not experienced any negative interactions at IU.  N/A  I don't have any thoughts, concerns, or ideas. I haven't had a lot of experience with the UITS staff or services, so I haven't had any negative impressions of them. I did get help at the beginning of the fall 2020 term because something happened while I was taking a test, and they were able to solve the problem for me, and afterward, I was able to retake it. I use the services provided, like Zoom, Gmail, and others pretty much every day, as well. So any impressions that I do have are only positive.  I have not had any interactions with anyone from UITS.  All interactions have been positive. I have no recommendations at this time.  I have only had one experience with the IT department, and it was a very pleasant exchange. She helped me figure out what was going wrong, and she was very polite! I have not been a student on campus in many years, as I am currently enrolled in all online classes. But the campus has always been well-staffed and easily accessible in regards to computer and technology access. Any issues I have ever experienced have been quickly resolved with help from staff.  When my teachers post to Kaltura, it takes forever for them to actually post to Canvas. Last semester, it was taking days for it to post to Canvas for me to see.  No negative feedback.  None at this time.  I appreciate the technology resources available at IUN. The only comment I have is that when researching topics for the school of education, it can be difficult to find relevant articles.   ### Graduate responses:  I have had nothing but great experiences with UITS. Not only are my problems addressed in a timely fashion, but everyone who works there is so professional and friendly. I feel comfortable bringing my tech problems to them. Cant say enough good things about this department!  I once called the IT department to help me gain access to my email address. They were very kind and helped me fix my problem very quickly!  Very friendly, accessible, and helpful "

    "body": "  ## 2021 UITS User Survey Summary IU East (IUE)   ### Brief guide to understanding the data  The UITS User Survey is administered by the Center for Survey Research. Surveys were sent to 876 randomly selected people at Indiana University East (70 Faculty, 38 Staff, 707 Undergraduate students, 61 Graduate students). Please note that respondents who reported that they did not use UITS systems or services (see Question 1) were not asked any additional questions and were removed from the results presented here.  The questions on the survey are primarily Likert opinion scales (1-5 rating scales with 5 being the most favorable rating). Responses to open-ended questions are not presented here. The results include:  For the average opinion and the satisfaction/importance/agreement scores, confidence intervals are provided. The confidence intervals indicate the sampling error for each estimate at the 95% confidence level. Average opinion and satisfaction/importance/agreement scores and their associated confidence intervals are not reported if they are based on fewer than 25 respondents. For categorical response questions that do not involve ratings such as whether the student lives in University housing or preferred method(s) of communications from UITS, data are not reported for the full question if they are based on fewer than 25 respondents and data are not reported for a particular category if at least one (1) but fewer than five (5) respondents selected the category. Data that are not reported are indicated by “N/A”. “Not Applicable/Do Not Use” responses were removed prior to the calculation of estimates, except for usage rates. Missing data were excluded from estimates as well.  This summary includes data from 84 people who participated in the survey (22 Faculty, 14 Staff, 44 Undergraduate students, 4 Graduate students). Results were weighted to reflect the total counts of those employed by the university (Faculty and Staff, combined) and students (Undergraduate and Graduate students, combined) at IUE in the fall of 2020. This helps to correct for overrepresentation of some subpopulations (for example, staff) and underrepresentation of others (for example, students) among those who chose to respond to the survey by bringing their representation in line with the total counts in the overall IUE population. Sampling error estimates account for weighting of the data.  It is important to note that some services are only used by specific subpopulations, so questions were only asked to those groups. Subpopulations of users are indicated by FAC for faculty, STF for staff, GRD for graduate students, and UND for undergraduate students.   ### General Services  1.

    "body": "  ## 2019 UITS User Survey IUK – Open Text Responses (Edited)  This text file includes responses to the following question of the UITS survey:  (At start of the survey): As you get started, please take a moment to share with us any thoughts, concerns, issues, and/or ideas that you may have. What positive experiences with UITS staff or services have you had? Are there concerns or negative interactions that you want us to know about? Do you have recommendations for new services or improvements to existing ones? (You will have a chance to review, amend, or add to your comments before submitting your responses.)  (At end of the survey): If you entered comments at the beginning of the survey, they are displayed below. If you would like to edit your comments, share recommendations for additional services and support resources, or add additional comments or suggestions please enter them below.  Identifying references have been removed from this document and replaced with “[IRD]”. Responses are grouped by sample: Faculty, Staff, Undergraduate students, and Graduate students.   ### Faculty responses:  On our campus (IU Kokomo) the I.T. staff is always responsive and helpful (whether I need help on campus, or working remotely)!  The UITS helpdesk always responds in a timely manner.  On an occasion I have sent an inquiry or a request to the Help Desk. The response I consistently get in return is very confusing, something about responding above the line.  I don't get it. Is this an automated response telling me that my inquiry has been received? I don't know. If so, the response could be more user friendly to the reader. Often, not knowing what to say, I just ignore it.  I was not in serviced on the Skype type of telephone. It takes me 3 or 4 times to dial a campus phone. Most of the time, I give up and use my cell phone to call or send an e-mail.  Since it is through a central system it is difficult to contact IT on my campus directly.  Students at the IUK service window are usually rude, NEVER smile, and don't greet. Seriously, they just stare at you, frowning. And with rare exception are almost completely unhelpful. Do better! You REALLY need to provide instructions for printing. It is not self-explanatory at all. Students blow their allotments on color because it's not clear how to make B&W the default. Library staff spend most of our time teaching students how to print. IT manages all digital displays and information Kiosk in our library. They are out of service or display error messages more often than not. It's sad and ridiculous.  The 24/7 support has been essential to me, as a faculty, to get my work done. The service people are very knowledgeable about Canvas.  I would like to be able to send an email to a student directly while reviewing their grades in Speed Grader, instead of having to exit Speed Grader to communicate with the student.  I get a lot out of my courses offered through the IUK CTLA center. I wish more courses were offered in the summer, because that is when new faculty like myself have more time.  I've used UITS for several wireless issues in my classroom, with mixed results. Large classes and Respondus don't work well together.  I have not had any negative experiences with UITS with the last year.  My experience at IU Kokomo has been highly positive, especially the level of service re classroom software assistance and also helping our faculty and students get their laptops up to date.  When I have had a need, it has been addressed promptly.  Every interaction I have had has been positive with the staff. However, I think the WIFI is an issue.  Typically I've had quick and helpful responses with UITS and they have been either able to solve the problem or explain a workaround. Only once or twice was that not the case.  UITS staff is always helpful. My struggle has to do with my own knowledge of the equipment.  My positive experiences are they have responded by coming to my classroom to fix some technology issues when I needed them to. Negative experiences include not being able to get a computer that can run a program I need for work because the program cannot be installed on my current computer. My recommendations are to have all the computer labs and classrooms already set up with commonly used software.  Help desk (walk-in) staff at IUK and UITS (by phone) have been very helpful!  I have always received prompt, effective assistance whenever I have requested it.  Many of my issues have been responded to quickly, which I appreciate. I find the formatting of the emails/tickets for issues a bit confusing. I do not like that I cannot use \"task manager\" on my desktop computer.   ### Staff responses:  The IT department at IUK have always been very helpful and prompt in response. Michelle and Giovanni are the two I have worked with more than anyone else in the department and they have both been very patient and quick to educate when necessary.  Our campus IT department is unfailingly helpful, knowledgeable, and patient. They're all top-notch, and we're lucky to have them.  My experiences with UITS at IU Kokomo have run hot and cold. Sometimes the service is quick and efficient; other times the person on the Helpline or at the Helpdesk hasn't been trained adequately and \"troubleshoots\" the problem by trying different solutions in a sort of random way. They are not very service-oriented. For example, after not being able to solve the problem over the phone and letting him access the laptop remotely, we were instructed to come down to the Helpdesk. We did that, and had to wait for more than 10 minutes while the chap at the Helpdesk sat on the phone with someone. We didn't get any acknowledgement, eye contact, apology, any idea of how long we would have to wait, any indication that he even knew we were there waiting. (We were in clear view.) Another person came up and stood in line behind us. Finally the Helpdesk guy hung up and turned his attention to us, but still was unable to address our log-in issue, explaining it was a problem outside of his control, but couldn't advise us where to go for help. If he knew it was outside of his control, why did he work so hard over the phone and in person to address the problem? It felt like he couldn't solve the issue, so he found an excuse to get rid of us. And I don't understand why someone else in the office couldn't intervene and help with the backup at the window, especially when we had waited for so long and other people were queuing up behind us.  Very strong department. I have no problems with them.  I appreciate the hard work of UITS.  The UITS staff is always friendly and professional.  Always ready to help!  Any time I've required the assistance of UITS, the staff member has been wonderful and gladly helped me.  The service received from IU Kokomo UITS staff is very good! They work diligently to troubleshoot and problem solve issues that are brought to their attention.  I've been pleased with how quickly my requests have been handled when I have needed help. Michael Lynch was especially helpful to me when my laptop died, directing me to the Apple Store, where it was fixed.  The work I've had done with the professionals there have been great. I hate to sound this way but, my only concern is for student workers up front taking up valuable time by trying to help with situations that they are not fully prepared to help with. And then not achieving any kind of a result. I have no recommendations for new services or improvements.  I miss the personal touch of the days the helpdesk would send a student worker to you when you were having issues. Now, their first response is usually did you re-start your computer? That question makes you feel like you are being talked down too and most of the time it is not appreciated. Most of us know the basics of computer problems.  Kelly is wonderful, she is quick to respond and very helpful. I have had experiences with other members of the team that have not been so pleasant. The reason why is they seem to talk down to people. One interaction that I had with someone in UITS was overheard by a person standing near by. Later I was approached by the person who overheard the conversation and stated that she would not have put up with being talked to in such a manner.  Another question I have why is the IQ wall in the cafeteria promoting other campuses, why couldn't the activities on our campus be promoted and not those on other campuses?  I work with the UITS employees a lot and think you have a pretty good crew here on this campus.   ### Undergraduate responses:  The staff was friendly and helpful.  The UITS staff has always been helpful and friendly whenever I reached out for assistance.  I do not have any suggestions and so far my experiences have been pleasant, informative and smooth.  Every interaction I have had with UITS has been less than pleasant. On the positive side, they have always been able to fix whatever issue it was that I had, but on the negative side, it either took days to solve, or I got passed from person to person. I personally think if the knowledge base was more user- friendly, well known, and easily accessible, I wouldn't have such a negative opinion of UITS.  The UITS staff has always been more than helpful to me! I took my computer in and the gentleman who helped me was very nice and gave me tips and advice on how best to use my computer!  The only thing that I would like to see change is the hours of operation. There are a lot of students who have to work while going to school. These students sometimes have to work during the day, as I did when I first started at IUK. I ended up having to take a half day off of work to come in and get my laptop set up. That was money that I needed for my family that I had to give up because the UITS office closed before I got off work. I think that if they could find a way to have some evening hours, it would be helpful to a lot of people.  Unknown  There is a real need to help older students get used to the internet, canvas, and general usage for the classes. IT representatives were not available before classes began because they were booked ahead of time. I couldn't get an appointment until October after classes started in August. There was no information ahead of time what you might want to load for your classes or how to set up printer services. If you have been out of school awhile it was a difficult learning curve. IT was helpful when I could get in. I heard they had 2 IT specialists to help; that seems extremely low.  I have been having a lot of problems with the Wi-Fi on campus for a week or two now, my laptop will not connect to the school's internet instantly but it does at home.  Being a CS major I have a decent amount of friends and fellow classmates that work in the UITS department. They all seem to enjoy it, and appreciate their job.  I have no issues with UITS staff. They always answer politely to questions and are ready to assist whenever. The two step login has made security more safe and secure, even though its a pain in the neck looking for my phone to connect. Overall I like it.  I met with Greg in IT prior to starting my semester at IUK and he was phenomenal!! He set up my computer, showed me how to navigate the site and gave me written instructions of what he did to my computer as well as what updates to run, when and how. He also gave recommendations for what virus software to purchase and where I could purchase it. This made things so much easier for me since it has been nearly 12 years since I was in college. Greg was very professional, courteous, patient and knowledgeable.  One recommendation I have is navigation within Canvas, there are too many places you have to go to see what is needed for one class. For example, you have the module, then the assignments and you have to go back and forth to see when things are due. This was very overwhelming for me and has definitely taken some adjusting to. Seems that it would be more convenient to have all information together rather than having to look all over (because of not being familiar with this navigation system).  Every experience that I have had has been positive! From my first week on campus helping me get my computer set up to helping me format my project posters and print them, the help that I received was nothing less than amazing! Also, whenever we had a technological issue in class, someone came to address the problem quickly which I appreciated as a student.  Quick service with Crimson Card.  All my experiences with UITS staff have been very positive. I don't believe I have any recommendations for the program.  UITS has been very helpful and has been very thorough in teaching me how to use certain applications, options for buying hardware, downloading software, and how to troubleshoot certain problems.  No  Everyone is very nice. They know how to fix almost everything and it is very appreciated.  I appreciate them walking me through the necessary steps taken to solve the issues I have had with my laptop instead of them solving it on their own.  I haven't had many experiences yet, this is my first year and I'm just learning.  I have really enjoyed getting to know my advisor and professors. I do not have any complaints from anyone.  I have never had a bad experience with the IT department. They were always able to see me in a timely fashion and have never failed to give quality assistance.  The UITS is very good at what they do. They work quick and diligently. They are also very flexible with times and will work with your schedule.  The UITS staff was very helpful with one of my projects for my International Study class and helping me put sound on PowerPoint. They did a good job of thoroughly explaining everything and scheduling a flexible schedule for me to meet up with them. I was very appreciative of their help.  I would like it if the computers upstairs had better mouse’s to work with especially for the art students. They are hard to maneuver and make it hard to edit photographs and video edits and to make 3D prints.    Everything is great.  I have been very pleased with the UITS any time something isn't working they are always there to fix it. But I find that the WI-FI isn't working quite a bit which is very inconvenient as well as there has been quite a few times when I will try to get on Canvas to do homework and the site is down for maintenance which is also very inconvenient.  The UITS staff is very helpful when you have something wrong. It does get annoying when you are on the internet and it kicks you off in the middle of doing homework. UITS staff did have a hard time getting my computer to connect.  I appreciate that even at a regional like IUK that STC computers are regularly updated and replaced as well as the computers the staff use. I've never come across a PC on campus as a student that I felt was entirely lacking or out of date.  On the negative side, there have been a few instances I've noticed of one PC in a room being entirely unusable. They usually are marked as such and I haven't had a class where there weren't enough PCs, just that sometimes those broken ones hang around awhile. I assume that's probably due to trying to fix it rather than replace it which is understandable. Additionally, most of One.IU feels very up to date but anytime we have to use SIS it's like stepping back in time 10 years. When signing up for classes I haven't had any outright issues but it's certainly the most antiquated-feeling IU website I have to use.  IU offers a lot of software to students for free and I think it would be worth making more students aware of that, especially freshmen who are often buying new computers for campus. Letting them know they get Microsoft Office for example and easy instructions on how to claim it I think would make a lot of students and parents happy.  I think the services are good. They offer great products for free for the students. They also always can fix a problem with a computer.  I went to UITS at the beginning of the semester for assistance with setting up my laptop for online classes. Very helpful! They did a great job with giving instructional assistance as well.  I have not had many interactions with UITS, but when I have it has always been a positive experience. I think the UITS staff go above and beyond to help with any technical issues. My only complaint is a that a couple times I was unable to walk-in and see them due to their office being closed or being understaffed due to the high need of IT help.  Chris Butte is awesome!  I believe we have a wonderful UITS staff that are always doing their best.  All of the staff I have worked with at UITS have been incredibly helpful and very nice. I think having the office open later with more staff would be beneficial.  All positive interactions with our IT staff. Great guys.  No problems/issues. Nice campus. All staff was helpful and friendly. Positive experience! Definitely recommended college.  Due to my work schedule I can currently only take evening classes. One of my required classes was cancelled this semester. Also there is never an option for an evening advising appointment.  Quicker response times to ticket claims would be fantastic.  I do not have a lot of experience with the UITS department. They are helpful when I take my computer to them and ask for help. The campus Wi-Fi is frustrating sometimes because it will often shut off and not work.  UITS has always been professional and friendly in my interactions with them. They are always helpful and I have never had any complaints.  I have enjoyed using the IT support that is available daily on campus.  Staff has always been able to help me with any issues that I have had. The only issue I have is not being able to connect to Secure right away as it connects to Guest first.  There needs to be 100 times the amount of closed off, quiet, personal space with an IUK computer! People do NOT act like adults! In study open study areas, on many occasions, people are loud, rude, obnoxious, disruptive and disrespectful!!! I've even seen people making out in these areas. I try to do my [IRD] on campus where it SHOULD be a good environment for this, but half the time it is not so. This problem exists even with earplugs in. The library's 2nd floor needs dozens more computers to get away from the noise. This happens in the library nearly every time I go. It should not be a place to hang out. Some of them are Annex students, I know because they were so loud and distracting. I pay just as much as these students do and deserve and have a right to use the computers peacefully and productively.  I have had a very positive experience with getting my accounts and my laptop set up. I also have had a positive experience with getting help with a project using multiple programs.  I am very grateful for the excellent level of support and assistance that is available at IUK. It has enabled me to integrate back into finishing my degree without any technical difficulty. I would have been lost in many ways without it!  The Mac lab is great. The Wi-Fi throughout campus is really bad, I have struggled with it basically every day that I'm there.  UITS is eager to help via scheduled appointments but not they do not fix issues in classrooms without work orders and they don't fix issues promptly such as; nursing simulation labs. The wireless network does not work well at all. I have had to use the guest.   ### Graduate responses:  56480949        My experience with UITS staff and services has been satisfactory. I have found the staff to be very helpful and positive.  My one concern is the switchboard service at IUK. The message has been coming through with static, which makes it rather hard to hear, although it is a recording.  Another seemingly needless issue is the same recording that one must listen to, while awaiting a staff person to answer. I'm not sure of its purpose, but it takes up time before someone answers to direct my call.  Another concern is that when a student /staff person answers, I have heard them laughing into the phone before saying \"This is Indiana University - Kokomo, may I help you?\" I feel this is not good phone etiquette.  Thank you "

    "body": "  ## 2021 UITS User Survey IUPUI  – Open Text Responses (Edited)  This text file includes responses to the following question of the UITS survey:  (At start of the survey): As you get started, please take a moment to share with us any thoughts, concerns, issues, and/or ideas that you may have. What positive experiences with UITS staff or services have you had? Are there concerns or negative interactions that you want us to know about? Do you have recommendations for new services or improvements to existing ones? (You will have a chance to review, amend, or add to your comments before submitting your responses.)  (At end of the survey): If you entered comments at the beginning of the survey, they are displayed below. If you would like to edit your comments, share recommendations for additional services and support resources, or add additional comments or suggestions please enter them below.  The responses are listed by respondent case number. Case numbers, in which the respondent did not leave any text, are not included.  Identifying references have been removed from this document and replaced with “[IRD]”. Responses are grouped by sample: Faculty, Staff, Undergraduate students, and Graduate students.   ### Faculty responses:  Overall, I have had very positive experiences with UITS staff. I think the one negative is response time and/or follow through with requests.  The UITS staff that help me with issues are typically very friendly and provide me with viable solutions. However, the recent Exchange migration was executed very poorly. It was not announced to the users. It has caused countless hours of my spending time on the phone with the help desk attempting to get my calendar and email on my iPhone. None of the offered solutions worked. There is no concrete answer when this problem will be resolved. It has been and continues to be a disaster.  None at this time.  They are generally quite fast to answer, not necessarily will solve the issue, depending on its complexity and even during the pandemic very responsive and helpful to have all of us to function working from home.  UITS staff is very well trained and always came with a solution for any matter that I have contacted them about.  Great help during the switch to remote working and teaching. I anticipate need for guidance on best tips to consider as we decide how to \"return\" to campus work/teaching.  na  I want to thank the folks who work the helpline 24hrs, seven days a week. They have been so helpful with quickly fixing problems during this complicated time of working remotely and from home.  4 hours is too long to get help for IT issues.  Email response to request for help is difficult to read.  I have always gotten a very good experience with UITS staff. My only concern is our WIFI connection which is almost undetectable in our lab in the third floor of the [IRD] building. If you can do something about it that would be appreciated.  UITS staff is wonderful and very helpful! I am a bit concerned about Big Red 200 and when it will go online. It was launched almost a year ago, but we still don't have access. Is something wrong or was the \"launch\" more of a groundbreaking?  Overall I am satisfied with the service quality of the UITS.  The IU systems were largely successful through the covid, which brought about unprecedented challenges. There were some blips along the way, but these were resolved in a reasonable length of time.  My frustrations are threefold. I would noted that I am less than certain about the division between UITS, Educational technology, and the information technology at IUSM, which is my home school,  The first concern is for me to do my job I need to purchase out of pocket a number of devices and monthly services. The cell phone is one example, but there are others, including personal computers. These are essential for my work, and there are a number of apps that are on my phone that are expected for faculty. I use my cell phone about 75% for work and this is a cost that I cover out of pocket.  The second concern is largely tied to the applications of the on-line systems at IUPUI and expectations about faculty use of their valuable time. Educational technology were always pleasant to talk to about potential problems, but were arguably inflexible about the course goals and arrangements. For example, the amount of Canvas memory for a class was nonnegotiable as were organizational arrangements with Kaltura, which I thought was problematic for many reasons. There were lots of help to explain to faculty how they could use lots of their valuable time to adhere to preferences from the technology people and not enough about how best to achieve faculty goals and utilization of faculty time. Faculty time is an important resources, and unfortunately IUPUI and IUSM view this as a limitless asset to use to save costs.  The third concern is the information technology at IUSM, which is centralized at IUSM. This system is painful for the faculty. At one time, departments had a IT person to seek help from and there was a personal connection. Overall, a good value for the department. I think that this was largely lost with the restructuring and creation of the executive associate dean position. This is a perspective that is largely shared among faculty colleagues. This dissatisfaction extends to the maintenance and problem solving with hardware and software, department and lab web sites, as well as the centralized systems. Overall, I think that this structure and centralization provides poor service for faculty.  The move away from Box has been a total pain, and I hope the cost savings was substantial because the time cost and extra steps are very frustrating.  The change with Exchange over the past two days is still messing up my phone. I can't get my emails.  I don't think you seek enough faculty input before changes are made. All the Canvas changes that were made started for the summer without any warning or training available. I never saw anything to help until August for the fall, and I needed to know it in April before summer started. I would be willing to help with a focus group but I will be leaving IU.  Sometimes I feel when I call the UITS call center, I know more about the technology; I wish there was a specific option for people that use technologies to get help. Many of my issues need to get through a second-tier and email my issues, which can sometimes be difficult.  I think that UITS has done a great job of helping faculty transition to online teaching. Kudos to all that has been done throughout this academic year, and last spring and summer; it has been very difficult but you all have made it a lot more bearable.  I've had zero issues with UITS staff. They always find a solution one way or the other.  I've had excellent service.  I always had good/positive experiences with the staff over at UITS, whether on phone or on Chat (they are very responsive).  As a physician dually employed by IU and IUH, I have many issues that come from firewalls and limitations of access when I am working in an IUH hospital. Generally speaking, I cannot always log on to IU versions of software when I am on the IUH network, or have trouble getting IU email on my phone, which is registered via IUH.  For the most part, working with UITS has always been a positive experience. However, my main concern is that all the security constraints that are put in place make it somewhat difficult to install and use specific software tools and, hence, hinder research. I wish a middle ground could be found where users are given more direct control over their computers, operating systems, and software to permit a more efficient process and enhance research activities.  Would like to see certain users granted admin privileges on their own work stations (even if it means going through some kind of training, etc.). I'm sure UITS has better things to do than grant overrides for the esoteric one-off software I use in my daily work.  Please bring Box back-- the Microsoft Teams interface is painful and obstructive.  positive interactions- I have had questions about Zoom - all handled efficiently! Thank you!!  The roll-out for ceasing support of the Box was abysmal. I still have problems accessing data lost in that move. PATHETIC.  Generally helpful. Takes a while to get help sometimes .  People on the help line are generally very good. Field service people who come to the offices are not that knowledgeable about what they are doing.  School of E&T has a dedicated Computer Network Center team that deals effectively and responsively with school-specific concerns. This model works very well. I have found my few interactions with the broader UITS organization (most commonly about classroom technologies in general inventory classrooms) to be much slower.  Although I know upgrades to classroom technologies last summer were made under a tight timeline to enable hybrid teaching, I was disappointed it did not include cameras that would show the whiteboard in the classroom, which I use extensively under normal circumstances.  Any time I have had a personal problem with tech, Helpnet and the folks at the IU Help line ([IRD]in particular) have been very helpful!  I have so many incoming emails daily that I don't do a great job of following all of the ones that look like bureaucratic tedium. For example, I must have ignored the recent Outlook migration, which caused a minor heart palpitation.  It would be great if you could differentiate emails that require my action from those that are FYI in the subject lines.  Please keep the free 24/7 call-in UITS phone line and please keep it staffed by live individuals trained in computer technology and software used by IU. I have found it especially helpful to talk with individuals who have a lot of experience working with a broad range of tech issues.(i.e. they have their own business perhaps as well or used to; have institutional memory or \"technology memory\"). Please keep the phone options. It is really beneficial to be able to select 2 and talk to someone who is well- trained and has experience using Canvas. My ability to help students and fulfil my other duties would be noticeably and negatively impacted if the service was automated or I had to rely solely on the KB. It is also helpful that the support staff can go in and see my account and even view what is going on in Canvas when we can't figure out the problem verbally.  I.T. strikes me as one of those services that people just assume will work well, so perhaps you are not hearing all the good things you should. The fact is, I think my experience with UITS is probably 90% positive. When a unit works like it should, people don't even think about. The 10% negative can really hurt though if it occurs at key moments. For instance, this transition of email to a different platform has been disastrous for me. I'm one of those caught in limbo who has lost email, calendar, etc. Why must UITS make this change in the middle of a semester?  When I have a specific person I can contact, I have gotten very good response and help.  The emails sent describing digital concepts are often written in vocabulary that is IT centered, and not understood by those of us who do not understand IT -- like what does HTML mean and what does it have to do with me?  The classes advertised by IT to learn the software are a great idea. But my job has be teaching or on a clinic floor most of every day so I cannot ever take off to attend all the classes it might take to let me learn the programs.  Group is knowledgeable and responsive to needs.  Dealing with IT via email is a frustrating process. Whoever helps on the other end regularly reads only part of my email and then asks questions already answered in the email they failed to read. In addition, the system for some reason doesn't allow successive emails in a chain so that I only see the most recent email in a chain. While I believe IT has access to the entire chain, I am also led to believe people on the other end fairly often only look at the most recent email in the chain as that's the one I was forced to respond to.  In addition, it should not be allowed for IT to close a ticket without permission from the original ticket submitter. This is a very bad policy and very often ends up with closed tickets when issues are clearly not \"resolved\". I'm not sure why but IT seems to be afraid of picking up the phone and just getting the issue cleared up...much easier than sending a barrage of misread emails back and forth. IT needs to seriously reconsider its trend towards emails instead of just using the phone.  In general, IT takes a long time to help. On occasion they take weeks to respond to certain issues. This might be ok for certain issues, but they never contact me throughout those weeks making me think they have resolved not to deal with the issue. If I try to help, they get mad and never apologize for taking those weeks to respond. In general, I have not had good experiences with IT.  The IT folks have been outstanding this year!!!!!! Honestly, they are great - [IRD] has helped me so much. My only struggle is with the email responses. Sometimes it is tough to see where [IRD] has commented and if the email needs a response or not.  My interaction with UITS staff has always been positive. The only \"bad\" experience I had was during our Covid transition to online, I submitted a question/issue that took several weeks to resolve. The time was based on response time versus a technical issue. However, I understand we were in a difficult time, and I am sure UITS was swamped with requests. Overall, I think UITS staff are very efficient and I appreciate the services available.  Nothing at this time.  The UITS staff's services have been very helpful when needed.  No concerns. Issue was quickly addressed.  I don't interact with UITS staff all that often, but there have been a few times when I've had to call about technology issues in my classroom, and the response has been swift and helpful.  I have needed classroom support once in Spring 2020, and the tech support person was patient, thoughtful, and knowledgeable.  Mostly positive interactions. My first instinct is always to check out Knowledge Base before requiring direct assistance.  The UITS staff person was very knowledgeable and was able to address my issue right away. There was a long wait time however to get a person on the phone  On [IRD] I was running an online event from the IUPUI campus and we had technology issues (specifically, one of the conference rooms in [IRD] did not have working audio). We tried 3 other conference rooms ([IRD], [IRD], and [IRD]), and none of their technology worked either. I called HTS and was initially routed to UITS. The technician was not not able to resolve my issues over the phone, so they dispatched someone to my location. Although I am extremely grateful that someone drove to campus to help us, it did take more than 3 hours from my initial call until I was able to receive help. I do not fault the technician, but I would appreciate more on-site support, especially as more employees and students are returning to campus. Also, the rooms listed above (except [IRD]) are still not operational.  The way the migration of files out of Box,--and particularly the slow, incomplete, and at times inaccurate information (in the kb and other places) about the alternate storage options was handled-- is by far the greatest frustration I have had with any of your services in my 14 + years at IU. The information about OneDrive changed, and there was no real guidance about Microsoft Secure Storage vs. Google Secure storage. In the end I now operate in OneDrive with a group out of Bloomington (yes I know it's not supposed to be used for that, but I'm not in a position to change their mind). The CTL and Canvas people use Google Drive. And my School unit is looking like they will adopt MS Teams.  It's incredibly frustrating to have no leadership on the direction of where to go, and now to have to interface with all of these various entities who have chosen to go different directions. Oh, and medicine and dentistry are building out full blown Sharepoint sites, which is yet another different way of handling storage of files. Again, the lack of guidance has resulted in various units on ALL of the platforms, and I find my self wondering where in the world the files are that I need with any given group.  The IT guys at IUSD are great! They are all very friendly and knowledgeable and get issues rectified quickly! They listen and get to the heart of the problem without being judgemental!  During my time at IUPUI, my interaction with UITS has been overwhelmingly positive.  The main concern, in the School of Liberal Arts, is that, with our in-house tech staff soon retiring, UITS service, based on a horrid ticketing system, will become completely depersonalized, with personnel hard to communicate with meaningfully, and hard to relate to because that personnel is little likely to be sympathetic to humanities faculty needs. Humanities research centers (as opposed to department and programs) will be in great trouble because UITS treats them as though they were not headed by departmental faculty (and yet they are), and charge them exorbitant costs they are not budgeted to afford. UITS, it is hoped, will understand never to charge humanities research centers for UITS personnel compensation (since that personnel is on UITS payroll and not on research center payroll). UITS should always remember that humanities grants are generally very small. The distinction between the type and conditions of service to departments/programs vs. to research centers need to be abolished on grounds of arbitrary discrimination and illogicality.  One of my courses was Zoom bombed in early April, 2020, and the UITS team (especially at the School of Public Health, IUB) was fantastic in helping me cope with and resolve the problem.  Not sure if this is the right place to provide the following feedback:  -           IU Zoom was just updated on my computer yesterday, and the Box that indicated that students are in the waiting room has changed. :( Now it's smaller, black (blends in with the background), and no longer flashes. It used to be orange, large, and flashed. Yesterday I didn't see that two students were waiting, and I never admitted them, so they missed class. Also, I'm used to locating the admit button on the bottom Zoom toolbar--now the toolbar and button are at the top of the screen--and I didn't see it because I was used to looking at the bottom. It's hard to notice everything at once when I'm already teaching and showing PPT slides, plus I have two monitors, so there are at least four possible places to which the toolbar seems to randomly move: screen 1 top, screen 1 bottom, screen 2 top, screen 2 bottom. Why the change in the admit notice/button? It just adds to the frustration.  -           Outlook email is imperfect. If I scroll down in my email in-Box to previous weeks, the entire list goes haywire, jerking around, back and forth, and won't let me click on any email.  -           I haven't yet integrated Modules on Canvas; I've tried and given up. In particular, when I tried to link Discussions to a specific module week, the link would not work, and students couldn't access the required discussion. I was probably doing something wrong, but I couldn't figure it out. Now, I just create a Page for each week (in Pages) and upload the weekly page onto the Home Page; I think this procedure basically duplicates the intention of the Modules feature.  I constantly have great experiences. I am so impressed!  Appreciate the support received from UITS during the pandemic- resources available were great and support.  The old machines, controlled by WinXP and below should be allowed for continued use.  There are some folks I talk with at UITS who are AMAZING. When I get them when I call in, I am so relieved. I know that they will help me with what I am looking for help with, and they do. But then sometimes I get someone who really doesn't know anything and can't help me at all. I often have to hang up and try calling again to get someone who is more knowledgeable.  I haven't had many interactions with UITS staff. I'd like to see more campus swag stations with info on new projects  When calling the Help Desk with Canvas issues or Box (prior to 2021) or other software, the person answering the call responds as if they are knowledgeable and is reluctant to advance the issue with someone more knowledgeable but is lacking in expertise to solve the problem. Thoughts: I love that you have this service available 24/7 to all students, faculty, and staff. Concerns or negative interactions: Students have a lot of technical issues that interfere with their learning and require me as an instructor to address, since they are not willing to contact UITS. They generally contact me in anxiety and expect me to solve all their technical issues and do not seem to believe me when I direct them to UITS. It needs to be very transparent to students that they NEED to use the UITS service for all their technology problems and NOT rely on the instructor or fellow classmates for this. This is highly problematic in online courses. Issues:Students should also be required to post a profile picture that appears with their name in discussion posts so we know who they are and can see their face, unless there is a privacy concern. In a face to face class, we see students' faces, so in the online class this seems like a reasonable request, especially to connect better through discussions. Ideas: Having a UITS or technical expert do videos on how to use the basic technical tools in Canvas is desperately needed. Students and faculty do not have time to read long narratives of how-to steps; a video with simple visuals and instructions is all we need and will be much appreciated. Recommendations for new services: Increasing the UITS consultants will help students out a lot, especially the purely online students. They struggle with technical know-how and get very upset about it. I think they need more UITS support. Recommendation to improve existing services:Canvas tools can be improved so it is easy for instructors to grade. inbox emails are difficult now since we have to select 'favorite courses' and then choose the class and then select the student from the list (which takes a long time), and this process is just too long; it needs to be much simpler. Also, quite a few times some of the UITS consultants did not seem to know how to solve my technical problems and seemed to be just guessing. This could be improved by offering more professional development for the consultants. I had to ask family members who knew about computers for help to fix issues. It would also help for IT consultants to not speak very softly since very often I could not hear them. Some of us have hearing problems and need the consultants to be a little louder and more clearly articulate their words so communication is better. Lastly, after completing this survey I saw so many things I had never heard of before. The availability of these important services is great, but if we do not know about this, it is an issue. i feel that this information needs to be communicated to faculty, staff, and students in a more organized and regular fashion. Maybe sending out a BRIEF email every month with reminders about services and what they are or new services and links to videos will be helpful. I like the pop-ups that appear above the courses on the dashboard, but I often do not read them since they are quite wordy and I do not have the time, but a brief email can be a better communication tool. It can also help educate us technically which is a plus!  Our department used to have our own dedicated IT person; however, the administration felt it was better to remove that IT person and reassign them to the general IUSM IT personal. Because of that, I felt that IT service has declined in our department. I believe this decision was based primarily on cost effectiveness, but while it may cost the administration less, it actually just shifted those savings further on to the department, so worse IT service now costs us even more. That said, since I have started nearly a decade ago, I have had the feeling that overall IT service has declined, to the point where I really do not like having to contact IT about anything. When I do, problems are often unresolved, and so I just leave it be. The data storage policies are haphazard and constantly changing, which makes lab consistency difficult. The best option I had was simply having local network drive access and maintenance; however, I believe the administration felt this was not cost effective, so went with IU Box, MS OneDrive, and Google Drive, none of which I feel give the reliability and ease of access as the locally administered network drives. Nor do I think they are as secure, which is very serious considering the need for HIPAA compliance. I am also not looking forward to the continued \"tightening of IT grip\" on computers, and the possibility of limiting my access and oversight of my own computer. As a PI, I believe I should have full administrative rights over my own computer. If that is taken away, and considering the terrible data storage options now, I am seriously contemplating trying to withdraw from any kind of IT involvement in my lab operations.  Anytime I used the UITS services they were very efficient. Not sure if with you, but at the School of Dentistry the infrastructure is really outdated, network old, internet speed very slow. Team there is great for IT/UITS/CAITS. Canvas is not easy to use. Kaltura has better competition software available  Box is much better than OneDrive. Overall wired internet and network speed / conditions at the School of Dentistry very low.  Have been here 4 years and still find something new every day at the Campus that I could be using; maybe improved and more frequent communication can help.  I have had very positive one-on-one experiences with UITS staff in the past. My major concerns are with Canvas and especially the phone system. 1) Canvas is not user friendly and 2) I have never received a decent voicemail message - the phone system is all screwed up. I do not like the phone system tied into my computer.  I didn't use the UITS very often, but every time I used them, they fixed my problem or gave me instructions how to fix very quickly and efficiently.  ASL Interpreting program has some issues with technology. Minor assistance was no problem, but this program truly needs a dedicated technology person to work with us. We have a test pilot e-course (free), and we have had a difficult time trying to explain our needs to install a dictionary in our Canvas. Every time I and or another coworker called, we get different people, and they do not know what we were talking about. We had to re-explain our situation. It has been an ongoing issue. Frustration.  In the past we have developed and edited videos on our own- we are not trained in the area, but we had to. We wish we could have someone in the technology dept that will assist with creating, installing assignments, etc.  The UITS staff, especially those related to HPC, are not qualified for their job. I had a simple question regarding running the models using the supercomputer facilities. However, no direct answers were given after multiple communications. This should be UITS staff's responsibility to instruct users how to run the models, not my job to figure out the computational system since I don't have the administrator's permission.  Remote work and remote teaching with technology have been challenging; it always seems like there's never enough time to keep up with all the changes.   I'm not a digital native, but I'm noticing that even my younger colleagues are getting caught by surprise or flummoxed by some of the changes, i.e. Box migration (I realize UITS had no other choice), MS Teams and how things are interwoven with Sharepoint, and Office 365. I think having an onsite/departmental LSP would be beneficial - but understand that's not always feasible.  To be honest, compared to my colleagues at other Universities, IU has an abundance of technology available - so much tech, and it seems not enough time to get to use it fully! Please keep up the good work.  For important information or any changes that may alter or impact our ability to use any of the services, could you email all people instead of relying on others to forward the email? Thank you.  Most recently I had a service call with UITS that was awesome! The technician kept asking if there was anything else he could do, so I went through several issues, and he resolved them all. My requests for service were stuck in my department's IT, and they were not getting resolved there.  Not happy with the phone system and hard to get help for it. Skype is often difficult to use and have never gotten the business one to work.  Not sure how much you control parking services, but I was unhappy how my permit was handled this past year (I complained to them but they did nothing).  Our group joined hts this year, and we have a great new IT person who has been helpful in solving issues.  Quick response is what I like the most.  -           Excellent experience so far with support staff.  -           One Drive can be more user friendly and intuitive. Currently it is difficult to find correct folders, as the organization when transferred from IU Box is a bit confusing.  The UITS staff at the IUSON are great. You needed a selection of \"satisfied.\" There were many things in the survey that I was more than \"somewhat satisfied\" but less than \"extremely satisfied.\"  I have had positive experiences with UITS staff and am generally able to find answers to my questions on the website or other help pages. My lower scores are for in-classroom technology - Cavanaugh Hall needs massive updates.  As a School of Liberal Arts faculty member, my main concern is losing the extraordinary support we have received from in-house technology leaders, [IRD] and [IRD]. I hope the transition to Tech Select is smooth and they provide the same responsiveness and creativity. In addition, it was a big blow to lose the IUBox system. I understand that we were priced out of losing it. I hope the new arrangements with Microsoft Teams and Google Drive prove to be more permanent. Permanence really helps with collaboration.  I really appreciate the around-the-clock support UITS provides and have always had positive experiences interacting with the people responding to help-desk calls. Even when the issue I called about couldn't be resolved, I was satisfied with the attempts made to help me and the recommendations for next steps provided.  Does IU subscribe to digital photo repositories, like Shutterstock, so faculty can download and use photos in their Canvas courses?  I think the UITS telephone help service is the most outstanding help service of any kind that I have ever used or encountered. Not only have they almost always had a ready solution to my questions without fail but have sometimes identified prospective issues to avoid and suggested more efficient ways of accomplishing tasks. On rare occasions where they didn't have an answer, they escalated the issue quickly and I was contacted promptly with a solution.  Canvas - good but functionality could be greatly improved re inbox and Quizzes  Kaltura - great improvement in past year but functionality could be improved re returning to My Media after accessing files and especially organizing files.  Zoom - excellent; just what I need, and I use it all the time.  Creative Cloud - Also use it all the time but very frustrating in giving me frequent messages that my account has expired (when it hasn't), requiring logging out and then logging back in  Thanks for asking.  I have to say that UITS as an organization appears to strive for the best services for its customers. Having said this, I do have to say that I have been very disappointed with the number of changes in supported software and how they have been rolled out. As a researcher working on large multi- institutional projects, I find it decidedly inconvenient that UITS shifted its cloud based storage model from Box to GoogleDrive and/or OneDrive. After having spent more than 3 years working on Box contributions, our team was forced to switch to these sub-par solutions, and as such our team's productivity has suffered. My major complaint is that UITS did not ask if users wanted to change, but instead were told that this would occur. This \"like it or lump it\" attitude does not align with the organization's model of customer support. I would hope in the future that the leadership of UITS would reach out to the broader community to seek feedback before making drastic changes that impact the entire campus and the employees who have to use this new technology.  We have in-house tech support, so my support has come mainly locally. But support for things like Canvas has been good.  My biggest concern is too much flux and transition between software and storage providers and routines. For instance, the transition from Box to OneDrive and Teams has been very disruptive. It's created a number of problems with collaborators within and outside IU, and for members of my department (I'm a chair). It seems like an organization the size of IU should be able to provide these services internally and create more stability. Or have more leverage to access better and more durable platforms.  Staff answering calls is knowledgeable, very helpful, and professional. Every interaction with UITS so far have been very positive.  Not presently.  I am still relatively new to campus so my interaction with UITS staff has been somewhat limited. However, I will relay one experience that was disheartening. Upon my arrival to campus, I was dismayed that there was literally NO FORMALIZED ON-BOARDING PROCEDURE or TYPE OF CLASSROOM ORIENTATION PROCEDURE with the basic tools, equipment, capacities etc. available in a \"generic classroom\". Everything I had to learn was \"off the cuff\", the result of asking colleagues or trial and error on my part. :(  I am not sure where the disconnect is ---whether this is a UITS fail, a system-wide gap, an \"individual school\" fail, or even a \"departmental leadership\" fail. Or perhaps it is a systemic issue that is compounded by any number of these factors, combined.  Regardless, I found that to be unacceptable. I literally had no idea what to do with ANY OF THE EQUIPMENT for the better part of three weeks. I wasn't directed anywhere. I was got given contextual materials. No orientations. NOTHING.  Granted, I would have not expected any type of \"mastery\" regarding anything with a quick acclimation to the classroom standard equipment (control panels, projectors, screens, computers, remotes etc.) But still  and since we have been forced to work remotely due to the pandemic (with only having had about 5 months ON SITE BEFORE THE BIG SHIFT) I would imagine that upon returning to campus next academic year  I will be in need of \"memory jogging\" for sure.  I know many on campus are confused by the transition from Box to SharePoint, Google Drive, etc. I also tried to understand from going to kb.indiana.edu, and it was not helpful. I think UITS should have some sort of advisory board that knows nothing about technology, and this board should help with disseminating new initiatives to the masses.  The help desk is exceptionally good - the best IT help desk on the planet!  When you refer to mitigation testing, I first think of COVID-19. I don't think that is what you are referring to.  UITS has always been very responsive to any questions or concerns. Would like additional information on reporting (and avoiding) phishing and other types of internet attacks. Would like readily available help guides for using Adobe Creative Cloud and other cloud-based applications.  None at this time, I appreciate the work and resources that you all provide.  Sometimes there have been delays in response to IT Help requests, but that has been better over the last quarter.  Every time I have called, the staff has always been very knowledgeable.  The transition away from Box has been challenging.  In general I am so satisfied about UITS service.  Help desk personnel were nice.  I do not like how you change software, servers, etc. during the semester.  For the most part, my experiences have been good and staff has been quick to respond to my issues. My biggest issue was when I upgraded to my current computer. The staff member ordered the standard laptop instead of matching the specs from my old laptop since I utilized special imaging software that required higher specs. Then the IU OS image had issues and required reinstallation; however, COVID stay at home orders arrived and delayed all IT services that required touching the laptop, and I had to wait around three months before the staff member could reinstall the OS image. This was far from ideal especially since I was working from home two to three days a week.  My experiences with UITS staff have been good so far. I've been part of the IU community since 2010 and have no complaints the IT staff-help desk are VERY helpful!! for the last several years they have helped me solving all problems I faced. They are worth every penny the University pays them.  UITS assistance is very timely and helpful.  365 migration is a disaster, sorry.  No  I work at an IUH clinic, which means that there are specific challenges that aren't \"owned\" by UITS or \"owned\" by IU Health. We have had many delays in the process of getting technology worked on/upgraded because neither group takes ownership. This has negatively impacted medical education.  It seems like real time assistance is sometimes hard to get. It would be great if IU and IUHP technology worked better together. For example, I've had lots of trouble using my IUSOM laptop on the IUH network.  None  My most positive experience is with 274-HELP! They are wonderful. I think UITS does an excellent job with security and providing IT help. It is their core function, and I appreciate these services.  I understand the need for MS Outlook for delegation and scheduling; however, I would very much appreciate the interoperability of Gmail with Google Workspace. This would be especially useful for communication with students, scheduling 1:1 sessions, scheduling Zoom sessions, and file sharing. I appreciate the Bomgar sessions to keep my Mac software up to date and install new programs.  However, I tried to join the IU Desktop pilot without successful installation. [IRD]is a great resource, intelligent, practical, and very approachable. He brings all that and more to the IFC Technology Committee. The IUSM/IUH CME cloudCME software program is terrible, does not permit hierarchical/tiered access levels, and requires time-consuming manual data entry - please find a replacement. Also, consider how Google Meet and MS Teams recordings can be readily available via Kaltura or similar.  In general I have had very positive experiences with the UITS staff and once I get ahold of them have my issues improved efficiently. However, I sometimes have a hard time finding the page or number to place my request for contact, and there is no way to Google and find them.  The basement of University Hospital sometimes has very unstable wifi. My mac computer and iphone consistently loses connection, and diagnotes and text messages are often delayed. This represents a safety risk since IU requires us to use the diagnotes app for paging purposes.  My school has its own technical staff, which is very helpful and responsive.  The wired and wireless internet are terrific. I have had positive experiences overall when calling UITS for an issue with Canvas. I did not have success when calling for help to use Teams for a committee meeting outside of IU.  My overall experience with UITS is satisfactory. However, they are slow in responding to some of the deliverables.  Most of the time the UITS is helpful and tries to answer and/or address issues promptly.  IT has always been very helpful and responsive in fixing computer issues in my office.  Positives: Staff tend to be friendly and try to be helpful. Negatives: Unevenness in the ability of staff to solve problems.  I know that you are overwhelmed with calls lately, but it might be nice to bolster the people power until things settle down again. The wait times are longer than usual.  UITS does not have a great track record (with me) of following up and following through on resolving IT problems.  The UITS service is prompt without much wait time usually. The staff is knowledgeable and almost always has a solution.  My experiences have been positive with staff. I've gotten prompt responses when there was an issue with my computer or software. I have had issues understanding how to get license numbers/passcodes to download and install software on my personal computer.     ### Staff responses:  [IRD] is always super helpful and knowledgeable. He is usually my (and my team's) go to when anything IT related is going on. Thanks [IRD]!  All tickets/questions have been quickly followed-up on and resolved.  We do not many of the services, and it would be helpful to get more information.  I had a great experience with [IRD] when I couldn't get Campaigns to work in Adrx. She proactively reached out when they saw the errors I was generating. Other than that, it's been sometimes frustrating with the change from Box because my student employees are struggling to learn Office 365.  I appreciate the quality service I receive from UITS. Problems are addressed quickly and almost always resolved to my satisfaction. I had have issues with Kaltura in the past (lengthy processing times, for example), but that is beyond the scope of what UITS can assist with.  Our CTO IT folks are very helpful, and I have only positive things to say about [IRD] and [IRD].  I am concerned about how IU school of medicine and IU health will be integrating Microsoft teams. So far it seems like as a SOM person, I won't be able to join the IUhealth Microsoft teams groups. This is difficult for my specific job role since I need to [IRD] and IUH Microsoft teams is used (which I'm excluded from seeing).  In 2020, I didn't have any issues to be addressed, so I don't have any recent comments.  -The move to OneDrive from Box this year has been stressful for some in my group with loss of data.  -           I loved the access to LinkedIn Learning!!  -Crimson card services annoyed me with a fee or charge no matter what choice I selected to do with the money left in my account.  -           Functioning of Zoom Conferencing went smoothly when working from home.  There have been many frustrations since we have switched to all IT being under UITS control; however the most severe ones I can think of are:  1)         Being put into a queue instead of being able to be dealt with immediately.  2)         Probably the most concerning is restarting my computer without giving me a chance to get to a save point. At any given time, I may have as many as 10 spreadsheets with manipulations that I don't want permanent. I used to be able to compare the \"last saved\" version to the \"auto-saved\" version and see what needs changed. It was still time consuming, but since the most recent update, I haven't been able to see the \"auto-saved\" version of any file. Not only is this frustrating for me, but I have had to reach out to faculty members embarrassingly to confirm what information is valid.  I have recently had two positive experiences with Tech Select, which services my department. One time, quite a while ago, I contacted them and never heard back. As far as software offered and logging into the VPN, I've had few issues since working from home in the last year.  I've had to contact and talk with UITS staff and services multiple times over the last year and every experience I had was extremely positive and efficient! I got the impression that everyone was very invested in making sure that any problems I was going through were resolved quickly. I particularly like the service where I can provide my phone number and continue working until I receive a call back; that way I don't have to spend very much time on hold.  I don't have any thoughts or recommendations on how to improve.  individual staff I talk to are always helpful and can solve issues right away. It is a little unwieldy at times to figure out which office (UITS, OCSS, etc.) or which help ticket form I need to use depending on the issue, but overall things work pretty efficiently.  I am very happy with UITS services  I have pretty good experience with UITS desktop help staff. They are very helpful and normally get the issues resolved in a couple of email conversations.  When I started, I had a wonderful experience getting my new employee IUSM laptop. We have had several issues with using Eduroam in our office with no improvement. There are also many barriers to integrating between IUSM and IUH.  I have nothing to add.  Working with Tier 2 services is great; [IRD], [IRD] and [IRD] have their teams running well and working with those is always great. I would say Leveraged Services Printing and SSSP/DHRs would be my biggest complaints; LS because trying to order a new Ricoh printer is a protracted and painful experience, and the SSSP/DHR because it seems like things disappear when they get to the data stewards, and it can be weeks before we hear anything back.  I wish IUAnyWhere desktop would have Adobe Cloud capabilities. I can utilize STC virtual desktop but it does not preserve any settings. It works wonderfully for Adobe suite and other programs. The Outlook email signatures and templates do not carry through, and thus creates an inconvenience when sending emails. IUAnywhere desktop preserves the settings in Outlook but it does not have Adobe suite flexibility. The sound is an issue too.  On an individual basis, I have enjoyed working with UITS staff. As a whole I have been very disappointed with how the migration from Box was handled. I understand that we needed to get out of Box before being charged more but the process felt too rushed, and I felt we were flying blind.  Information seems very scattered, especially all the different training that is offered.  Responses to tickets are always prompt and helpful. I know if I have any IT issues that whoever I speak to will be helpful as well as kind and patient.  Generally, I have had positive experiences.  All in all, I believe UITS does a great job. What might be nice is a portal where regular users like me can log in and see a history of their previous tech issues and any notes from previous reps on what worked or didn't. Because we have different reps every time we call with an issue, it could help troubleshoot in the future. It might also eliminate the need to call the helpdesk unnecessarily. I also think it would be cool to have a video chat option when someone is helping me remotely. It's just nice to put a face with the voice over the phone.  I deal mostly with PEDS IT most of the reps are easy to work with and always professional. Some are funnier than others, I like that, you can and I want to joke around, it breaks the ice and if what you've been dealing with has been very frustrating it helps with that!  The EWA group with UITS is awesome to work with; they always go above and beyond what is asked for to make sure our servers are working correctly and secure. The only problem I have had with UITS is knowing what department to submit a ticket to when I have an IT issue. I am not an IT professional, and when something doesn't work I don't always know which group to submit a ticket to, and if I submit something to the wrong group it doesn't always get directed to the correct group. With all that said, I think UITS is great to work with.  Extremely frustrated with all of the \"updates\" which have disrupted my service. Additionally, new programs introduced with bugs and incomplete applications/data have added to an already frustrating work experience.  Overload! Historically IU Launches IT \"systems\" and/or software before training. Non-intuitive and I'm unable to figure out on my own. From campus, should not take 3-5 minutes to send email. Current complaint January 26, 2021) Outlook = \"Not Responding\". Emails stuck in OutBox and I wouldn't have known it without the warning upon logging off.  UITS has always been helpful and quickly solves issues when I call.  Although I don't like always having to reach out to UITS for assistance, when I'm in need they have always been timely, professional, knowledgeable, and have resolved whatever issue(s) I present them with. I am truly grateful to have them as a resource! :)  While working from home UITS worked with me to make sure that I was able to log in and showed me a couple of different ways to get logged in.  In general, I appreciate the work UITS does as a whole for IU. It takes a variety of highly skilled individuals to take responsibility for the depth and breadth of everything UITS manages. With that, though, I wish UITS took a more collaborative and transparent approach to the development of resources for the university. I think part of the responsibility of managing IT for such a large entity is being able to translate the work being done for the laymen so we understand and feel like we can easily communicate needs and frustrations without feeling like we're \"dumb.\" I don't think this is a widespread issue, but I know there are individuals who hesitate to reach out to UITS or representatives in UITS because they either feel like they will be patronizing or that their problem won't be seen as a priority.  In my role with IU, I work extremely closely with several UITS student success tools. I will say this as a general statement about collaborating with UITS: I continue to be amazing and humbled by the genuine interest in collaborating. I have been here for a while and know that responsibilities between UITS and campus units has evolved to meet the institution's needs, but it is the ridiculously caring nature of their staff that still floors me.  The staff I have interacted with have been very helpful and prompt.  No concerns. [IRD] always does an excellent job of providing tech service to our department!  The customer facing groups within UITS are very willing to help. I do find the roll out of some applications to be lacking communication to end users. Not sure if that is an IT pro communication issue or a communication issue between the group making the changes and the IT Pros. More information needs to be sent to the end user.  There needs to be more transparency about the goals and strategic plan for UITS.  Have had nothing but good experiences with the UITS team.  I usually rely on our staff IT support, but did call UITS once and got prompt assistance.  Sometimes when notices are sent out about IT issues, I don't understand what I'm reading because it's written in \"tech.\" When sending emails, please include a section that explains the issue in layman's terms. I think I often get things for systems that I don't use, so I don't understand what you are talking about, but I'm not confident that it is safe to ignore the notice. Perhaps include some wording that explains what that particular system does or what groups would likely be using it.  I typically have great experiences with UITS. I love the chat feature. It's nice talking to someone in real time. Recently with the transition from Box, I have had a difficult time getting answers about specific behaviors of the new systems or getting new problems resolved. I've gotten different answers depending on who I talk to and gotten passed around from person to person. So overall at the moment, it seems that there is a lack of communication or knowledge about the new stuff. That's to be expected to some extent, and I'm sure it will improve with time.  I would love to see additional integrations in teams such as Smartsheet. In addition, I work as a researcher, and we are constantly looking for or trying to adapt systems for online engagement of participants. We're looking for something where we can post prompts and participants can respond utilizing multi-media and can have discussions amongst one another. We want all of this to be PHI/PII compliant. If something like this exists at IU, that would be great to know. Otherwise, it would be nice to have something like that. Qualtrics is great for surveys but folks can't engage with one another.  It would also be nice to be able to easily find other people on campus who are doing work that we need but can't do ourselves. So, for example, finding programmers or videographers or whatever across campus quickly when we need to contract. Perhaps UITS could help develop a system that can facilitate this kind of matching. Or maybe it exists and I just don't know.  More generally, I assume there are all kinds of technologies available that I know nothing about, and there's not a good place to find them based on what I need to do. When going through the survey, there were a lot of things I had never heard of. I'd basically have to know what the tool does already in order to find it, versus knowing what task I want to accomplish and then being able to search for tools based on that.  IT-topics/issues, sadly, are one of the worst things about working for IU/IU-affiliated hospitals. Because I work in a hospital, I need access to various IU and IUH programs/networks/etc., which has always been a struggle. The IUH helpdesk would say it's an IU IT issue, and IU would say that IUH would need to solve. I believe the IT groups are now merging, which absolutely needed to happen, but response times (and successfully troubleshooting issues) have actually gotten worse. I've submitted tickets in 2020 that took more than a month to get a response to. This is unacceptable. I acknowledge everyone is struggling trying to work remotely, and I can only imagine how swamped IT has been, and now more than ever, IT needs more support staff. Tickets should be responded to within 24 hours.  I'm also incredibly aggravated by all the IT changes during the pandemic, i.e. Outlook exchange migrating. When these huge \"work interrupting\" events happen, EVERYONE WITH AN IU EMAIL should be notified. Not just people on the right mailing lists. It's incredibly frustrating to be blindsided by changes/issues when it could have been communicated better.  -UITS need more staff.  -Help tickets should be responded to within 24 business hours.  -Help tickets should NEVER automatically close without confirmation from the user that the issue has been solved. Too many times, I've submitted a ticket and get no response (or get a response but not help/a fix) and the ticket is randomly closed.  To assist in saving time for the UITS staff, I suggest a checklist that individuals be it faculty, staff or students review before contacting a UITS representative. The check list may state something - have you visited the knowledge base? Please check all wire connections to be sure they are secure. Have you recently restarted your computer? Questions along these lines can assist UITS to fine tune any issues as often the concern is something that could be resolved quickly.  Definitely need better WIFI connections in Emerson Hall, especially on the lower level IT services has never failed to provide me professional, timely, and skilled services. Anyone who complains needs to switch jobs for a day. They are miracle workers. The dental school is a very precariously varied IT environment. The technicians do the best they can without proper appreciation from the faculty and staff most of the time. Keep up the great work.  I have had positive experiences every time I have used UITS staff or services. The staff is always friendly and helpful.  Poor reception for wireless service Apple iPhone in VanNuys Medical Science Building.  N/A  Concerns-when I was hired at orientation they told our large hiring group that IT services any device we own, including our children who are at college. My daughter had an issue they wouldn’t help, & my home laptop had an issue they wouldn't help.  Positives-All issues with work computer are resolved typically within 24 hours, & staff are professional & personable.  Overall experience has been positive; however, it does seem as though major changes are implemented at less than ideal times. An example would be the server migration that took place over Christmas of 2019, or the upcoming email changes.  UITS SCT2 has been a valuable resource to me in managing nearly 50 websites. Their support is friendly, helpful, and patient. Sometimes, I run into issues that are hard to communicate with SCT2 about via the ticketing system, however. Perhaps this is an option and I don't realize it, but being able to meet and discuss this instead of trying to talk via email would provide even better service.  I use Salesforce Marketing Cloud to communicate with current students to support retention goals. The most significant barrier to doing this effectively is the limitations of Salesforce CRM for enrolled students. While I am excited that the UITS CRM team is beginning work to expand the CRM for enrolled students, I am not optimistic. There are crucial factors (e.g., staffing resources to adopt and use the CRM, data privacy, communication policies, governance/approval of ability to send mass comms, etc.), that are not being considered. Because the appropriate stakeholders are not in these conversations, these considerations are dismissed whenever they come up. We are focused on building something with no planning toward how we will actually be able to use it. If this continues, significant time and resources will have been spent, and we will maybe have a tool, but we will have no means for it to get used.  The general technological resources at IU are phenomenal. It is because of these resources that remote work during COVID has been so possible. I also taught an in-person class this past fall, and relied on the classroom technology to also incorporate virtual participants to class - not many universities had the means to do this, but IU did. I have been grateful time and time again for these resources.  I have had very good experiences with the UITS staff members. They are always nice and helpful. The people are the strongest asset of UITS. I don't necessarily like all of the tools or systems. Chrome River is awful. The UITS personnel are the highlight and strength of the department.  EASE OF DOING BUSINESS. As a staff member It is not easy to find the right part of IT to troubleshoot an issue. Your teams are more concerned with what THEY CANNOT DO than understanding how the user is down or the issue is affecting scores of users.  UITS CHAT SUPPORT. The people who answer the UITS chat support are courteous, helpful and persistent. I am impressed with the communication skills and subject matter expertise.  KNOWLEDGE BASE ARTICLES. The Technical Knowledgebase articles to which UITS sometimes refers you , seem to be written for machines to read and interpret, not people. Does UITS use anyone with marketing, public relations, or human writers to review their KB publications? Why not engage your human users as people, and not computers waiting for subroutines to process?  TELECOM. If you are having a problem with a phone, why are you directed to a passive ticket taking system? Why don't you provide live phone support? Our business has a call center within it.  NO SENSE OF URGENCY. Business issues affecting scores, yes scores of users, do not appear to impress any sense of urgency on UITS or HTS. Worse, not supporting your business users, because you don't understand the product or did not procure it sets up hundreds of people for failure. Perhaps if you were in our shoes you might perceive what it's like to be told no assistance is available to you and left twisting in the wind.  I have had nothing other than positive experiences with UITS whether that was for issues with my personal work computer in the office or with tech issues in auditoriums. They always got back to me quickly and attempted to resolve any issues as quickly as possible.  Our assigned IT support person, [IRD], does a fantastic job for us.  I really like that the IT department can fix most of my requests within 24 hours. There is also one IT specialist who will Skype message me after he has fixed an issue to make sure it is still working. This makes me feel like he truly cares about his job and goes above and beyond to make sure my IT issue has been resolved. If the problem is not fixed he will try his best to fix it in a timely manner.  No negative experiences. Everyone is highly professional and helpful. UITS has expanded so much, that it is a bit confusing to find answers easily. it would be helpful to maybe have some visuals that would help one to navigate the vast landscape of UITS and maybe some pathways leading to each group, and ultimately to their main point of contact.  I would like to recognize [IRD]. He is so helpful and goes out of his way to make sure my computer issues are resolved.  I don't know if this pertains, but when new software is added for the use of everyone, then it would be nice to know. A recent service was added that would save us a lot of money each year, but I found out about it by accident, and no one in our school was aware, but it was something that is beneficial to us and that we use often. More awareness of what is available to us would be nice.  The one.iu app and Outlook email on Apple products doesn't seem to always work correctly. This was made even harder when not on campus this year.  UITS is always helpful when I reach out for assistance.  I have had a great experience with UITS staff. Very helpful!  IT Staff is very approachable and pleasant. Sometimes the wait it a little slow, especially when you need something to function at work or when they have to keep coming back; it disrupts your work flow.  Opportunity- It is constantly a struggle to know where to go for help with computer type issues. IUSM CAITS does some things but not everything, UITS is not also aligned with CAITS. It would be great if we could have a single source request for help that was triaged and directed to the appropriate team for resolution.  UITS and their techs have been great across the board in the almost five years I've been with IU. It's really nice / comforting knowing that when I submit a request or need some help they cover, I never need to worry about the quality of the service provided or their willingness to make this as smooth a process as possible.  Thanks for that to all of you on the UITS team!  All of the interactions I have had with UITS staff on campus have been very positive.  Generally positive.  It is difficult to get and keep internet access throughout the day. I would like the Wifi to be stronger. It would also be helpful to have computers attached to machines in labs be able to connect to cloud services for data transfer, and auto scan for malware.  The new chat line is a joke. They can never help, and I have to call. And it seems like every problem I have calls for admin rights so then I have to be re-connected to HTS. Very frustrating.  I also hate being treated like I'm an idiot. I will tell them what I've already done and the advice back will be to do the things that I've already done.  There have been very few times in my career that UITS staff haven't come through with flying colors when I've had questions or issues. The KB, the \"coffees,\" and Slack are invaluable resources. I'm beginning to love the Support Center Chat function more as I use it more frequently - much easier for a quick Q&A than waiting for email to pass back and forth.  Very infrequently, I've wished that some of those consultants answering calls at the Support Center were more knowledgeable and not so quick to assume that every caller was a newbie, but those were rare.  At the moment, I do not have any issues to report. Communication about the recent changes to UITS services have been available, which is appreciated.  I've interfaced with SAV and Campus Networks, and they have just been a dream to work with, especially SAV.  Thank you for always being so patient with me. I do not know much, but you all have walked me through issues. Going step by step.  My biggest current frustration is the two-way communication between AdRx and Outlook. I am spending significantly more time monitoring and adjusting my schedule to prevent double booking. I also have to spend time explaining to non-advisors how to read my schedule so they know when they can and can't arrange meetings with me. I had to do that with my dean just this week.  Since there is no drop-down list of appointment tags, a list of all the tags being available in KB would be really helpful. I tried searching for one when the transition to pre-approved tags happened and couldn't find anything. I dug through email for a message from [IRD]and made a reference for my office, but this should be something readily available.  Most of my 'somewhat agree' answers are that so many changes happened at once that it is hard to keep up with things and figure out best practices for my day-to-day. I really can't assess how helpful they are. My regular workday is swamped already, so adding navigating new platforms and random notifications that this is shutting down and that needs to be attended to before migrating is just extra stress. I have no idea what things really need attending to and what are just making sure I know.  I also find it frustrating that we made decisions about one drive and Google drive a year ago but my impression of new developments is that all the one drive accounts will be much more seamless with this new email transition.  Overall, the staff is great when you need help. One issue I have had a couple times is just having someone available on campus who can turn my computer off and on when it loses connection. It would be helpful if there was a more direct way to find someone who could help in those situations. In my office, the approach is to message around the office in hopes someone happens to be going in that day. It's not very efficient when you need to get things done.  Prompt customer support from Tier1 and Tier 2 is critical.  The UITS and TechSelect teams have consistently been responsive and helpful. I appreciate them very much.  All of my experiences with UITS have been positive. My issues are always taken care of in a reasonable amount of time. Staff is always courteous and patient.  If HTS is part of UITS they have been extremely helpful!  I have had helpful interactions when calling the UITS help line. As an academic advisor, I absolutely hope IU puts priority and money towards revamping the Academic Advisement Report (AAR). It's such a valuable tool that could be much more user friendly/visually appealing. The registration system on the Student Center also feels outdated and old. in ADRX, it's difficult/cumbersome to schedule appointment campaigns. I know there's a long to-do list for tech priorities, but these are mine.  While working remotely at home I have been very satisfied with the assistance your staff provides in a timely manner and with professionalism.  Especially during COVID I was able to contact help and they got back with me in quick fashion. That helped during time when I worked from home. Well pleased with the service and the friendly and knowledgeable staff.  I have had only positive experiences with UITS over the years. When I have an issue, I am always pleased with the communication and service that I receive.  IUPUI help desk needs call staff more familiar with Zoom. if you're lucky, you get the right person, but too many times I have received support that seem not to know how to proceed with Zoom and referring you to conference services. I appreciate the referral, but some of the conference services techs need to speak on layman's terms. Plus better headsets/mics needs to be purchased for those people. Half the time you can't hear them as they cut in and out.  Also, when new pc's are configured, why is it the employee's responsibility to configure the programs used? I would think that it would be up to IT to do it. I know everyone is stretched thin; however, I would think this is their job.  I do believe a better network between IU and IUH support desk needs to be implemented. Working with some IUH programs presents problems with IU computers. Especially Cerner etc. Such a nightmare. At least our support teams at IU do not close out tickets without completing them. Thank you.  On a positive note, I have received continued responses to how to proceed with software purchases etc. and kept informed on the status of tickets. I truly appreciate that.  Response time hasn't always been convenient; however, my experiences working directly with individuals in UITS have been great. They are helpful and patient with me, even if it takes a bit of time to resolve my issues.  I have been satisfied with the individual support I receive in regards to support for issues with my computer or access. However when it comes to project work, there are repeated and predictable issues. For example to get a new data drop at a location, it takes the requestor contacting multiple different people to get the work completed from start to finish. There needs to be one person of contact who then ensures that all the work required to make the drop usable is completed in a timely fashion.  No more multiple requests to get the next stage of work completed. One and done.  In the past staff have been responsive to tickets, but in the past few months that has no longer been the case.  I call UITS before I call my LSP. They are always helpful and rarely make me feel dense.  UITS staff have always worked diligently to solve any IT/computer issue I had, ranging from installing software to troubleshooting my laptop soundcard and find a way to make it work for me.  As a gradate student, I think it would be helpful if UITS provided more resources to faculty members with little technical experience to build and develop their Canvas courses. This would greatly improve  the quality of the education and ensure that professors are adequately leveraging the tools in Canvas.  Overall for this 2020 year, I've only had to reach out a couple of times for help. Every time TechSelect has been able to help me by taking control of my PC. Just this week, due to the migration to Exchange Online (EXO) I had to contact TechSelect for assistance on [IRD] and again today [IRD]. I received excellent and fast support from [IRD]! He's very patient, kind, professional and helpful. All excellent qualities. I'm always glad when he's my direct Tech support. In the past, with a few other techs, I haven't always had a good experience.  Overall, my experience with UITS as a staff has been positive. I have experienced a lot of barriers recently with the transition to OneDrive which has directly impacted my productivity.  I don't have any major complaints by any means. UITS' support center is generally helpful for most Tier 1 level issues, and if the tech can't help, they know where to assign the ticket. I use the Knowledge Base articles on a daily basis, and those have been so tremendously helpful to navigating the plethora of resources offered by IU. This doesn't mean that I don't think improvements can't be made, but I find our resources and various support teams helpful.  I have had mostly positive experiences when working with the IT staff. [IRD] has always been very receptive and helpful when I have interacted with him.  We have a good ESTECH department in DEM. They take good care of us.  I am satisfied with the service and the Tech assigned to our building. However, if an admin in a different building submits a request, the Tech for that building receives the request. An improvement will be for requests to be taken care of by the Tech for the building that needs the service and not the  Tech at the admin's location.  When I was due for a computer replacement, it took me several trips to campus - during COVID - to successfully get the new computer. The first two times I went to get it, I was unable to. The first time, the IT person cancelled the pickup after I was already on campus. The second time, we started the pickup, but the IT person was unable to successfully set up the new computer and had to keep it to work on it more.  I have been working with different factions of UITS since the beginning of 2018 on my [IRD] online education program (IUSM Continuing Medical Education Division), which is housed in Canvas.  Everyone I have worked with at UITS has been amicable, capable and eager to assist. These employees include: [IRD]  Back in 2018, we had no idea what we were doing. We wanted to offer an on-line course to [IRD] healthcare teams nationwide and globally. We didn't even know if we could use the Canvas platform and who was going to do the design. We started off by talking to [IRD] and it just took off from there. [IRD] was able to assist us with getting our courses on IU Expand. [IRD] , [IRD] and [IRD] worked with us to help us come up with a design model for our courses as well as create branding. [IRD] recorded new video for us to include in our course. [IRD] helped us develop a course gamification component via Tableau.  Because of the success of our initial course, we were given funding for an additional six courses. This success could not have been achieved without the partnership with UITS eLearning Design and Services.  [IRD] and [IRD] worked with us on the social login process for Guest accounts. [IRD] , [IRD] and [IRD] addressed my concerns about client support.  Starting with Course Three, we transitioned into working with [IRD] and [IRD] for design who are extremely easy to work with and very friendly and open to all ideas. Their expertise has been priceless. Being able to work so closely with [IRD] has invaluable. For us, each course has just gotten better and better. With the recent implementation of social login for guest accounts, most of our learner issues have been resolved.  Overall, wonderful job! We definitely had some stumbles along the way and I had a lot of questions while we worked to figure things out. At every turn I found folks who wanted to help and did everything they could to figure it out.  Thank you!  The switch from offering downloads of Office apps to Office 365 is very inconvenient. The similar subscription form of Adobe is frustrating as well.  My experience was pleasant, and I learned new information.  Most of the time, I have had quick responses and resolution to my issues.  All is satisfactory to needs.  I only contact UITS a few times a year for assistance with technology needs. The staff are helpful most of the time. There were a few occasions where the staff member was unable to assist, but the person also did not bother to refer me to someone else for further guidance. For instance, I once contacted UITS about a problem I was having in entering student ID numbers into a spreadsheet. This was when the university began using ID numbers that started with 2000, and the zeros in the numbers that started with three zeros disappeared whenever I entered the ID numbers. The staff member did not know the answer but did not connect me with anyone else, check with a colleague, or give me any advice on how I may be able to find the answer. I had trouble finding the answer online myself, and a co-worker eventually found the answer after Googling for several minutes.  I can think of nothing at the moment that I need further assistance with, nor have I had any negative interactions with the UITS team.  Your staff have always been quick to respond and provide assistance.  None  All of my interactions with UITS have been positive in the eight years I have worked at IU.  My biggest difficulty is lack of communication. I have put in help desk requests and get an auto reply and then sometimes nothing for days. The last request I put in mid day on a Thursday received a response that it was being forwarded to the appropriate team, and then I did not hear anything until the following Tuesday afternoon. This was a problem that made our system not work at all, so it was very problematic to be out that long with no communication.  It would be helpful if live chat was available for all computers.  UITS staff was great with assisting in pandemic work -from-home issues. Some slow response times, but overall pleased with the outcome.  UITS should, if it's not already, fully engulf CAITS.  None  The latest roll out of the Exchange was disappointing. Not helpful to be sent Knowledge base articles. My e-mail on my phone is still not right.  After working for IU for almost 12 years and having had a dedicated IT person in our department for all that time (until about 6 months ago), i can tell you that my experience in that regard was stellar. Our entire department was happy with the support and expertise of our staff member, and we all benefited from that relationship. With that staff member being devoured by HTS about 6 months ago and us no longer having that personal support, it is clear that dissatisfaction is the main experience both faculty and staff have with the new way our IT support is being managed. It is NOT improved, it is NOT better, and we are all less able to navigate the maze of our daily IT needs. Losing the person who had years and years of experience working with the specific needs of our faculty and staff is not something that can be replaced with a Help Desk.  I rated Skype for Business as \"dissatisfied\" because, as a new IU employee, I found the knowledge base materials very unhelpful. After one year, I am still uncomfortable answering my phone, and don't even ask if I know how to transfer a call.  I always have outstanding service when working with our DUE IT staff. They really understand my lack of technology knowledge and are always patient with me.  I realize that it must be very hard to take care of a predominately remote workforce, and I sympathize. I admire the effort and hope that things are going well for the UITS staff.  Nothing but positive experience with the staff of UITS. The only system I still hate, even after trying to get used to it, is Chrome River. Hate it.  I want to thanks UITS staff very much for the services.  Recent positive experience with setting up new work laptop  Seems as if the few IUSM employees get lost in the shuffle. I'm the only one in my area. The ability to access ELMS from an IU computer is terrible.  A way to mount OneDrive to thinlinc client for transfer from server, as Box once was.  I wish it were easier to know what software is available from IU and how to use the software. For instance, recently Microsoft Teams was made available; however, I was unaware, and then when I did find it out, I wasn't sure how to use it. It's very different than other software, and I still don't feel confident using it and am unsure how to do a lot in this application. It's possible I somehow missed the communication about new software and training on it too not, knowing I would need to use it.  I haven't had any negative interactions. UITS staff is always helpful.  Would like a better contact method than just the help desk request. Would love to get rid of Buy.IU and all the related junk with that. Would also like to do away with Chrome River.  Not at this time.  None that I can think of presently.  While I understand the necessity for leaving Box within a short time-frame, I have found this transition to be one of the worst transitions undertaken by IU.  Always have a positive experience when interacting with UITS personnel.  EITS is very responsive and helpful! I've appreciated working with them this past year.  I have always had positive interactions with the IT teams, and my issues have always been resolved.  I have appreciated working with UITS Techselect staff regarding IT support issues in my unit directly. I greatly appreciate when pages in the KB are actively updated and when questions get answered from them; I noticed some go unanswered. I am grateful tech support is available in some form 24 hours a day and 7 days a week.  I have had a good experience with UITS.  The return time is a little long. I have had an issue with my database for months now, and no one can seem to fix it; the person who has rights to it is on leave. No one can figure out how to get in to fix it due to him having rights. I feel there should have been something in place for when this issue arose.  Google drive is not as robust as Box; I would ask IU to reconsider and restore Box. Please keep Zoom  - especially while much remote work and learning needs to happen.  Hello! I've had really positive experiences with UITS staff. [IRD] and [IRD] are the best! Also, the e- Learning staff at IU is awesome too. The people are awesome. The resources you all provide are awesome. UITS is great!  I want to say when I had to switch to a new laptop I had the best help. [IRD] and [IRD] went way out of their way to help me solve all of my issues. Having to set up everything at home was a little bit of a challenge. Since my laptop had a fan that went out, it was difficult to retrieve certain items. [IRD] and [IRD] retrieved everything that I needed. Just can't say enough how much I really appreciated their help.  Is there a live chat? It would be really helpful to have an instant messaging feature for UITS because sometimes something will go wrong that will prevent me from doing my job efficiently or at all until it is fixed.  None  All IT staff have been amazing especially in their assistance in helping me transfer from working in the office to home. They have assisted in getting equipment and any issues I've experienced.  I have almost always had a good experience when contacting UITS for assistance. The staff are patient and helpful. I also feel confident sending students to receive assistance with any technology issues especially when they are new to our school and might be unfamiliar with our systems or how to access them or get them set up. However, I've recently had an issue with my access to send email to our student list serves being removed, and I don't know why and can't seem to get it fixed.  n/a  I have had extensive problems with my IU owned hardware and I'm never quite sure if my problem will be resolved until I see which technician is handling the request. I have found that there are 2 technicians that seem to really know a lot and others that know just the basics (e.g., just enough to get someone off the phone or to solve the issue for the moment, only to have the concern reappear in a few days). In these times where everyone is working remotely, it is essential that the technicians are able to troubleshoot concerns efficiently and understand that not everyone has the same internet speed at home as they would if they were on campus. This is also something that IU/UITS should be considering when rolling out new software.  I haven't had any positive experiences with UITS.  Service has always been great- prompt and issues resolved. Since IT is not my area, I don't really have anything to add except, as an end user, problems I have needed help with from IT have always been resolved.  Not so happy with the move to Google drive from Box. Besides that, I am happy with everything so far.  Been working on campus for a year, and everyone i have come in contact with has been very helpful.  To be fair, I am not sure I am an objective reviewer, as I also work for UITS. I have had almost universally positive experiences with my colleagues at UITS. I particularly appreciate the folks at Mission Critical who help figure out what is happening when there are patterns of errors happening or when there are issues that come up that are more in depth than what we can handle on the front line. The only negative interactions I know about come as second-hand reports from faculty that I work with, and often I suspect they are calling the support center with vastly unrealistic expectations of what the front desk can do versus the teaching centers. I know the support center does have turnover, so I would definitely suggest making sure that they are trained to be patient with stressed-out faculty and to refer them to the teaching centers during business hours. I have no doubt they are doing their best in trying times; COVID has us all on edge.  Staff have been friendly and helpful.  I have had only positive experiences with UITS staff. They are responsive, helpful and timely.  TechSelect has been very helpful.  All is good every time I call the help desk; UITS has been outstanding. The KB is awesome too.  N/A  Staff is always willing to help.  I rated SIS poorly because I feel that the system is very outdated. As the graduate coordinator for our department, I would like to see this program somehow integrated into HRMS so that it is easier to manage our student academic appointee and student fellowship stipend payments and benefits. Many manual processes are involved when it comes to managing student stipends and accounts when HRMS and SIS operate as two separate systems.  I'm sure this is nothing new to hear, and perhaps there's nothing to be done about it, and perhaps it doesn't even pertain directly to UITS -- but the users are constantly in service to the technology not the other way around.  I understand that large scale contracts with various software platforms etc. are an economic matter, but the atmosphere at the employee level is just a constant state of continuing education, certification, recertification, trial and error, painful switch over -- all to stay abreast and accommodate some technology move that is ever at best a side ways move to a new different system. While things largely don't get worse, they don't get better... they just get more.  I have only had great experience with UITS staff, particularly [IRD] from the SOShelp account. She is my go-to help when it comes to UITS. She's the best.  The roll out of Microsoft Exchange to online was a cluster! Needed much longer notice than a week.  I enjoy working with TechSelect for my desktop needs and other system issues.  n/a  I have had only good experiences with UITS.  It would be beneficial to know what services are covered by our department MMGE IT, HTS, and IUTS. As a user I spend a great deal of time getting a request to the correct person.  PLEASE find a way to integrate IU and IU Health IT.  [IRD] is who has been my UITS staff contact, and he is always wonderful. He is on time, responds with helpful information, and is always doing whatever it takes to help us navigate these always changing times. We are so thankful for him!  My only qualms with Kaltura is that it is more of a media dump to the best of my knowledge. I wish it were a little more organized. This may be a function we just are not aware of or using to the best of its ability.  I ranked the parking portal low because when the pandemic started I tried to get on there and ask some questions about parking, and the only option was to pay a ticket. I never really got my questions answered. I admittedly didn't put a lot of effort into follow up, but it was just frustrating at the time because the actual office was closed.  UITS has always been very helpful with issues that I’ve had in the past. In regards to issues out of their control, I’ve never received negative or unhelpful support from UITS.  No negatives, staff always respond online fast. Greet when in person.  They responded to my request quickly and provided the correct link I needed to request something be changed with the phone. When I attempted to fill out the request form at the other link I received errors twice. So I have not been able to submit the request to the appropriate department.  [IRD]is amazing. He helped us with our first Zoom webinar, and I truly wish you could clone him for all of your UITS staff!  My interactions with UITS staff have been almost universally positive. They're usually available quite quickly, they're helpful, and they're great at using non-tech-speak with laypeople like me. I've worked at other organizations that didn't have this level of support, so I know what a valuable resource UITS is.  I have never had a bad experience with IT, They are always ready and willing to help!  Overall, all IT staff that I have interacted with have been gracious and friendly in dealing with my work's IT needs, which is greatly appreciated. Our local IT staff is incredibly responsive and friendly to work with!  I have also at times had poor experiences with UITS staff as well; however, these are typically few and far between. I once interacted with a very lax and unprofessional staff when calling to ask for help over the phone and another who made me wait 35 minutes for a very simple request at the walk-in center when I was the only person there, to the point I had to leave without the information requested.  At times, it is difficult and frustrating to know who/where within UITS you need to direct specific questions. I often feel that UITS is rather disjointed, and it's hard to find experts in the particular platforms and services needed. It seems that often UITS staff doesn't even know about other departments within the system. Additionally, some departments seem to intentionally make it difficult to reach them, especially for emergent and immediate needs by not listing a contact phone number.  The KB in my opinion is not at all user friendly and far too clunky and technical for someone who is looking for quick help.  My interactions with UITS staff are fine. In regards to services, I get very negative feedback from colleagues in regards to Box being retired. Most users find One Drive horrible and confusing. I'm a bit more tech savvy than most and I can say that it does NOT work as an effective file sharing system as effectively as Box, or even Google Drive. However, I work for the IU School of Medicine, and they prefer we use the One Drive system - which is extremely inadequate for our program's needs.  The biggest issue I have noticed is that now all of our IT requests are pretty specialized to our department, and UITS main hub can't address our concerns. This means every request gets routed to the main hub before being forwarded to our IT department. This means now every request takes longer than it did previously.  I have been working with [IRD] and [IRD] on the transition from using Inlighten to IU Expand. They have been beyond helpful in getting this set up under a tight deadline. I really appreciate all their time and effort.  I believe the staff are attentive and try to answer the questions as best as they can. I do really appreciate this resource and having the ability to call if need be.  n/a  I have been using VPN to connect in remotely since mid-March, and there have been issues with it being slow, or crashing. I understand that there was a huge uptick in use with everyone working remotely, but it has been frustrating, especially during deadlines. I do not have a work laptop, so I have to rely on VPN to connect in to my desktop on campus, so I can access my files.  The staff is very responsive with questions or problems.  Some of the services response time lacks efficiency. You may get a ticket, but sometimes you may never see a response until it is too late.  No issues I can think of. Transition from CAITS to HTS was different.  The most recent issue I have was within the past week, the network speed has been extremely slow in the IB building. I placed an HTS ticket, not sure if this is escalated to UITS. Being able to access shared folders seems to take longer than usual.  Positive experiences with IT - usually very quick response time, and overall I've always been pleased with the service.  I realize the overall challenges that you have in keeping all systems up to date, but the amount of system/platform changes that were forced on us during this pandemic and working from home is so so so frustrating. The web server, Box, group accounts, Exchange, forms, etc. - too much.  Overall, very pleased with service! UITS staff is very friendly and patient. Only in a few circumstances did my issue not get resolved, and I needed to follow up again.  I love our IT staff, they are always helpful.  I feel like the occasional email updates from UITS are helpful—they are not sent too often and are simple to read.  Everyone has always been very pleasant and helpful. I don't have a problem with anyone at UITS; I just wish they would've had a mandatory date that everyone had to migrate to use IU.edu email instead of IUPUI. When the Office 365 migration took place it messed up my computer, and I am still having issues which hopefully will be fixed after this weekend. The technician that is helping me has been great!!  I have not had a lot of experience with UITS team members, but I do appreciate that they are quick to solve problems and get me whatever I need! When ordering my Work from home equipment, there was lots of communication, and I appreciated that!  I have not used UITS services much, but I had a positive experience while trying to build a website for our research team. I do not know anything about building websites, and the UITS representatives I spoke with over email were very kind, patient, and helpful about the process. I am still in need of more guidance and will be reaching out to UITS again for help soon because of this positive experience.  I will say, however, that the DIY knowledge base is quite confusing for someone who does not have a lot of computer experience, as certain terms are used interchangeably, and it is confusing why there are multiple different accounts for the same purpose (for example, with sitehosting). Video tutorials of common issues like this would be super helpful (sorry if they exist and I just haven't seen them!).  The UITS Support Desk team has been remarkable over this past year. I work on the frontline for the IUPUI Center for Teaching and Learning and have to report that I no longer receive the comments from faculty \"I called the Support Desk and no one there could help me with my Canvas questions.\" Even when a faculty or staff is referred to the CTL now, they are very positive about the Support Desk person they spoke with and can usually better articulate what they need with the help of the Support Desk person.  I also work frequently with [IRD] and other embers of the UITS Telecommunications team, and they are incredibly responsive and helpful.  One serious concern I have is that the Skype messaging has been a nightmare since the migration began. I manage the frontline email and telephone for the Center and changes to the Skype messages has made my job much, much more difficult. I can no longer track who has answered a call, and I no longer can see or track the information that used to display on answered or missed calls. I'd really welcome the opportunity to share examples. Hoping that this is being given a high priority to fix since I understand from colleagues across the campus that our office is not the only one who is struggling with the loss of functionality.  I think the current system in facilities is great. I have been told team leads may be taken away. I feel this is a mistake. The team lead position is a minor advancement to help both the upper management and the employee to find out if they are management material. I have noticed when a position from upper management came available it was filled by a person from outside. I admire a company that promotes from within and dropping the team lead will just make it more difficult for an average person to move up.  No  IUAnyWare and other institutional software is very beneficial and appreciated. UITS itself is too big, with too many units that do not communicate with each other. One group may be asked to investigate a solution while a decision is being made to move forward with another solution, thus wasting time of others. IU needs a centralized file storage system capable of storing all levels of data so faculty and staff do not have to look in multiple locations for their files. Moving from Box to Teams, Sharepoint, Google, etc. has made things much more complicated for most. Also, there are too many changes and migrations happening all at one time, at very inconvenient times of the year.  Have a UITS reprsenative for each school.  UITS seems so vast that I'm honestly not sure when I have worked with them directly. We have worked with our CC IT contacts for many of our needs. Some of our IT help has been absorbed by HTS -- and this seems to be successful, but if I'm in a hurry I like to call directly.  I also worked with IU eLearning Team to assist with finding out about using Adobe Sign for research signatures. If that does not fall under UITS, then this survey can be disregarded. Knowledge base was useful in this regard.  The new Hiring Manager site is not super easy to navigate and I wish it would not default to viewing candidates for such a brief time period.  My experience with UITS (and EITS) is generally positive. The staff are flexible and helpful no matter what problem I throw at them.  I have had positive experiences working with UITS when I previously utilized their support at the IT 129 (pre-pandemic).  I have used IUANYWARE and IUWARE along with the Knowledge Base.  I felt that the services are excellent though more guidance on utilization of IUWARE software would be helpful.  I thought the Knowledge Base covers much of what I wanted, but many times my issues were not resolved --especially recently with the migration from EXCHANGE.  I thought the timing (winter session when many of us were remoting in) and the continued issues I am having with the migration caused challenges for my daily work operations.  I have had positive interactions with UITS staff. They have been helpful. My top priority right now is successfully faxing from home. There are mixed messages about the security of it and how to access it.  Generally when I've reached out for tech support the team has been very helpful. They are resourceful and find the answers needed. One of the technology issues I, and I think many people, am struggling with is all of the places documents can be stored now. It used to be just our office drives and Box. Now it's office drives, OneDrive, and Google Drive. And when I login to Google it can be a struggle to distinguish between my personal gmail account and the IU account. We selected OneDrive as our office primary account but the files that transitioned from Box only seem to be ones I own. I lost connection to other shared folders. It's just a mess.  I have always had positive experiences working with UITS.  Are UITS staff and IUSM IT the same group?  UITS staff have always been very courteous and helpful when contacted in the past.  I have worked with several workgroups across IU. I have found them very helpful overall to the issues my center may be facing.  All of my interactions have been positive and helpful.  The switch from department IT to school IT has been difficult. When it was within the department a relationship with the IT staff could be developed.  I believe there are systems that are available that we don't use that could be useful. I also feel that we don't optimize the systems we use.  Information is often presented in such a broad way it is difficult to know if it applies to my group.  N/A  We have expressed communication and slow response times with our IT support here recently. As well, when getting SSSP submitted and reviewed, it took way too long, and way too many follow-ups on our part to get an answer. WE work in research, and a lot of what we do is time sensitive, so it hinders our research work.  During recent mitigations, not much information was sent out, and when it is, it isn't really in lay terms to state how it will impact us, so it is frequently overlooked by our Center faculty and staff.  Everyone at UITS has been professional, knowledgeable, and friendly.  EITS has been very responsive to my needs whenever I have any computing issues.  There aren't any negative experiences. I receive emails about updates, and there's clear instructions to receive support if needed.  I have had positive interactions with UITS, mainly with issues that can be fixed via phone and remote connection; however, issues that require in-person services often take quite a while to set up/coordinate and complete.  Generally quick and friendly assistance with any requests or issues.  Generally, the UITS staff is helpful and pleasant to interact with.  If there had been more informational videos and guides for the migration of files from Box to One Drive or Google Drive, that would have been appreciated.  I have had nothing but good experiences with UITS staff members.  Centralized IT help is not helpful for the IUSM or DOM. If I fill out a request and the person who answers/responds is from another campus, it's very frustrating to try and decipher what the problem is, because i have recurring problems, and if the technician has handled it previously, it is handled more efficiently.  I am unable to access Eduroam wifi on my phone when I'm on campus. it will not take my credentials. I am unable to sign into IU Google because it says I do not have authority.  The system will ask for my credentials and then lock me out of the system without notice, and I can't get back in, nor can I reach anyone to resolve.  These issues have been raised previously without resolution or resolve, then reoccur. Very frustrating and inefficient work environment.  No interactions for awhile.   ### Undergraduate responses:  I am happy with my experiences with UITS staff.  All my experiences with IT staff have been positive and helpful.  No, I have not had any interactions with the UITS staff or the services provided, so I have no thoughts on the subject.  Late to respond to concerns.  Many technical difficulties with the fall semester lock down browser and Canvas sites.  Most of my experiences with IT at IUPUI have been positive, and I have few recommendations to make in that area. However, I would like to suggest that the IT department hold some sort of training for professors to instruct them how to use cites like Canvas more efficiently and in a way that improves the student experience with it, and also to create a more unified experience.  IT is helpful but could explain things better.  NA  They always have an answer when I have called with questions in the past.  I once had an issue with my email that they resolved pretty quickly. They provided me with necessary steps and contact information of anyone I needed to get ahold of.  Overall, I have been very happy with the IT staff. They have always been prompt, courteous, and super helpful, particularly when my issue may have been a bit complicated.  I think that UITS staff are very helpful. I also think that they are very knowledgeable about IT related things.  The service had been good.  UITS staff was quick to respond to my issue and explained it in a manner that I understood.  The UI in most of the one.iu features are not user friendly or easily navigable. Explanations for each button upon hovering or on the side would be nice. Similar with parking. Desktops needing to be higher performance for VR are slow and memory is uber full.  WIFI can be slow in ET, LD basements on personal devices--sucks for using DUO. Using tophat for tests should be illegal; its pretty buggy even in normal use.  ET 3d print lab has never responded to emails .  I have gotten help connecting to Zoom and with my email address. I am satisfied with the services that UITS provides. WIFI on campus can be a little patchy at times, and duo and Zoom don't always function properly. There is no option to change my on campus meal plan even after emailing about it. One.IU is a little hard to navigate, and I don't know who to contact when things do not run as planned.  All are good in my opinion! There are just a few things that need to be improved.  They took awhile to get back to me, but I feel like that is understandable because of how many issues people are probably having this year.  UITS has always been very helpful in sending reminder emails about files transferring from Box to Google Drive, and I have never had an issue with Zoom during virtual learning. I am very satisfied with the software available through IUWare and IUAnyware, except that I recently learned that access to PRISM software would be helpful for me in the lab I work in.  Many positive interactions with UITS staff!  I also really liked how the IT building used to have a 24hr computer lab. It was really helpful, and the people working overnight were really helpful in helping whenever there were issues with Canvas and whatnot. I know this service closed a little before COVID started, but I would really like the reconsideration of having a 24hr computer lab opened up again for students that may need access to printers and computers in hours of need.  I have not had any direct contact with UITS staff, positive or negative. Therefore I have no ideas or suggestions for how to improve.  At this time I don't have any recommendation to make. I like the current way UTIS staff is doing things.  some positive experiences that I had with the staff were that the staff was quick to chat online if we had any problems. Also, they helped as quickly as possible and were very helpful.  I haven't really had a reason to use UITS yet, but I am glad that I have it as a resource.  I've honestly never had any trouble and have always had positive interactions! They're very nice and always do their best to solve the problem for me.  I haven't really had any interactions with the UITS staff since I am a freshmen, and I haven't really been on campus that much. I use a lot of the online resources provided by UITS for my classes and am satisfied with everything.  The UITS have always been very helpful and the location in the IT building is very convenient. My only complaint is internet connectivity issues outside of buildings. Whenever I have to Zoom out there due to space, I always break up, more specifically outside of the Cavanaugh building.  I would also suggest making a list of where all the printers are on IUPUI's campus for when students have to print something in a hurry.  I was having trouble with figuring an application and someone helped me quickly! Really recommend.  I haven't had to use many of the UITS services, but what I have used has been satisfactory.  It's awesome.  We having problems logging into Zoom by using our IU account and Gmail. Besides that, everything is good.  The majority of my semester was fine with the UITS staff, but the internet in my dorm was quite poor. I live in the tower where there is supposed to be high internet speed. My room had an 8 Mbps download and upload speed. I was plugged in with an ethernet cord and also used WIFI, but the results were the same. My roommate and I contacted the UITS, but no changes were made to the internet speed.  For every 1 in 5 times I contact UITS they are actually helpful and solve my problem. Most of the time I’m passed off to multiple departments, and then my problems are not fixed. I had issues with Zoom that I was passed off three different times before not having the issue fixed. This issue resulted in me missing part of a class and losing points in a class for something that wasn’t my fault.  None  The Wifi availability and reliability on campus is ridiculously bad.  I have not been on campus that often lately so I haven’t had any interactions so I don’t have any concerns or issues. As for online items and IUWare and apps, everything is running good so far.  How can I activate cookies on DuoMobile?  I have no complaints as of now.  n/a  I think they are helpful. However, I think that more should be required of professors especially with Covid. I think it becomes less of an UITS Issue and more of a professor issue. I also think we should work on the class scheduling platform; its not very collaborative between the pages. I understand security issues but not being able to switch easily between the menus makes it difficult.  I’ve interacted with UITS before, one time via phone, and the other via online chat. Both times were in regards to setting up a university email. Both times, the staff was very thorough and helpful! I don’t really have any complaints from either of those interactions. I do have a complaint though that “setting up my first IU account” doesn’t include ANY information for setting up your university email. I never would have known the first time to go to Email Management from one.iu if I hadn’t contacted UITS. My girlfriend, who I helped with setting up email for the first time, also did not know this information. A new student should NOT have to contact UITS to figure out how to do this. There are articles online, but the process should be automated in some form and IF a user ever wants to change anything, they still have the option through Email Management. My suggestion would be in the my first IU account portal, include a question that asks, “which email extension would you like your email to contain? .iu.edu, iupui.edu, etc.” AND “which email extension would you like to be your PRIMARY email to be reached at? iu.edu, iupui.edu, etc.”  Those two questions would have made it so I had never had to contact UITS. Fix this.  I have had very positive experiences with UITS. When one of my account was not working, I received various emails and calls from workers, trying to help me out. They even left voicemails so I would know who was calling. I really appreciated the relentlessness of help they were trying to accomplish. Even after a ticket was closed, and I reached out for more help on the topic, they opened it again and helped me some more. It was never difficult or confusing to contact them. They made it very easy for me to get the problem at hand solved.  No  I have found IT at IUPUI to be very helpful. Anytime I have a problem, there is always someone that can help me.  Not at this time  I'm not sure I have had any experiences or interactions.  Haven't had any bad interactions and they're great help. :)  I have had great experiences with UITS. I just wish I had more time to utilize the training modules that are offered. They look amazing and helpful!  One thing I am uncertain about is how my software access will change after graduation and how much time I have to secure my own Microsoft, Zoom, etc. products. Are there discounts available to students to purchase these products prior to graduation?  I have not had any personal experience with the UITS staff.  Great services so far.  N/a  No concerns or issues at this moment.  I enjoy using the Adobe Creative Cloud.  I do not have any.  They've helped me fix many of my problems  The one.iu system could really be streamlined. I felt very confused when first dealing with all the IU digital services because they aren't all on the same platform. It can be hard for new students to navigate the system. iGPS is especially unintuitive and needs improvement.  There are not any concerns  No  I have had positive experiences with the UITS staff. Last semester the wifi network IUSECURE did not work with my login, so I called them, and they reset my account, and it started to work. Sometimes when the Canvas site or Zoom doesn't work, the UITS staff take a while to answer the phone, so my only recommendation is to offer faster service.  N/A  They have helpful information all the time.  They have not been open because the IT room was being remodeled.  Gets reply really fast. And helpful reply.  I think they have done well to help students and staff  I haven’t had many encounters with UITS, but when I did everything went smoothly, and the staff were able to help me with my problem.  I havent had any experience with UITS prior to this survey.  UITS staff is always very helpful and quick!  Had to contact UITS twice in a day for a single issue and experienced very little wait times.  I dislike that we cannot connect our television to wifi in the dorm rooms of Tower. I had bought a smart tv so I would be able to access what I would like to watch on Netflix, hulu, disney+, etc. But because the wifi is not strong enough or at least available, my roommate and I do not get proper use of our tv.  N/a  None  UITS staff have been friendly and helpful every time I have had contact with them. I am very pleased with how I am treated by them.  No  Hi, I have not had any interaction with UITS to my knowledge.  UITS has helped me this year as well as last year. Some positives I had is that they were able to look and see what the problem was and carefully, while also being polite to show me what was the problem.  I do not think I have had any experiences with UITS beyond asking someone for a push code button.  Frustrated I lost access to Microsoft to-do list via my @iu.edu email.  None  I think the calendar could be improved a little; it sometimes doesn't show all the assignments that I have due on a day.  I am a Computer Science student. When I contacted them with an issue I had, they couldn't help me with the issue, so they referred me to the SOS help department for the school of science. The issue was resolved :)  I was happy, but it was hard to find exactly the department that would help us students in CS. Maybe I do not know of one existing. Hence, I would like that there should be a technical issues department specifically for CS students that can help with issues with Tesla, etc.  I feel like UITS is very unfamiliar to many students and needs to be explained to us when we begin school at IUPUI.  I have never had a problem with the UITS staff or ever had to contact them. With this being said, I have used on.iu and classmates to help me find their troubleshooting and FAQ for the problems I was having with Kaltura media on my Macbook.  I haven't had any interactions with UITS staff but I use their services, which are an integral part of my education.  I think UITS does a good job and doing everything that they do, especially now in new situations.  There are spaces on campus that kick me off the internet and won't get any connection, so I'm obligated to use the guest. Which can be slower.  The staff made me feel worthy and comfortable when I felt like I was asking stupid, obvious questions. It was very nice to have that safe environment present when dealing with such services.  I love the IU anyware connection to the Engineering Technology Computers at IUPUI. It has been really helpful to be able to access those computers to use the software on the computers.  I've honestly had very little interaction, though the amount I had was efficient. The only thing of note is that the wifi (looking at you, basement) can be spotty at times.  N/A  Ok  Regarding DUO: it would be nice if the default verification method would be device dependent instead of user dependent. As an example, touch id as default on MacBook, but user face ID on iPhone.  I have a positive view on UITS services.  No.  They have helped me multiple times on figuring out issues with DUO and Canvas-- very helpful and kind and helped calm me down when I was worried about it.  I had some trouble with printing last semester, but everyone was very helpful in guiding me to figure it out.  I haven’t talked to the UITS staff much. The technology works fine but can be hard to navigate sometimes.  Always had good experience.  I have had a really positive experience with the UITS staff--very fast and responsive.  None at this time.  The staff has helped me to get an issue with my computer fixed when I could not log into my IU Zoom account.  It seems like the printer in University Tower is broken or out of paper when I try to use it.  Most of the issues I brought to the IT staff were resolved but the ones that weren't, I had to figure out on my own.  NA  I think that UITS could do a better job informing faculty/staff/students what services they provide. I work at the bookstore, and I cannot count the number of times I've been asked if we sell Microsoft word when it provided free by UITS. Other than that, I've had a very positive experience.  UITS has helped me many, many times. If there is still a centralized location that answers the number for students, this might need to be re-thought since we could be calling from any campus (and the call taker might assume we are in Bloomington). Overall, the IT team does a good job.  Add directions for uploading Kaltura video to Canvas when the embedded links do not work.  The game room needs upgrades and Canvas.  I have personally worked for UITS in the past, and I believe that it is a very helpful service. I put my all into my work, and I saw many of my co-workers doing the same.  UITS has always responded to my inquiries in a timely manner. The website is an incredibly useful tool for new students who aren't aware of the technology available to them. I did have trouble finding a simple answer to, \"Can I print from my computer?\" The UITS site is a little confusing on that aspect.  Also, it would be nice if the North Hall printer could be fixed. It hasn't been working since the start of the academic year.  I have no recommendations.  I have neve really needed to have help from the UITS staff, which is saying that I've never had any issues with technology or services. I also have never heard any negative reviews from friends or classmates.  On the portal for accessing your schedule, viewing financial aid, and registering for classes there are many dead links in which you have to refresh, or back up completely to do another process. The way it was designed seems very poor and leads to a lot of user frustration. Online classes are only as good as the professors who choose to post material from the previous year and not update any of the due dates, or expectations(very prevalent in music history classes).  I have had nothing but good experiences with UITS and the staff. They have made my troubles easy and explain them in a way I understand and can have success.  I have personally never contacted UITS but I have heard that they take a couple of days to respond which may be frustrating to some students.  It is good.  I've had simple and easy experiences with UITS getting my printer and electronic devices connected to the correct wifi services. Have had a few times that I've had issues at my apartment complex (Riverwalk Apartments, Honors House), where it was building-wide, rather than just me. In this case, I personally resorted to using my Mobile Hotspot since I have unlimited data on my service plan, and it managed a lot more effectively than IU Secure, eduroam, Device Net, or any other IU-associated networks for the time the internet was down to about 1 bar per service. I believe this has happened either 2 or 3 times now, since the beginning of the Fall 2020 semester, and usually took between 1-2 days to repair/correct. Not a terrible experience, but I can't imagine my colleagues were happy about it either, especially if they had no source of reliable connection at all.  I'm sure they have helped me before, but I can't recall an example.  I haven't really had many experiences with UITS in particular, but more within my unit of KSBIT  Printing services on personal computers is 50/50 chance of working. We can no longer access color printing. Several computers in the campus center lag over having very little signal. All scheduling systems struggle on mobile devices.  I thought everything was very well organized for the online semester we had, and I knew where to go if I needed any help!  Don’t have any concerns.  I love how fast Admissions responds to my emails, and great service. Very good with their job, but it’s a little bit complicated for me to use One.IU and contact with a counselor because counselors wouldn’t respond to even a short and basic question on email unless we make an appointment.  So far so good with all my experiences. I have had some issues getting some programs downloaded in the past that some representatives have helped with and others not so much, but overall a positive experience. Additionally, I wish that Gmail and One.iu would allow you to stay signed in for the week- long periods and not make you use Duo every single time.  UITS Staff has been helpful whenever I need help or concerns about technology. They especially helped with setting up my DUO on my new phone.  I’m really enjoying all the softwares that IUPUI has to offer. Sometimes I don’t have any connection at all to WIFI in campus center, which can be pretty annoying and not helpful when trying to do work there. Other than that, everything is cool.  I do not have any immediate concerns, negative interactions, or recommendations to provide at this time. I find that all systems I use work well and effectively for what I need to get done.  They always fix everything.  Your help desk staff have always been helpful and assisted me well. I have used the chat option and the call method. Both service options resolved the problems.  Nothing negative  They are nice and helpful. No negative encounters.  I was able to have a problem with my Canvas fixed through UITS. I wasn’t able to upload images into a class discussion. Though they couldn’t solve what the problem was the moment I contacted them, 24- 48 hours later they were able to correct the issue.  You guys have been very helpful to me when I needed your guys assistance!  They have fixed my computer multiple times!  I really enjoyed how patient and kind the person I was speaking to was. They were able to give me clear and concise answers. I would’ve liked for quicker responses, but I realize they probably had other people to talk to and they needed time to figure out what was going on. So it really wasn’t that big of a deal! And it wasn’t long enough to make me frustrated at all. Overall, it was a great experience!  I haven't encountered anything bad with UITS staff. All good things.  I haven’t had much experience with UITS honestly.  I have had to use UITS several times for help with various things, and each time they have been very helpful.  I have not had any technological troubles.  I really do not like trouble shooting, so I avoid technology as much as I can. I am sure there are many resources that I am not taking advantage of because of this. If teachers were educated on this to share with their students, that could be helpful.  I am satisfied with UITS services. UITS helped me download a few software applications onto my computer.  I haven't really had an occasion to use UITS recently.  I have had one of my classes that had a book where I was able to listen to it via Audible. It would be extremely beneficial for more Audible options for books. The hardest thing is to keep up with all the readings; working full time so having that as an option to be more on the go and listen to books would help.  My experience has been great with Canvas!  I had one experience with UTIS. He was very nice and helped me solve my problem with submitting an assignment around 9pm. Very responsive and super helpful.  They responded to the issue i had really quickly.  Recently I was switching phone plans, and since my phone number was temporarily out of service, I was unable to access my Canvas! I called IT on a Friday night and was not expecting any help, but they helped me get duo set up and gave me a backup password that would work for a few days so that I could get my homework done, and I am very grateful.  So far I have enjoyed my experience.  The Wi-FI works nearly everywhere on campus.  Some websites like the IU Secure site where we upload financial aid documents do not support mobile browsers.  Navigating the university's home page is an awful experience. Even with so many people online, Canvas and Zoom still work well.  I have not used any UITS services during my college experience so far.  It's been some time since I've been there, but the 24 hour lab and its workers were always very useful.  Every time I call them they are always helpful.  I have not had any negative interactions. All of them have been positive for the most part!  A thought that i have is to exempt the Butler students from covid testing. I have only had positive experiences with the tech department. I haven't really talked to anyone.  I have not yet interacted with the UITS staff, so I cannot speak about them.  n/a  You guys are pretty on top of things! No complaints.  Nerds  So far i have had nothing but positive experiences with UITS. Everyone has been very kind and helpful!  They usually have solved my problems within that same day. The only negative comment i have is that the waiting time to get in contact with someone always takes longer than the actual call.  I have no negative concerns or feedbacks regarding the UITS service yet. In fact, the Duo Mobile which may be managed by UITS is super safe.  N/a  I cannot access my school email on my mobile phone at all; that is probably my only complaint.  All my interactions with UITS have been very positive! I appreciate the help from the staff.   ### Graduate responses:  Everything went well last semester!  Overall, I have had a positive experience with UITS staff and services. The only thing I can think of that is a little frustrating and has yet to be resolved is that I cannot access my academic plan. My advisor has reached out for assistance with this, but I am still unable to access it.  I am a new grad student but so far all my interactions have been very good. I only have one issue right now and that is every time I log in to Canvas it comes up with a message that tells me that I don't have access to that service. But, I can still get in when I click on courses or all the other tabs. Just wondering if that can be fixed.  Overall UITS has been wonderful in my experiences.  I have contacted UITS a few times before beginning the semester since I am a returning IU student to ensure all of my information was up to date and where it needed to be. They were professional and helpful and answered all of my questions in a quick and friendly manner. I have no concerns or recommendations.  Better understanding of all the software that can be downloaded as well as allowing more than one download. This makes it problematic when you swap out a laptop.  N/A  I really liked my interaction with the UITS. I had an issue with using DUO login, but the person explained really well. I got to know that what I was facing was not an issue, but rather I got to know how exactly the DUO login works. And I was pretty impressed by this kind of a security feature. When I used it, it was pretty smooth and easy.  I keep on getting blue screens while on Zoom (and only when on Zoom), even if the device and Zoom are up-to-date. It's frustrating.  In this whole year I have only faced 2 problem with UITS. At some point last year, the IU exchange email was not working in Google Chrome due to some technical issues. I was trying to open my IU exchange, but I was not able to access it. Then I called UITS; they guided me and told me that there is some issue going on with exchange so it can not be opened in Google chrome. Later on, next day I started receiving emails and notifications on portal stating to use IU exchange either in Firefox or Internet explorer. I think it would be better to inform students beforehand if there are these kind of issues in a feature. Because I was worried at first when I was not able to access my exchange, I thought someone hacked my account. And my other friends were also worried when they were not able to open exchange. So it is better if these kind of issues are informed before.  In the past, I have had many positive experiences. Response times were very good, and UITS staff attitudes were positive. Please bring back the customer service that UITS had in the past.  I would like to see more desk and school computer areas around campus both indoor and outdoor.  I do not have any recommendations at this time.  They are always knowledgeable when I can regarding passwords or getting access to certain IU sites!  It would be good to add a student access printer in the EL building or at the end of the SL building, It is difficult for students in the SL/LD/EL complex to print when the only option is in the atrium between SL and LD and frequently has a line.  I only had 1 experience, and it was positive.  I had them help me with Microsoft Exchange, and they were very polite and helpful!  I've had a frustrating experience with IU Gmail lately. I typically leave the email page open in my browser on my computer all the time (though I do periodically sleep and shut down the computer itself). Lately, the IU Gmail page will prompt me to login again after 24 hours have passed (despite me setting my CAS settings to every 7 days). Once I log in again, I get a page that tells me that my request has expired. When this happens I have to open a new tab for IU Gmail or refresh the page and login again. This doesn't happen with any of my other Gmail accounts.  UITS have been helpful whenever I’ve had computer or software issues. They were usually quite accessible.  Sometimes the support staff just read through a checklist of things to try even after I've told them that I tried those things already.  I've had multiple instances where they just tell me to call Microsoft or Dell.  The 2 step login for some reason doesn't send me a push notification on duo mobile. Every time I have to enter manual passcode. The rest of all the services I've used are satisfactory.  I was really impressed with the availability and ease of printing on campus. At my previous University it was much more difficult to navigate. I also prefer Canvas and the simplicity of one.iu compared to other systems I have used at another university.  First, let me share that due to a previous university experience at a different University I did not have high expectations when I came to IU. But I have to say that I have absolutely been blown out of the water with 'everyone' at IU. My experience has been exceptional; I have never met such a professional and skilled team anywhere. I am a [IRD] who has spent the better part of the last [IRD] years finishing my degree. I have an [IRD] that made Canvas impossible for me to successfully navigate since it was put into service. However, the IU team has completely through their teamwork and expertise removed all of my navigational and access issues. I feel like a child on X-mas morning. Kudos, they have no idea the doors they have opened for me!  The Wifi struggles at my campus is many rooms. It frequently interrupts my Zoom classes.  I enjoy the ability to use technology in the classrooms after hours for other studying activities.  I didn't need their help many times but probably many of the services probably cannot stay online without their work.  I have taken support from UITS and I'm completely satisfied with the response.  In the past year, I've used UITS when there was compatibility issues between Google Chrome and the Outlook Web Application. The interaction was straightforward, and it was nice to have someone acknowledge that a problem existed and when it was probably going to be resolved.  I did not use UITS yet this year.  I’ve had to contact UITS for password issues, and they were really helpful.  I've had primarily positive experiences with folks in IT. I do not know how feasible this is, but I would appreciate needing less accounts. I know that at IUPUI we are a joint campus, and I am enrolled in a Purdue graduate program, but needing separate accounts for IU and Purdue services is a bit of a mess. Similarly, needing a Gmail account, an Outlook account, a teams account, and a Google drive account gets a bit messy as these systems do not always communicate well with one another. I will have conversations hop between my Gmail and Outlook account, and it can be a bit tiresome to track them down.  I feel like there's a general problem with dissemination about available resources as well. Generally, unless someone has told me about an available service (e.g. the adobe Creative Cloud, supercomputing, etc.) I do not know about it or know where to read about it. This may be more of an onboarding issue than an IT issue however.  The available space for deep learn server is very low for students, and it is hard to do the projects.  N/A  Always had positive interactions with UITS staff when in Bloomington. No issues in Indy either  Everyone is very nice and understanding when helping answer even simple questions. Make sure all new students are aware of IT services offered by IU, as they are not discussed often enough.  I cannot recall any specific experiences with UITS staff.  I had a positive experience with UITS. They helped me for over two hours once to figure out what was wrong with a program on my computer. If anything, I think that if there are any kind of outages or programs that fail a lot through citrix, there should be some kind of campus wide announcement. That  way professors are made aware of the issue.  Any time I've called, staff have been very helpful. I would like to see more self-serve resources in locations easier to access by the student. Most students are not well versed in how to navigate outside of Canvas and SIS (even these sources take a bit of getting used to). Having a more user-friendly interface from the student's perspective could reduce the volume of help desk requests coming to IS/IT support.  It is disappointing to know students are being charged for UITS services that are not readily available or cannot be physically accessed by them. Simple areas that are limited in accessability (such as library and printers) are not student friendly, as the current method to indicate the library is closing is to turn the lights off & on while students are still studying. In addition, the library hours are so limited, students in the evening division can’t stay after class to work on projects and utilize these resources for which they are subject to payment.  I have had positive experiences with UITS when I have communicated with your team regarding software services and updates to our IUSM website.  n/a  No recommendations  Most of the time when I have needed help, the UITS has helped me.  UITS staff were always quick to respond and helpful.  They actually helped me with finding parking services before I started my first class. They were helpful in setting up my IU e-mail, Canvas, and one.IU. I started classes before my official orientation, and they ended up being a large amount of information. I have found that getting something minor, like the keychain code for Duo, was hard.  All the UITS staff have been friendly and helpful.  IU Secure wireless is always weak in the MS building 4th floor. I frequently have internet issues during Zoom meetings.  I have always had a positive experience with UITS staff, and services have always been helpful  I've been an undergrad, grad student, and employee for the past 11 years at IUB and IUPUI. I've never had a negative experience with UITS. Every single interaction has been helpful and friendly.  none  My interactions with UITS personally have been fairly positive. I have luckily not had many technological issues. The few times I have needed to contact UITS I was able to get my questions answered.  Wireless connectivity, particularly at and surrounding the law school, is spotty at best. That is incredibly frustrating, especially during the Fall 2020 semester when I spent most of my time between classes sitting JUST outside the law school and was unable to access WiFi.  Thankfully I have had few IT issues; however, the few times I've reached out to UITS I have gotten a timely response and the help I needed. I think I am just tired of all the virtual learning, but I'm also thankful it is available. I have never been very technologically inclined, so it gives me a sense of peace knowing I can reach out to UITS if I have problems. Thus far, virtual learning has worked much better than I thought it would. I know a lot goes on \"behind the screens\" to make our online learning experience as seamless as possible, and for that I am very grateful. Please keep up the great work, and God bless!!  No negative comments so far.  I do not have any at the moment. I have yet to have any experiences with them.  I have been at IU for 5 years now (4 in bloomington, 1 in indy) and have had all positive experiences with UITS. Nearly all issues have been solved efficiently and effectively.  For Zoom communications I rated it as very satisfied, because I am, but with the virtual learning going as long as it has, I highly advocate for the university to cover Zoom pro for graduate students. We are frequently needing to host meetings with multiple professional individuals, and this is a large expense to have to cover from a personal budget.  I have not had too many interactions with UITS.  What does UITS stand for? I don't know what I am doing a survey on.  None  Over the phone explanations/answers are usually easier to understand than e-mail ones.  Staff is helpful and patient, but I do not always get the help or answers I need.  I hope UITS helps me with the OS installation. But i have called the UITS support and no possible help.  As a staff member and a student I am not always clear on what I have access to as a staff member vs access as a student. It seems that students have vastly more services available to them, but I don't know what they are, as I am an online graduate student, and it seems the majority of these are introduced in orientation programs I did not have access to.  Because of that I don't have suggestions for UITS.  As a Master's degree student that has been out of undergrad for many years, it would have been helpful to have a basic webinar or pre-recorded video showing the new systems IU is using.  First of all, I would like to appreciate the UITS for their vast collection of software, which would have been a huge burden for students if they were not available here for free. It has only been a month since I started in IUPUI, and the UITS facilities available in library have been truly helpful.  UITS is a great platform for all IU users to get instant assistance for any technical issues they're facing. Since it is solution based, there can be various ways to provide assistance, such as via ticketing. You may always adopt the process that solution-based IT companies follow to offer their own infrastructures to various clients and provide support for the same.  I use a lot of UITS services/clients, including KB, IUAnyWhere, and Skype for Business.  The Student center area is difficult to use. It is very small and only uses part of the screen. The information is usually buried, and a user has to go and search for what they need.  My experiences with UITS have largely been positive. My concerns are often addressed quickly, and, if a solution can't be located, the UITS staff is always good about following up with other options or attempts to correct a problem.  I think part of my concern with UITS is just that there is so much available it can be overwhelming at times. There were some services included in this survey that I had no idea UITS even offered. I don't have the time or mental energy to sort through all the different services and programs available, even if some of them would probably be helpful or useful. I like the UITS homepage because it's slick, minimal, and easily navigable, but you might consider adding some simple blog posts/user guides (maybe something similar to what the library offers) providing a brief overview of the programs UITS offers, perhaps tailored to specific majors, schools, or graduate levels.  My only interaction with IT was about an issue logging in to my email. It was very quickly resolved because it turned out I was trying to login on the wrong site. The person I spoke with was very understanding of my confusion and very helpful in getting me on the right track! I also use the Microsoft at IU which is very helpful, as I can't afford the Office 365 on my own, and without that, I wouldn't be able to do work on my tablet, which is the closest thing I have to a computer at home currently.  I've had some pretty positive experiences! Nearly every time I contact UITS the staff are kind, courteous, and don't talk down to me at all. There was one time when I couldn't access OneDrive via the usual Office 365 link in One.IU, and I contacted support for it. They gave me a link to follow that did work, but they said that it was listed as an IT notice. I remember the notice saying \"several web services were down\" or something along those lines, but it didn't explicitly say Office 365 was down or anything. It felt like they thought I should have known that already.  Sometimes difficult to know which person to contact, or end up calling one and getting forwarded to multiple people until someone decides the task is within their job description and they are able to do it  There was a lot of communication about the switch from Box, which I really appreciated, but when I had trouble and had to call UITS, I couldn't get any answers, and the transition didn't go well for me.  The UITS staff has been working so hard to ensure the transition to more Zoom-based learning has gone very smoothly!  The staff has always been helpful, and they are quick to get back to me when I do contact them.  Not a huge fan that my unit no longer has dedicated IT support staff.  My UITS experiences are always very polite and friendly.  I have had nothing but positive experiences when I have called the help desk. Likewise products have been ready and easy to use.  The few times I have utilized UITS services the staff was professional and was able to facilitate my issues.  Gets quick and effective response.  The UITS staff are always quick to respond to emails and are helpful in communicating both verbally and through email how to solve problems. With my minimal technology knowledge, the staff are able to explain how to solve issues in language that I can understand. They are also great about offering easy, potential solutions (especially during COVID) that can solve problems without requiring in-person contact.  -           very available  -           wifi access across all IU facilities is not always reliable. Specifically, as a medical student in some of the hospitals (methodist, eskenazi) I am unable to connect to the wifi servers (eduroam).  N/A  UITS staff were exceptionally helpful when navigating problems with IUAnywhere and SAS software around March [IRD] 2020. Technician [IRD] was excellent!!  I've had great experiences with UITS staff when I have needed to print posters for work.  None  To date, I have gotten a very positive response from UITS; people are so warm here. I like to interact with them.  I have had an experience with UITS technical support team via web chat.  I haven't yet interacted with UITS staff but I have been overall pleased with the services that are provided.  Keeping some places/ UITS labs in Universities open, particularly one week before or during semesters.  N/A  I have not had any issues so far.  I got locked out of my Canvas account and the guy on the phone helped me and was so sweet.  I am satisfied with UITS.  None  The services offered are why I still attend IU. Other universities do not compare to our IT.  I have only had one occasion to interact with UITS staff, and they were able to point me to the information I needed to fix my issue with Canvas.  I really appreciate the live chat to solve technological issues right away.  One time at IUB I was having trouble with a printer, and a really nice UITS employee helped me install the extension that let's me print without having to go through the IU mobile print site.  My experience was mostly good. It was nice having such an easily-accessible resource available.  I appreciate all the secure sites using Duo to log in. But it can be a bit annoying when, for example, I am already logged in to the One IU page, but when I click to see my financial aid or the library page, then I have to log in again. I know we have to take precautions because of crazy hackers, but maybe there's a way to connect everything or for the system to recognize that I am already logged in.  I'm very very new to this school (started this semester), and I'm taking classes remotely, so I really have had no interaction with staff or really had a need for services/help yet.  UITS is good and efficient. I face problems mostly with Kuali time on One.iu and Atlas systems.  I enjoy the phone service. They are always able to assist me.  I was helped by the UITS staff with getting my graduate email set up. I did not know that I had an Exchange account as a graduate degree student (I thought the email account was through gmail), and they were very helpful with getting me access to my email account.  Canvas video posting is always very time consuming.  We should be able to upload documents on dentnet.iu without having to change the format from our phones!!  I remember in the beginning of the school year (first year dental student), we had to contact UITS to make sure our laptops were encrypted and everyone was extremely helpful and kind.  One aspect I do find irritating is the Two-Step Duo - I understand its importance, but having to re-do it once a week and sometimes a few days apart from each other is problematic at times.  No I do not  It’s nice that there is the 7 day log in option, so you don’t have to keep putting in your password.  My experience with UITS staff and services has been positive. I can't really think of any negative experiences.  I'd suggest adding a way to vet the accessibility of third party vendor products. Many of these products lack true accessibility even when vendors claim accessible products through VPATs (Voluntary Product Accessibility Template). Too many products seemed to be adopted without determining their level of accessibility, particularly how they work with screen readers.  I have not had to use UITS at this point but have heard good thinks about the prompt service provided by UITS from staff and other students.  They are quick and able to solve issues I have brought up; however, there was an update to Zoom that had a new sign-in method poral (SSO) that students were not informed about. I know of several people, as well as myself, that had to contact IT because we were not made aware of the update.  Additionally, the WIFI conversion from IUDeviceNet to IUPublicNet for Roku TV owners (for on campus housing) is difficult. While you can connect the TV to IUPublicNet directly, it switches off after 5 minutes (repeatedly). Unless you directly call UITS to register the device, this remains a problem.  I find UITS staff and service perfect. I really appreciate the convenience I find in using the University apps and exchange. The staff are very helpful when I encountered technical issues. Thanks.  Great services. Responds quickly.  They are always helpful when I request specific help.  In general, there is a lot of information and it can be confusing. Having worked here for almost three years, I'm not confident I know all of the resources available / how to use them.  Switching storage platforms etc has been complicated for my department.  Every interaction that I've had with UITS (staff and services) have all been very positive. The staff has always been helpful and non-judgmental at my lack of technology knowledge. I do wish that there was a larger space dedicated to UITS in the campus center though; the lines can get pretty long at times, considering there are only a few staff present at one time.  The reliability of printing services could really be improved in the campus center.  Everything is great!!  I have been unable to access SPSS through the school since August now, which has been frustrating because it has forced me to pay for the service, when I had been informed that it would be included.  They are very responsive!  Overall, I have had a pretty good experience. When I have had issues, tickets were responded to pretty quickly and my issues were resolved.  Canvas is a bit confusing, I don't like how you have to switch back and forth between modules and assignments and announcements to get all the information for one project. It requires many tabs and lots of switching between them. Something a little more stream-lined would be nice.  I had a wonderful experience with a UITS staff member. Helpful and friendly.  I had an issue with Canvas, and it was quickly resolved through speaking with someone at the ITS support center.  It's hard to say with COVID and not being on campus for me regarding any issues with physical IUPUI equipment, etc. I will say I love having access to Qualtrics and Google drives/docs which have helped me to complete my doctoral capstone in my graduate program this semester. I don't have many technical issues if anything to be honest. I've been familiar with Canvas, One.iu, etc. since I started in my undergraduate studies in 2014 at IU Bloomington, and it's the same system at IUPUI. If I have any issues, the support pages usually have enough clarification to help me troubleshoot something.   "

    "body": "  ## 2021 UITS User Survey Summary IU Northwest (IUN)   ### Brief guide to understanding the data  The UITS User Survey is administered by the Center for Survey Research. Surveys were sent to 812 randomly selected people at Indiana University Northwest (80 Faculty, 54 Staff, 610 Undergraduate students, 68 Graduate students). Please note that respondents who reported that they did not use UITS systems or services (see Question 1) were not asked any additional questions and were removed from the results presented here.  The questions on the survey are primarily Likert opinion scales (1-5 rating scales with 5 being the most favorable rating). Responses to open-ended questions are not presented here. The results include:  For the average opinion and the satisfaction/importance/agreement scores, confidence intervals are provided. The confidence intervals indicate the sampling error for each estimate at the 95% confidence level. Average opinion and satisfaction/importance/agreement scores and their associated confidence intervals are not reported if they are based on fewer than 25 respondents. For categorical response questions that do not involve ratings such as whether the student lives in University housing or preferred method(s) of communications from UITS, data are not reported for the full question if they are based on fewer than 25 respondents and data are not reported for a particular category if at least one (1) but fewer than five (5) respondents selected the category. Data that are not reported are indicated by “N/A”. “Not Applicable/Do Not Use” responses were removed prior to the calculation of estimates, except for usage rates. Missing data were excluded from estimates as well.  This summary includes data from 67 people who participated in the survey (19 Faculty, 22 Staff, 22 Undergraduate students, 4 Graduate students). Results were weighted to reflect the total counts of those employed by the university (Faculty and Staff, combined) and students (Undergraduate and Graduate students, combined) at IUN in the fall of 2020. This helps to correct for overrepresentation of some subpopulations (for example, staff) and underrepresentation of others (for example, students) among those who chose to respond to the survey by bringing their representation in line with the total counts in the overall IUN population. Sampling error estimates account for weighting of the data.  It is important to note that some services are only used by specific subpopulations, so questions were only asked to those groups. Subpopulations of users are indicated by FAC for faculty, STF for staff, GRD for graduate students, and UND for undergraduate students.   ### General Services  1.

    "body": "  ## 2019 IUK User Survey – Methods Summary  UITS at Indiana University contracts with the IU Center for Survey Research (CSR) each year to conduct an annual survey aimed at assessing current usage, awareness, and levels of satisfaction with UITS services.   ### Population and Sample:  The target population for the 2019 UITS User Survey is all current IUK faculty, staff, undergraduate, and graduate students. A random sample of 25% of each subpopulation was drawn from IU administrative databases. The university databases should be highly accurate and complete in providing coverage of the target population. The 2019 UITS User Survey was administered as a web survey and distributed via email invitation on January 29, 2019 to 807 randomly selected people at IU Kokomo (87 Faculty, 57 Staff, 618 Undergraduate students, 45 Graduate students).   ### Questionnaire and Data Collection:  The survey questions were developed by UITS. They ask about usage of email, devices, and services, as well as satisfaction with various tools and services available to the campus. The questions on the survey are primarily Likert opinion scales (1-5 rating scales with 5 always being the most favorable rating). Most questions include an “N/A” or “Do not use” response option. The survey was programmed in Qualtrics and thoroughly tested by CSR and UITS staff. The survey was administered in English only.  The field period for the 2019 UITS User Survey was January 29, 2019 through March 19, 2019. An invitation and five reminders were sent by email. An invitation letter was also mailed via USPS to all sample members with complete mailing addresses to maximize participation. As an incentive for participation, survey participants were entered into a drawing for a $100 cash prize.   ### Final Dispositions and Response Rates:  Table 1 below indicates the population and sample size (the number of surveys originally sent out to the randomly selected individuals), the number of actual responses, and the percentage of responses received by subpopulation. Population sizes were obtained from University Institutional Research and Reporting. A questionnaire was categorized as a respondent if at least three questions were answered.  Final dispositions for all cases were classified according to The American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR). 2016. Standard Definitions: Final Dispositions of Case Codes and Outcome Rates for Surveys. 9th edition. Table 2 itemizes final dispositions and the AAPOR Response Rate, RR2.  AAPOR Response Rate 2 is calculated using the following formula:  \\(RR2 = {(I+P) \\over (I+P) + (R+NC+O) + (UH+UO)}\\)  AAPOR Response Rate 2  14.4%   ## Weights:  Results were weighted to reflect the total counts of faculty, staff, and students (Undergraduate and Graduate students, combined) at IUK in the fall of 2018 (shown in Table 1). Since there were fewer than 20 respondents in the graduate student subpopulation, graduate and undergraduate students were combined for weighting purposes. This helps to correct for overrepresentation of some subpopulations (for example, staff) and underrepresentation of others (for example, students) among those who chose to respond to the survey by bringing their representation in line with the total counts in the overall IUK population. More specifically, the weights were defined as the number in the population divided by the number of respondents for each subpopulation (faculty, staff, and students). For example, for faculty respondents, their weight was 257/20=12.9.  All estimates presented in the summary of results and in Tableau have been weighted. Sampling error estimates account for weighting of the data.  For additional information or questions about administration of the survey, please contact csr@indiana.edu . "

Since there were fewer than 20 respondents in the faculty and staff subpopulations, faculty and staff were combined for weighting purposes. Similarly, since there were fewer than 20 respondents in the graduate student subpopulation, graduate and undergraduate students were combined for weighting purposes. Weighting helps to correct for overrepresentation of some subpopulations (for example, staff) and underrepresentation of others (for example, students) among those who chose to respond to the survey by bringing their representation in line with the total counts in the overall IUK population. More specifically, the weights were defined as the number in the population divided by the number of respondents for each combined subpopulation (employees, students). For example, for employee respondents (included faculty and staff), their weight was (236+164)/(13+15)=14.3.  All estimates were weighted. Sampling error estimates account for weighting of the data.

    "body": "  ## 2021 UITS User Survey Summary IU Kokomo (IUK)   ### Brief guide to understanding the data  The UITS User Survey is administered by the Center for Survey Research. Surveys were sent to 802 randomly selected people at Indiana University Kokomo (54 Faculty, 43 Staff, 663 Undergraduate students, 42 Graduate students). Please note that respondents who reported that they did not use UITS systems or services (see Question 1) were not asked any additional questions and were removed from the results presented here.  The questions on the survey are primarily Likert opinion scales (1-5 rating scales with 5 being the most favorable rating). Responses to open-ended questions are not presented here. The results include:  For the average opinion and the satisfaction/importance/agreement scores, confidence intervals are provided. The confidence intervals indicate the sampling error for each estimate at the 95% confidence level. Average opinion and satisfaction/importance/agreement scores and their associated confidence intervals are not reported if they are based on fewer than 25 respondents. For categorical response questions that do not involve ratings such as whether the student lives in University housing or preferred method(s) of communications from UITS, data are not reported for the full question if they are based on fewer than 25 respondents and data are not reported for a particular category if at least one (1) but fewer than five (5) respondents selected the category. Data that are not reported are indicated by “N/A”. “Not Applicable/Do Not Use” responses were removed prior to the calculation of estimates, except for usage rates. Missing data were excluded from estimates as well.  This summary includes data from 72 people who participated in the survey (13 Faculty, 15 Staff, 39 Undergraduate students, 5 Graduate students). Results were weighted to reflect the total counts of those employed by the university (Faculty and Staff, combined) and students (Undergraduate and Graduate students, combined) at IUK in the fall of 2020. This helps to correct for overrepresentation of some subpopulations (for example, staff) and underrepresentation of others (for example, students) among those who chose to respond to the survey by bringing their representation in line with the total counts in the overall IUK population. Sampling error estimates account for weighting of the data.  It is important to note that some services are only used by specific subpopulations, so questions were only asked to those groups. Subpopulations of users are indicated by FAC for faculty, STF for staff, GRD for graduate students, and UND for undergraduate students.   ### General Services  1.

    "body": "  ## 2019 UITS User Survey Summary IU Kokomo (IUK)   ### Brief guide to understanding the data  The UITS User Survey is administered by the Center for Survey Research. Surveys were sent to 807 randomly selected people at Indiana University Kokomo (87 Faculty, 57 Staff, 618 Undergraduate students, 45 Graduate students). Please note that respondents who reported in the first question of the survey that they did not use UITS systems or services were not asked any additional questions and were removed from the results presented here.  The questions on the survey are primarily Likert opinion scales (1-5 rating scales with 5 being the most favorable rating). Responses to open-ended questions (for example, Question 9, see the survey questionnaire [INSERT LINK]) are not presented here. The results include:  For the average opinion and the satisfaction (helpfulness, importance, awareness, and agreement) scores , confidence intervals are provided. The confidence intervals indicate the sampling error for each estimate at the 95% confidence level. Average opinion and satisfaction (helpfulness, importance, awareness, and agreement) scores and their associated confidence intervals are not reported if they are based on fewer than 25 respondents. For categorical response questions that do not involve ratings such as whether the student lives in University housing or how often computing problems prevent accomplishing daily work, data are not reported for the full question if they are based on fewer than 25 respondents and data are not reported for a particular category if at least one (1) but fewer than five (5) respondents selected the category. Data that are not reported are indicated by “N/A”. “Not Applicable/Do Not Use” responses were removed prior to the calculation of estimates, except for usage rates. Missing data and “Unsure” responses were excluded from estimates as well.  This summary includes data from 116 people who participated in the survey (20 Faculty, 20 Staff, 73 Undergraduate students, 3 Graduate students). Results were weighted to reflect the total counts of faculty, staff, and students (Undergraduate and Graduate students, combined) at IUK in the fall of 2018. This helps to correct for overrepresentation of some subpopulations (for example, staff) and underrepresentation of others (for example, students) among those who chose to respond to the survey by bringing their representation in line with the total counts in the overall IUK population. Sampling error estimates account for weighting of the data.  It is important to note that some services are used only by certain subpopulations, so results are shown for the appropriate subpopulations. Subpopulations are indicated by FAC for faculty, STF for staff, GRD for graduate students, and UND for undergraduate students. In some cases, the scores are for groups of subpopulations, indicated for example by [GRD, UND] for services used by graduate and undergraduate students. Results are shown separately for multiple subpopulations where appropriate.  For detail on the study methodology, please see [INSERT LINK].   ### General Services  1.

    "body": "  ## 2021 IUN User Survey – Methods Summary  UITS at Indiana University contracts with the IU Center for Survey Research (CSR) to conduct a biennial survey aimed at assessing current usage, awareness, and levels of satisfaction with UITS services.   ### Population and Sample:  The target population for the 2021 UITS User Survey is all current IUN faculty, staff, undergraduate, and graduate students. A random sample of 25% of each subpopulation was drawn from IU administrative databases. The university databases should be highly accurate and complete in providing coverage of the target population. The 2021 UITS User Survey was administered as a web survey and distributed via email invitation on January 27, 2021 to 812 randomly selected people at IU Northwest (80 Faculty, 54 Staff, 610 Undergraduate students, 68 Graduate students).   ### Questionnaire and Data Collection:  The survey questions were developed by UITS. They ask about usage of email, devices, and services, as well as satisfaction with various tools and services available to the campus. The questions on the survey are primarily Likert opinion scales (1-5 rating scales with 5 always being the most favorable rating). Most questions include an “N/A” or “Do not use” response option. The survey was programmed in Qualtrics and thoroughly tested by CSR and UITS staff. The survey was administered in English only.  The field period for the 2021 UITS User Survey was January 27, 2021 through March 1, 2021. An invitation and five reminders were sent by email to maximize participation. As an incentive for participation, survey participants were entered into a drawing for one of fifteen $100 cash prizes (drawn from participants at all IU campuses).   ### Final Dispositions and Response Rates:  Table 1 below indicates the population and sample size (the number of surveys originally sent out to the randomly selected individuals), the number of actual responses, and the percentage of responses received by subpopulation. Population sizes were obtained from University Institutional Research and Reporting. A questionnaire was categorized as a respondent if at least three questions were answered.  Final dispositions for all cases were classified according to The American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR). 2016. Standard Definitions: Final Dispositions of Case Codes and Outcome Rates for Surveys. 9th edition. Table 2 itemizes final dispositions and the AAPOR Response Rate, RR2.  AAPOR Response Rate 2 is calculated using the following formula:  \\(RR2 = {(I+P) \\over (I+P) + (R+NC+O) + (UH+UO)}\\)  AAPOR Response Rate 2  8.3%   ## Weights:  Results were weighted to reflect the total counts of those employed by the university (Faculty and Staff, combined) and students (Undergraduate and Graduate students, combined) at IUN in the fall of 2020 (shown in Table 1). Since there were fewer than 20 respondents in the faculty subpopulation, faculty and staff were combined for weighting purposes. Similarly, since there were fewer than 20 respondents in the graduate student subpopulation, graduate and undergraduate students were combined for weighting purposes. Weighting helps to correct for overrepresentation of some subpopulations (for example, staff) and underrepresentation of others (for example, students) among those who chose to respond to the survey by bringing their representation in line with the total counts in the overall IUN population. More specifically, the weights were defined as the number in the population divided by the number of respondents for each combined subpopulation (employees, students). For example, for employee respondents (included faculty and staff), their weight was (347+222)/(19+22)=13.9.  All estimates were weighted. Sampling error estimates account for weighting of the data.

    "body": "  ## 2019 UITS User Survey IUS – Open Text Responses (Edited)  This text file includes responses to the following question of the UITS survey:  (At start of the survey): As you get started, please take a moment to share with us any thoughts, concerns, issues, and/or ideas that you may have. What positive experiences with UITS staff or services have you had? Are there concerns or negative interactions that you want us to know about? Do you have recommendations for new services or improvements to existing ones? (You will have a chance to review, amend, or add to your comments before submitting your responses.)  (At end of the survey): If you entered comments at the beginning of the survey, they are displayed below. If you would like to edit your comments, share recommendations for additional services and support resources, or add additional comments or suggestions please enter them below.  Identifying references have been removed from this document and replaced with “[IRD]”. Responses are grouped by sample: Faculty, Staff, Undergraduate students, and Graduate students.   ### Faculty responses:  My experience on campus are very positive. The staff is helpful and polite anytime I need assistance in the classroom or in my office. The only issues I have are with my Surface Pro which was purchased with FYS funds. This computer restricts many of the basic programs I like to use for leisure such as ITunes. It requires remote authorization, which I am unable to attain in the evening. It's frustrating not to be able to run basic programs on a semi-personal machine, when I can use those same programs on my computer in my IUS office.  The local IT folks were very helpful when I was looking for a solution to use my iPad and Mac Book Pro in the classroom, to connect wirelessly to the classroom projector. They installed Apple TV devices in my classrooms, which worked nicely. Very grateful for their help!  Satisfactory and timely response from the IUS teams (not quite the same from the IU team).  We had some problems with our computers in the Adjunct Office in Knobview. We could not log in to some of the computers, and if we could, we could not print. At least two of us called IT. The first person I called was no help, but eventually, we got help. It took more than a day to get the issues sorted out, but now everything is working fine-- Knock on wood!  No concerns or negative interactions to report. The IUS IT people are great.  I understand the security concerns that led to the automatic sign out after 15 minutes of inactivity. But it can be really challenging and I find myself having to sign in a lot during the day.  The wireless connectivity in my building is rather patchy, as it can sometimes be in other locations on my campus. I use my smartphone as a remote for my laptop, and even then - in the classroom - the Wi-Fi signal sometimes drops and my smartphone cannot connect to the laptop.  I have always had positive interactions with IT. They are always helpful and prompt when I need assistance.  I have never had an unpleasant interaction with the staff at IUS. They make me feel smart when I feel stupid about a problem I have with equipment. I couldn't ask for better support!  The staff always try to help. They will walk over to your computer at any time to assist.  The technology in the classroom is PowerPoint and projectors -- 30 year old technology. Certainly 20 years behind the classroom technology high school students use every day.  All the security measures cause major delays in using the computer in my office or in the classrooms. Having to start or reboot computers to use several different programs at once can take up 20-30 minutes! So a lot of faculty just leave computers on and don't log out as the time to reboot is so long because of all the security programs running in the background. This is counterproductive to the reason for having the security in the first place.  The vast majority of my interactions with UITS staff have been overwhelmingly positive, and the only negative experiences I've had with staff or services have more than likely been the result of operator error on my part.  Excellent support staff. Friendly & helpful.  However, I have had some issues with IT getting back on issues that were not simply solved.  I appreciate the accessibility. Each call is answered by someone who truly wants to help, and who will get help from a colleague if he/she does not know the answer.  I hope we can be informed when computers are being changed in the classrooms so we can make the necessary checks and adjustments before being in front of a class and appearing unprepared.  I would like to make a faculty webpage, but the info on kb.iu.edu are not descriptive in a language I can understand. I need simplified information without jargon.  UITS has always been very responsive to my questions and issues.  My limited experiences with UITS has all been positive.  I teach at the Graduate center and every year I have issues with the computer room. It would be nice if someone would go to the center the week before school starts and make sure the equipment works. I have had trouble every first day for 2 years, the first year no one could figure it out and I couldn't use computers, this year I made a phone call and the second person I talked to figured it out.  I have always gotten great support from the team.  I wish they could also work with us on platforms such as FB, Twitter and Instagram. Many of us (faculty) are using social media platforms to help market our programs and our accomplishments. I wish there was one person that would be fully dedicated to this service.  My situation is unique as far as not being satisfied with my classroom set-up. Its a science lab and it does not get \"normal\" upgrades from tech fee. This an area that needs to be further discussed.  The UITS staff is always helpful, both on the phone and in-person.  I have always received the help that I needed very promptly.  No comment   ### Staff responses:  Lately it seems that UITS has, in general, been very focused on phishing (and rightfully so), but my perception is that phishing awareness and the phishing program have become a primary focus.  System issues seem to have become more prevalent while the focus has been on phishing.  The help desk team on the SE campus are amazing. I cannot thank them enough for their quick response time when we find classroom emergency needs that arise.  The IT staff at IU Southeast are amazing. They are very helpful and often go above and beyond. A great example of this is when, recently, I reported to our campus IT as well as to OCSS that AdRx was crashing. I knew our local IT couldn't fix it, but reported it to them in case others contacted them, such that they would know what was going on. Throughout the day, as UITS worked to fix the problem, our local IT team kept in contact with me to see if there was anything else they could do to help in the meantime.  Additionally, I was recently slated for a computer update, and our campus has taken to offering the choice between a laptop and desktop computer. An IT rep came to meet with me to discuss the pros and cons of both options, so that I could make an informed decision.  IT at Southeast really do work as if we are all on the same team, and I appreciate them immensely.  UITS for the entire system is also very good. Although I don't use the helpdesk function often, I have been in close contact with Kris Nicola and Caryn Castellan, who are both fabulous. They are very attentive to the needs of the end users of the products they are helping to create, and are constantly looking for ways to improve.  I think that our SE campus HelpDesk is great! All of the UITS staff are excellent, and always go above and beyond to help.  I am overall happy with IT services and offerings at IU Southeast and am able to perform my work. Sometimes I have issues with the usability of or small glitches in some of the sites and programs I use. (ex: IUIE is very helpful to me and has lots of data that I need, but it can be hard to find and to know what data a particular report is going to give me until I run it.)  My experiences with UITS staff and services have always been positive. The staff is very knowledgeable about technology and they have always resolved my service requests quickly. I do not have any concerns or suggestions for improvement at this time.  UITS staff on our campus has been nothing but kind, helpful and timely when dealing with issues. My only critique would be to increase the staff on the web team. They're always overworked and understaffed.  I joined IUS as an employee in June 2018 and have called IT numerous times to help me with a variety of problems and learning situations. Each person has been professional, courteous and knowledgeable. They have been an immeasurable help in my getting acclimated.  This email was addressed to my legal name. I wish it would have pulled my preferred name instead.  I typically have great interactions with UITS staff! They are always very helpful and available. The only negative thing I have encountered is occasional inaccuracy when making updates to websites.  Our staff at IUS are always right at our finger tips anytime they are needed. They always take the time to explain a problem or issue and correct it instantly. I have nothing negative to report.  All positive experiences. They go above and beyond. I always make it a point to ask their name. If someone takes the time to work on your computer or phone, always say Thank you!  I have had no negative interactions with the UITS staff. They have always been there for me when I needed their assistance.  I have always been very pleased with our IT Department. They do their level best to keep us up and running with little to no interruption.  IT has always been very helpful and timely on their response to an issue. Staff is always friendly and willing to help.  I think our UITS staff members are wonderful - both as individuals and highly skilled employees. The Helpdesk technicians are friendly, follow-up and are generally knowledgeable about issues or problems I'm having. The web-team members are fantastic! I realize they have a lot of projects taking place at one time but they always make me feel like my concerns are theirs. We are extremely lucky to have such a great group of folks.  I've had positive experiences with the IT department, overall. Most of the time, they are able to navigate my (lack of) technical computer terminology in order to help me get a clear answer.  Staff is friendly and able to communicate issues in layman's terms.  The staff at IUS have always been very helpful when assisting me with issues I have run into.  When we need something done with the UITS team they are always very helpful and very quick about getting the job done.  I have had positive interactions in my time working at IUS. Anytime I have needed help with anything related to IT they have always answered and corrected the issue within 24 to 48 hours.  No concerns or negative interactions at this time.   ### Undergraduate responses:  It seems to be user friendly, thanks IT!  So far, my IT experience at IUS has been surprisingly positive. No hang-ups, no disconnects, easy and fast logins, etc.  One thing I would suggest is the adoption and support for Chromebooks, as I've noticed that most efforts are placed to support Microsoft Windows and Apple OS. Luckily, we can easily convert to and from Office/Google Docs, but there are a few instances (required papers specifically done in either .docx or .xlsx format) where it may become an impossibility for those of us using Chromebooks.  I wish the Wi-Fi worked for me better. My laptop is always disconnected and it takes a while to re- connect to the Wi-Fi.  Matt Ballard has done a heck of a job with the Nursing school. Give that man a raise. To make his job easier I would recommend getting some better quality computers.  I have had amazing experiences at IUS  The only experiences I've had with UITS staff have been incredibly pleasing and efficient, I have no complaints whatsoever.  I dislike Duo Login. I do not like that our email accounts and IUWare are connected to Duo. One.iu is difficult to navigate, due to the weird \"app\" layout. All of the staff I have communicated with have been helpful.  The Wi-Fi on the IUS campus is a big issue. I live in the lodges and we have a lot of issues. The internet is often painfully slow. We have complained to housing many times about the issues. Another issues is if you try to call IT on campus is sends you to the Bloomington office, I personally haven't called in a while but others I know have, and they have been frustrated by this. As for a future idea, one way that you might be able to get more connection to students that live in the lodge is to let them know that they should register their devices.  It always seems like the computers are up and running at IUS; although the speed has tremendously gone downhill over the last year or so on the desktop computers. The Wi-Fi is always disconnecting and reconnecting itself. Computers in the class are great but half the time the technology such as the ladybug thing or the speakers do not work and it can take IT about 10 minutes to get to the classroom and overall they don't seem to really have a lot of training on fixing any problems.  I really dislike the new way to log into Wi-Fi. You have to log in at least once even if you just close your laptop for one second.  I also hate that you have to have a \"push\" to log into canvas. If you don't have your phone with you, how are you going to access the materials you need? It should be optional. Who is going to break into my canvas account???  I had recently been given a notice about my crimson card dormant fee and I was very disappointed after reaching out to IT. I had sent an email with my picture and they only declined it without any information given to me as why I can't update my crimson card or what I could do differently. I live roughly 40 minutes away from campus and I would like for it be easier to obtain my crimson card.  Everyone has been incredibly helpful and respectful. I especially enjoy your online IT help.  Amazing and considerate.  I was locked out of my canvas account because of the duo mobile app, and I went up to IT and had the problem fixed within 10 minutes, they were very helpful.  Many of the computers around campus won't start up, or they start up so slowly that I no longer have time to finish the assignments that I need to get done. Restarting the computers rarely helps. This includes computers in the library and Knobview Hall. I would like to see those work better so that everyone can have access to computers to finish their homework.  The IU staff has helped with my technological problems. For example, IT helped me with my laptop.  I appreciate the fact that you set up a computer room in the social science building so we don't have to go over to another building to print papers. This has been a god send because I only have a few minutes between classes.  I believe that in general everybody is doing a good job, I love the university and how everyone is so friendly with one another.  No. I would say the only thing that needs improvement is management of printers. I feel that they are somehow out of order at least once a month. I feel like it is Russian-roulette when printing hoping that it will work. Just this past week they were broken down twice! It is aggravating when you need to print something off quickly. I understand that technology breaks down but on a consistent basis? Other than that I am happy with IT services.  none  I'm a [IRD] that uses a computer and specific research software quite often. Usually, IT is good about getting information to me when I request it or helping our office get the licenses together that we need. Recently (last 2 weeks) though, I put forward a question and a request that was replied to but never taken care of.  I have high confidence in the UITS staff to step me through any issue I am having. They are dedicated and work well with one another. I think it would be terrific if some kind of IT event was held where people could bring in their devices and the IT staff would help explain how to set it up with University utilities.  I think overall that the existing equipment and technology that is available to us students is overall good. I think there may need to be updating on certain programs and software that is being used.  I'd really like it if the Wi-Fi was more accessible.  The few and short interactions and conversations I have had with UITS staff have been delightful.  They're great.  Positive: I received help in setting up my school Wi-Fi and email when I got a new phone.  Comment: Wi-Fi is very spotty on the Sciences side of campus.  I think UITS is doing a great job.  UITS helped me with several small computer issues I was having and it was a very positive experience.  Everything with the Information Technology services seems to be fine. I do not have anything constructive opinions to offer. Except that I am not a fan of Dells whatsoever.  I have had only positive experiences when directly going to IT.  I have had good and pleasant experiences with my professors. I have received individual help from several when needed and no negative experiences. I have no recommendations.  I have never used UITS while attending IUS.  I've had a lot of help from UITS staff in recovering my duo login information and getting access codes in order to sign into canvas.  One of the major issues I had was the printers not working. I would send my papers to be printed but they wouldn't pop up on the release screen.  No I feel like IUS is a very good school but recently we did have a case were a non IUS student was caught looking under women stalls. I'm a little uneasy about that.  N/A  I have always had an amazing experience with all staff at IU Southeast from IT. Danny is great to work with and they are always so understanding when you need assistance.  The Sophos Software has saved my MacBook.  I love all the staff. I think we should have a nurse office or somewhere we can go if we were to get hurt or need medical treatment like Ibuprofen, Tylenol, Advil, etc.  The internet connection could be better and computers could run a little faster and/or be updated.  The staff has been very nice and helpful. They are always there to help me when I need it most. No negative comments or recommendations.  They have diagnosed start up problems with my laptop and told me the actions necessary to fix them.  I have always had positive and outstanding results with IT! I once asked a representative of laptop preference, which helps me decide my laptop. Another time, I asked IT if they had a screwdriver for my Xbox remote, to assist in my public speaking class. And just recently, I purchased a desktop with them, which is what I am using to participate in this survey. They are very responsive, well-attentive, and manage the networking capabilities quite fashionably. I couldn't ask for a better UITS team!  Charge as printing is used, not an allotted amount at the beginning of the semester.  I do not have any recommendations for new services or improvements. I have always had a great experience.  Nothing at this time.  I've had nothing but good experiences and any trouble I've had with printers or computers, IT has taken care of immediately.  So far I have had a pleasant experience with all technology services provided to me! There has been little to no trouble accessing any online resources provided to me.  You do well, not too much I can think of criticizing other than the requirement of basically having to have your phone to log into canvas if that even applies here.  I've had very positive experiences ranging from software help or password help. I think the staff does a great job!  I will say that I really like that we as students are able to do prints and get all homework we need to print \"freely\" because is free! That is really helpful. The negative thing would be that in my case, the music department has very slow computers. It's super hard to get in computers systems in 084. We as musician students are indispensable to have Mac computers running well and fast! And we don't have that. Music programs on the Mac's sometime get stuck, and our teachers have problems with giving the class. Also, in the lab, computers between knowview hall and ogle vente on the second floor are even slower! If we want to print something or do any homework and use those computers it very difficult to use them. To get in your session sometimes takes 8 minutes or more.  There are instances of students getting locked out of their accounts with no apparent reason--I have had this happen to me and it is frustrating. I had to spend 15 minutes on hold with IT to be able to log into my email, Canvas, and clock in for work--all essential functions.  Many students, like myself, are always on-the-go and need technology issues fixed quickly. We have to have reliable technology to do homework, read e-texts, take quizzes/tests, etc. Having a way to assist students in a quicker, more efficient way would lessen frustration.  None at this time.  I have had no experiences with technology team. The website could be a little better to navigate. I find Canvas to be difficult to find what I am looking for because there are so many tabs to go through.  I like how you have created the site. Very easy to follow and all the instructions are there if you need them.  I have had several positive experiences with the UITS staff through the walk up support center. They are very knowledgeable and always know exactly how to help me with my computer questions about browsers, downloading software, help with technical issues, and many more. I have no concerns for the staff and I am very appreciative for their ability to help.  I have never personally interacted with anyone. However my Biology Professor had to call an IT guy and he came fast & fixed the issue fast. Then about 10 minutes later it did the same thing but she didn't call him again.  My only complaint is that the school's Wi-Fi cuts out a lot when using it on my wireless devices. That is the only slight issue I've had in the last 5 years that I have been at IUS. My overall UITS experience has been great.  They are always quick to answer, super nice and sweet.  I have no complaints or recommendations for UIS IT department. I'm not sure if this survey is only about the IT department, or if it includes online class feedback. If it includes online class feedback I must say the Math classes are terrible and for that reason alone I do not recommend friends or family to attend IUS. Not only are the classes an enormous amount of busy work that students who work don't have time to do, but I am not learning much since I spend the majority of the time cramming to get the work done instead of taking my time and learning the materials. In addition, Examity is the worst way a student could take a test. The proctors do not know what they are doing, can't communicate very well with those who speak English, there's always a horrible connection, the company is untrustworthy, and most of the proctors are rude. All of my other online classes still have test that the student can do without the aggravation of Examity, and without risking their safety by using Examity.  Better internet connection.  UITS staff are great. Resolved issues professionally and quickly.  I've had very positive experiences with UITS staff and services. I wouldn't change a thing.  I've never personally had a bad experience with UITS staff at the Southeast campus. Everyone is generally helpful and considerate.  Everything is great.  I've only ever had to use the IT department when I had to get a new student ID. I've seen them come and help a professor in using the projector and they have been very good at their jobs.  The Wi-Fi is extremely unreliable and cuts out on my phone as many as ten times in one minute during some nights. This is very inefficient and has ended up costing me a lot of money in data costs as a result from its repeatedly cutting out. It can also cut out on my computer daily, though to a lesser extent than my phone.  I like having the computer room in Crestview and having different options like quick print, bring in your own laptop, etc.  My suggestion for UITS is to better promote the wealth of information and services that are available, as well as to better demonstrate the use of and uses for the various resources.  I've had a couple of positive experiences with the UITS staff. Whenever I was going to start my first semester at IUS this semester, they helped my mom and I with login information regarding the placement tests. The second time I went there I had help with using my flash drive. And the last time I went there I had help with my laptop screen fully turning on. I've never had any concerns or negative interactions with the UITS staff. I don't have any recommendations for new services.  I had a good experience as when I created an account to apply to ius and already had one for my ap bio class had to be combined and they managed to do it.  This is my first semester of college in almost 21 years. I have no opinions or suggestions at this time.   ### Graduate responses:  The IT services at IUS are great. I especially like that we get software that we need for school for free or at a low price. I also like that there are people to help download the software. I also like the computer sale that occurs every year at the beginning of the spring semester.  I am pleased with everything.  They are always quick about fixing technology issues. Thanks.  I think there are fewer computers in the library now. Last year there were more.  One.iu is not managed in a proper way. Many things are scattered. Once I use any application, I don't get an option to go back to the homepage. I have to open a new tab for that.  I don't have any specific comments other than overall it has been a good experience. It has been very limited too.  I have only had a few interactions with IT \"staff\" (usually students in the labs) and for more simple issues (need more paper, is this computer/printer working, etc.). Generally they have been helpful. As for other IT services, additional downloadable or for sale software would be nice (such as creative types of stuff - corel draw, Photoshop and similar types.)  So far, I have not had any negative interactions outside of normal computer/IT glitches. Seating in lab environment classroom is not comfortable nor ergonomically correct. As a shorter person, the tables and computers are too high (in classrooms). Need lower tables and/or chairs that rise (a LOT).  I have not had many interactions with IT services, but the one that I had recently was a positive one. I had to go get a new ID card because I still had the old one. They were more than helpful and it was quick and easy.   "

    "body": "  ## 2019 UITS User Survey IUPUC – Open Text Responses (Edited)  This text file includes responses to the following question of the UITS survey:  (At start of the survey): As you get started, please take a moment to share with us any thoughts, concerns, issues, and/or ideas that you may have. What positive experiences with UITS staff or services have you had? Are there concerns or negative interactions that you want us to know about? Do you have recommendations for new services or improvements to existing ones? (You will have a chance to review, amend, or add to your comments before submitting your responses.)  (At end of the survey): If you entered comments at the beginning of the survey, they are displayed below. If you would like to edit your comments, share recommendations for additional services and support resources, or add additional comments or suggestions please enter them below.  Identifying references have been removed from this document and replaced with “[IRD]”. Responses are grouped by sample: Faculty, Staff, Undergraduate students, and Graduate students.   ### Faculty responses:  Positive - the team is supportive of trying to find solutions to the unique problems my department has. Things run well most of the time!  Negative - I do not like that all calls now have to be centrally routed away from our local help desk. Our team worked to fix this, and that was a good thing.  I'm [IRD] with very limited hours on campus, thus my need for and interactions with UITS has been very limited as well. I do teach a class in a computer lab and often we have issues with the printer. It's practically worthless. I try to run a paper-less class, but sometimes I have students do in-class writing activities which they print out and share with another student for a critique.  Another issue I have is one of too many options. Because I'm rarely on campus and only teach [IRD] I operate in a vacuum with little interaction with other faculty regarding what's out there and how I can use it. Additionally, there are so many IT options that things that may actually help me get lost in the crowd. About the focus group question below, I would love to but because I'm an hour away from any campus and have a full-time job, it might be difficult to activity participate if face-to-face attendance is required.  The staff at Columbus are wonderful and very helpful.  The only negative experience I have had is when the decision was made to route all IT requests through a central repository not on campus. I found it more difficult to resolve a problem than when speaking with someone more personal, on the campus where I reside.  IUPUI CTL is fabulous; local CTL, not so much.  New people on phone 1317 274 HELP are more short-tempered than they used to be. The people now are impatient and think callers should know how to solve everything. There really is a limit to how much AI, self-help, help pages, and robots we can use to solve human issues before the people with problems just stop being as productive.  UITS services at IUPUC have been prompt, efficient, and professional.  As an adjunct lecturer, I have no idea about many of the resources listed. No one has ever told me and informed me about them. I was also rejected to access digital data base at IU Bloomington for my research. Basically, I sense that there isn't much for adjunct faculty. I understand but am not pleased with this.  Staff is always positive and willing to help.   ### Staff responses:  Our UITS staff is very professional and responsive.  They are always quick to respond! They always know the answers and are very capable in all that they do!  Over the years, I have had nothing but good things to say about the IT team at our Columbus campus. I have asked for help with a variety of issues: telephone, weird software behavior, slowness of processing, loading of applications, renewing the imaging, and screen blackouts connected with MS Access to name a few. If I had to dig deeply for an additional service, it would be better knowledge of particular MS Office apps; sometimes my questions were too difficult for the team. I have learned how to search for answers online myself.  Every time I've needed UITS, they've been quick and helpful to respond. I usually use the email or chat feature to alert them to issues I'm having. I don't know all of the services I can use from them though and would like to learn more. After taking the survey, help with Canvas for teaching might be especially useful, and is something I didn't know existed. I also enjoy receiving the UITS emails that just give updates about tech at IU - I am not very technical-minded, so I feel like I learn something every time.  I don't care for Box. I don't like that I have no control over content or folders in my own \"dashboard\". For instance, if invited to share a Box folder with others, I am stuck with the naming convention used by the person who initiated the folder, whether it is logical or a duplicate of other folders I have. If a project ends or is no longer applicable, the folder (if initiated by someone other than myself) is in my account and cannot be deleted or hidden. It is just not a very user friendly option.  Our campus IT department has undergone a large number of personnel changes this year. Unfortunately, there has been little to no introduction of the replacement employees. As a small campus, the culture is such that we enjoy knowing and working with our colleagues. It feels like IT is further distancing themselves from the campus. This trend began a few years back with the reorganization of IUTS enterprise-wide. I don't think it is a positive by-product.  I appreciated the UITS presentation at New Employee Orientation!  Our campus IT staff are knowledgeable and usually very friendly. What is not friendly is the new centralized UITS contact process. It is difficult to connect with our local staff who could probably help immediately with a problem most of the time. When a call is answered by the UITS support center, they say they are submitting a ticket to the local staff but it may be days before we get any response and the details are sometimes inaccurate. Would like a dedicated number or chat function for talking directly to our local campus staff. There is a lack of transparency as to what UITS services are free and what we might be charged for. Online UITS training and webinars are very convenient and typically of good quality; would like to see more offerings online to avoid having to travel to other campuses.   ### Undergraduate responses:  I have only had to contact the UITS team one time and they were super helpful and very friendly.  I have had no experiences with the UITS staff so I can't say.  Good overall experience  When calling it does not go straight to campus. This is a struggle when in classes and having major issues. It takes longer. Thus, students miss out on class instruction by running to get UITS instead of calling. Printers did not work. Students still struggle to know how to print. Sometimes the printers will charge me and not print my papers. Canvas registrar mistake that took days to fix. I was not satisfied with Canvas at the time. As a student worker, I notice that each computer on campus works a little different. There are tricks to making specific programs work better. Specifically Adobe pdf. Printers take forever to get paper. Maybe there should be someone who has paper in each building. Then when you call it for more paper, you are not directed to just our campus.  The UITS staff is great! Anytime there is a technological issue, IT staff is there to help!  I do not have any recommendations. The staff is great at what they do and if they do not have an answer to my problem, they will work to find someone who does.  I have only used UITS on campus a couple of times. I used it to get my Crimson Card and my field placement name badge.  It's really annoying that every time I open my laptop back up that I have to re-login to the Wi-Fi now- even if it's just after walking to a different building on campus. Can this switch back?  I've had nothing but pleasant experiences with UITS in my time with IU. I wish they promoted their certificates more because I think they would drive more interest if people knew more about them.  Both times I have been to the IT room, the staff has taken their time to fully help me with my problems with my laptop and Microsoft. They are wonderful people!  The IT department helped me with fixing my Duo login.  Always helpful in every way.  I have always had a wonderful experience with the UITS staff.  I have really never had any experience with any technical difficulties but I have heard many good things.  My experience with the staff and service is positive. I have not had much interaction with the staff aside from getting a new photo taken and receiving a new Crimson card. That experience was quick and painless. The services all work well. Although having to use DUO can be annoying at times, I understand the importance of security and have gotten used to it. In fact it gave me the idea to secure my personal e-mail and Amazon account using a similar method after I got hacked last year.  I do not like how the \"free Wi-Fi\" is set up for students now. I used to be able to log onto the Wi-Fi connection and stay connected all day long. Now every time my phone shuts off (goes into sleep mode) or my laptops snoozes I lose the Wi-Fi connection. It’s very annoying and frustrating. I have to continuously keep logging back on to the internet which requires my email address and then takes forever to load so I can have internet access back. I wish it was like it used to be where you only had to log in once a day!!!!  I have never had any problems with UITS staff.  It would be helpful to advertise different ways to contact IT in more places. Other than orientation from 3 years ago I have never had anyone talk about the chat/call line/etc. If I wanted to use these resources I would not know where to contact them.  Really happy with services.   ### Graduate responses:  Recently, a change was made and now all calls from IUPUC faculty, staff, and students are being routed to the helpline in Bloomington rather than directly to UITS on our campus. The MBA program at IUPUC conducts classes from 6:00-9:00 two nights a week for each cohort. A couple of semesters ago, one of my professors had major technology issues in the classroom. He asked me to call UITS and see if they can come and help him get the system up and running. I called the helpline and was routed to Bloomington. I asked if someone from UITS could come to the classroom to help the instructor. The person on the other line said, let me see if I can find their number and then he got back on the phone and said they closed at 6:00. First, it seemed crazy to have to call and speak with someone in Bloomington. In my mind, we should have been able to reach someone on our own campus. Secondly, the fact that there was nobody available on our campus after 6:00 seemed unreal. My instructor was not able to use that piece of technology and reorganize how he was teaching the class. Any other iterations that I have had with the IUPUC UITS team have been positive. My only recommendation for improvement would be to have the ability to contact our campus UITS team and for them to be available when classes are happening.  I think they respond promptly, but sometimes it’s difficult to get services off campus. It is much easier and more effective on campus.   "

    "body": "  ## 2021 IUE User Survey – Methods Summary  UITS at Indiana University contracts with the IU Center for Survey Research (CSR) to conduct a biennial survey aimed at assessing current usage, awareness, and levels of satisfaction with UITS services.   ### Population and Sample:  The target population for the 2021 UITS User Survey is all current IUE faculty, staff, undergraduate, and graduate students. A random sample of 25% of each subpopulation was drawn from IU administrative databases. The university databases should be highly accurate and complete in providing coverage of the target population. The 2021 UITS User Survey was administered as a web survey and distributed via email invitation on January 27, 2021 to 876 randomly selected people at IU East (70 Faculty, 38 Staff, 707 Undergraduate students, 61 Graduate students).   ### Questionnaire and Data Collection:  The survey questions were developed by UITS. They ask about usage of email, devices, and services, as well as satisfaction with various tools and services available to the campus. The questions on the survey are primarily Likert opinion scales (1-5 rating scales with 5 always being the most favorable rating). Most questions include an “N/A” or “Do not use” response option. The survey was programmed in Qualtrics and thoroughly tested by CSR and UITS staff. The survey was administered in English only.  The field period for the 2021 UITS User Survey was January 27, 2021 through March 1, 2021. An invitation and five reminders were sent by email to maximize participation. As an incentive for participation, survey participants were entered into a drawing for one of fifteen $100 cash prizes (drawn from participants at all IU campuses).   ### Final Dispositions and Response Rates:  Table 1 below indicates the population and sample size (the number of surveys originally sent out to the randomly selected individuals), the number of actual responses, and the percentage of responses received by subpopulation. Population sizes were obtained from University Institutional Research and Reporting. A questionnaire was categorized as a respondent if at least three questions were answered.  Final dispositions for all cases were classified according to The American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR). 2016. Standard Definitions: Final Dispositions of Case Codes and Outcome Rates for Surveys. 9th edition. Table 2 itemizes final dispositions and the AAPOR Response Rate, RR2.  AAPOR Response Rate 2 is calculated using the following formula:  \\(RR2 = {(I+P) \\over (I+P) + (R+NC+O) + (UH+UO)}\\)  AAPOR Response Rate 2  9.6%   ## Weights:  Results were weighted to reflect the total counts of those employed by the university (Faculty and Staff, combined) and students (Undergraduate and Graduate students, combined) at IUE in the fall of 2020 (shown in Table 1). Since there were fewer than 20 respondents in the staff subpopulation, faculty and staff were combined for weighting purposes. Similarly, since there were fewer than 20 respondents in the graduate student subpopulation, graduate and undergraduate students were combined for weighting purposes. Weighting helps to correct for overrepresentation of some subpopulations (for example, staff) and underrepresentation of others (for example, students) among those who chose to respond to the survey by bringing their representation in line with the total counts in the overall IUE population. More specifically, the weights were defined as the number in the population divided by the number of respondents for each combined subpopulation (employees, students). For example, for employee respondents (included faculty and staff), their weight was (274+174)/(22+14)=12.4.  All estimates were weighted. Sampling error estimates account for weighting of the data.

She manages the Honors Advisory Council, work-study students, and a few part-time employees. Oh, and she’s also a lecturer in English. Thanks to Microsoft Teams’ collaboration tools, she’s able to keep everything in her professional life well organized.  “I wear many hats and Teams is the perfect closet,” she says. “I serve students of every major from every school on campus, and I rely on my colleagues across campus. And, in addition to the many hats that I wear, I don't say no. As a result, I'm part of a lot of projects, and Teams supplies a useful space to keep all those projects together.”  She especially likes the convenience of collaborating with colleagues via Teams. For instance, instead of setting up meetings to discuss honors program candidates, Dement creates a Word document for each application, where advisory council members can add their comments. “They're able to come in here, view application materials, add their comments, and see what other council members have had to say, with no email chain to keep track of.”  Check out UITS IT Training’s Teams offerings.

In order to accommodate these functional change requests, we have established a parallel process for ad hoc and small-scale enhancement requests using agile approaches. This helps us provide sustainable system improvements and avoid functional stagnation.  This process augments the current larger-scoped projects but does not replace or detract from it. We have found it is imperative to incorporate cross-pillar input to allow for global prioritization that maximizes the enterprise value added by each effort.   ## Prioritization prerequisites  Each CRM pillar of adoption should designate a representative to serve as point of contact for that CRM pillar. Each representative will be responsible for:   ## Capacity and rate of delivery  The equivalent time of three full-time employees of the UITS CRM team will be dedicated to completing deliverables in the CRM minor enhancement and CRM innovation processes. Resource time and effort will be assigned, but staff is not dedicated exclusively to minor enhancements.

    "body": "  ## 2021 UITS User Survey IUS – Open Text Responses (Edited)  This text file includes responses to the following question of the UITS survey:  (At start of the survey): As you get started, please take a moment to share with us any thoughts, concerns, issues, and/or ideas that you may have. What positive experiences with UITS staff or services have you had? Are there concerns or negative interactions that you want us to know about? Do you have recommendations for new services or improvements to existing ones? (You will have a chance to review, amend, or add to your comments before submitting your responses.)  (At end of the survey): If you entered comments at the beginning of the survey, they are displayed below. If you would like to edit your comments, share recommendations for additional services and support resources, or add additional comments or suggestions please enter them below.  The responses are listed by respondent case number. Case numbers, in which the respondent did not leave any text, are not included.  Identifying references have been removed from this document and replaced with “[IRD]”. Responses are grouped by sample: Faculty, Staff, Undergraduate students, and Graduate students.   ### Faculty responses:  I really appreciate that tying to the centralized system at Bloomington means we have helpdesk 24/7. I have taken advantage of this multiple times. But more often than not, the folks in Bloomington are simply unable to help. I love our local folks. They know what I do and are quick and knowledgeable (more so than I've found those in Bloomington to be). I know resources are very tight and we can centralize some of this service, but we have to continue to have strong local support. They are so important to our work and, if anything, I wish we could devote more resources to staffing locally.  I am an adjunct instructor on the IUS campus. I have had many positive experiences with IUS IT staff since I returned to the campus in the Fall semester, and now the Spring semester, after being away for five years. In the Fall, after completing the ILTE program at IUS, I asked IT personnel to introduce the classroom IT facilities to me in person (socially distanced of course.) Before and during the first week of class, IT personnel were very helpful in person and over the phone. At the start of this semester (Spring) I was having problems with the audio functions in Canvas and on Zoom, which they fixed as well. Today, I had a phone consultation about audio again, which they diagnosed and had me adjust.  I always have positive interactions with all IT staff. They have been so helpful, especially in making sure we have everything we need while teaching online due to the pandemic. [IRD] at IUS is especially helpful and is my go-to person for my Apple laptop. He is responsive, quick and knows his stuff. I am so grateful for him.  I had a very negative experience when getting a new computer for my office. I was talked down to, and the needs I had were ignored. I now have an office computer without a webcam built in (I had to buy my own) and no built-in card reader -- both were explicitly asked for by me. This was not during the 2019-2020 school year, but it still sticks in my craw. Now, during the pandemic, I'm without a key component to online teaching, a webcam.  I have worked at IU Southeast for 20 years, and I have seen improvement of the services from IU for IT needs.  Originally I did not like dealing with IT people from a different setting than where I worked, because I was not savvy with technology. I am still not savvy with technology, but over the last few years/semester I have experienced positive results working with IT in Bloomington for IU Southeast. I especially like the screen sharing device which helps me explain about my tech problem. Good work!  I have called quite a few times and each time I am very impressed with the service I receive. I rarely wait long, get high quality help and solutions to my questions, received follow up information via email in the event that I would pursue my inquiry further, and am treated very professionally. I am VERY happy with the quality of your service.  UITS is almost always very helpful and very easy to work with. I find them to be responsive and patient, especially when I am completely lost. I do wish some of the online tools were a little bit easier to understand and/or to find.  The UITS team at Indiana University is top-notch. They are always willing to help me with my technology needs.  I love our IT department! They are fantastic! Always have time for questions for me, as I am not a techy! They are patient and kind. They keep us sane when bad things happen to our computers!  Whatever you pay them, it needs to be more!  IT has been very responsive and quick when I've needed them. I appreciate that in this super-busy and crazy time when I'm sure they've been called upon much more than usual!  In the past few weeks, I've needed to call IT support a couple of times. Everyone I've spoken with has been respectful and helpful. One time I had to wait a bit on hold but it was just after a large email update so that was understandable. The other couple of times, it was a very quick session and my issue was resolved.  Whenever I was required to get IT support, I have never had any problems. The IT Dept. was always friendly and solved any problems that I may have had. Let it be known however that I always contacted the IU Southeast IT Department, not the IU Bloomington IT Department.  Generally, the IU Southeast UITS staff has been incredible as far as desktop support. They're prompt at reaching out after a ticket has been entered and work hard to resolve issues.  One area of concern I have would be about the nas shares. There doesn't seem to be a formal way to determine if individuals should have access to certain shares. For example, the director of Alumni and other unrelated individuals had access to the Marketing share. While that isn't insanely bad, it does increase the risk of someone removing files from the share without realizing it. That may go unnoticed for years until one day, we actually need the missing file(s). We mostly resolved the issue. I brought it up with [IRD] and we put together a list of people that should have access and asked that we be notified before relinquishing access to that share. I believe that this should be a more common practice for all shares, especially the ones that contain student data.  On another note, web services is lacking and has been for a long time. Everyone seems to have the same story--[IRD] is the hardest worker we know, but she really needs help. Some better delegation and perhaps some more skilled staff would help.  The UITS staff is professional and prompt. Our office is very appreciative of the support from our UITS staff.  Always a pleasure and always able to help me.  I am very happy with our IT department at the Southeast campus. They are very responsive and assist in a timely manner.  I have not had to deal with UITS too often. The few times that I have, they have been great.  We have one of the best IT departments there is! They are always willing and able to answer any question or take care of any problems we may have. Technology can be so overwhelming for a layperson, and they always take care of things in a courteous and professional manner.  Keep hiring friendly helpful people.  Always happy with interaction with UITS staff at IU Southeast.  My UITS experiences have all been positive. Issues have been addressed in a timely manner, and they are always quick to let us know if a system is down, and they keep us updated of those situations.  I can't say thank you enough for the hard work our SE team has done for our campus during this last yea They have all been amazing!  Overall, my experience has been positive. My problems have all been solved. I would like to get updates the status of my ticket a little more often though. Not a big complaint, just a minor thing.  When I needed to turn in several iPads that I have held for quite some time (for use in a IUS/school- based partnership), I needed some help. [IRD]s and [IRD] were quite helpful. They answered other technology questions I had as well. [IRD] took over my machine at home so I could get my h-drive and other technologies working from home. This was priceless during the early pandemic months.  They are both professional, prompt, and VERY HELPFUL.  I have always had a satisfying experience from IT. No complaints.  Found the mitigation testing services online process a challenge to use. I accessed an IU Health screening visit. The visit was well done and professional, the online process to schedule very time consuming.  I have found the IT staff to be very helpful with troubleshooting my IT issues. I really appreciate them and their services.  UITS staff have been fantastic but some university policies concerning technology are so restrictive that it becomes difficult to actually get results that faculty need.  It would be helpful if there was a way to report email phishing attempts from the Outlook Web App. I use the desktop version of Outlook from my campus office but the web app from home and several times have had the experience of not being able to report a suspicious email (or if there was a way to do this it would help to better advertise it).  None   ### Staff responses:  I love our IT department! They are fantastic! Always have time for questions for me, as I am not a techy! They are patient and kind. They keep us sane when bad things happen to our computers!  Whatever you pay them, it needs to be more!  IT has been very responsive and quick when I've needed them. I appreciate that in this super-busy and crazy time when I'm sure they've been called upon much more than usual!  In the past few weeks, I've needed to call IT support a couple of times. Everyone I've spoken with has been respectful and helpful. One time I had to wait a bit on hold but it was just after a large email update so that was understandable. The other couple of times, it was a very quick session and my issue was resolved.  Whenever I was required to get IT support, I have never had any problems. The IT Dept. was always friendly and solved any problems that I may have had. Let it be known however that I always contacted the IU Southeast IT Department, not the IU Bloomington IT Department.  Generally, the IU Southeast UITS staff has been incredible as far as desktop support. They're prompt at reaching out after a ticket has been entered and work hard to resolve issues.  One area of concern I have would be about the nas shares. There doesn't seem to be a formal way to determine if individuals should have access to certain shares. For example, the director of Alumni and other unrelated individuals had access to the Marketing share. While that isn't insanely bad, it does increase the risk of someone removing files from the share without realizing it. That may go unnoticed for years until one day, we actually need the missing file(s). We mostly resolved the issue. I brought it up with [IRD] and we put together a list of people that should have access and asked that we be notified before relinquishing access to that share. I believe that this should be a more common practice for all shares, especially the ones that contain student data.  On another note, web services is lacking and has been for a long time. Everyone seems to have the same story--[IRD] is the hardest worker we know, but she really needs help. Some better delegation and perhaps some more skilled staff would help.  The UITS staff is professional and prompt. Our office is very appreciative of the support from our UITS staff.  Always a pleasure and always able to help me.  I am very happy with our IT department at the Southeast campus. They are very responsive and assist in a timely manner.  I have not had to deal with UITS too often. The few times that I have, they have been great.  We have one of the best IT departments there is! They are always willing and able to answer any question or take care of any problems we may have. Technology can be so overwhelming for a layperson, and they always take care of things in a courteous and professional manner.  Keep hiring friendly helpful people.  Always happy with interaction with UITS staff at IU Southeast.  My UITS experiences have all been positive. Issues have been addressed in a timely manner, and they are always quick to let us know if a system is down, and they keep us updated of those situations.  I can't say thank you enough for the hard work our SE team has done for our campus during this last year. They have all been amazing!  Overall, my experience has been positive. My problems have all been solved. I would like to get updates on the status of my ticket a little more often though. Not a big complaint, just a minor thing.   ### Undergraduate responses:  They have been helpful in the past when my computer was messing up.  I haven't worked with them yet.  So far the UITS services and staff work just fine. There are no major problems currently.  No changes.  Their services are pretty solid!  They were swift with responding to any issues had.  I have had many positive experiences with UITS staff while living on campus. The staff has successfully helped me several times with setting up and/or fixing some electronic devices in my dorm room.  Connection to the printers in the library and student computer labs have been extremely inconsistent all three years I have attended IUS. I frequently have to log on to two or more computers before finding one that is connected to the local printer.  No, I have had minimal experiences to reflect on since I have not had any classes on campus.  I have had nothing but positive experiences with UITS services.  I haven't talked with many staff members, but the experience was good when I did.  Everything has been great so far  The service that I have experienced so far for my first year of college has been wonderful.  I had some problems with making an account for a family member that was trying to apply to IU, and we contacted IT, and I believe we had a lady named [IRD]. I was asking silly questions, yes. But she was very rude to us over the online chat.  I personally have not had any experiences with the UITS staff, but anyone I know that has has not had any complaints!  Difficult to get an answer about issues.  I have had only great experiences with the IUTS staff; I had a question and got an email back the same day for help. It was very shocking to see how quickly they responded and were willing to help.  I had positive experiences when I needed help to take an online test in the library. I was able to complete it. No concerns or recommendations.  I have not had any negative experiences with UITS, nor any positive. I have not needed to use them at this point.  The IU website is kinda slow, & it sometimes freezes.  All of my experience thus far has been well. No major flaws or errors.  When I've contacted these guys over email, they've generally been helpful in resolving the few problems that do arise.  None  I am just a freshman so my experience with UITS services is limited, and all my classes so far are 100% online, and I have not been on campus yet, but for the most part, once I figured out how to properly navigate through our website I'd say that it is pretty useful and effective for completing and organizing my work and also just being able to find out Campus events and the like. I will say however, I feel like there are times where servers and other pages can be buggy and slow and not always consistent in the way to navigate through different apps and sometimes I feel like the apps open several different windows on my device that can be overwhelming and a nuisance to stay organized. I would just like a faster, more efficient, and less jumbled up way of accessing certain apps and icons on the home page.  I haven’t had many issues with UITS staff or services. I can’t think of anything I would say needs changed or that I’m having a hard time with.  I do not.  All positive experiences when I needed help. Kaltura is difficult to use, and IGPS map is always wrong, maybe because I’m a transfer student.  Haven’t had many interactions.   ### Graduate responses:  No concerns.  I have recently just started taking courses toward my masters program. So far everyone I have needed to work with has been wonderful. I don't have any specific thoughts, concerns, issues, and/or ideas at this time.  I've never had anything other than good response times and communication with any of the technology staff at IUS. No concerns or issues.  I have only been able to use on-campus resources for 1 class and part of another.  Canvas and Exchange work well for the most part. It took a bit to understand the software/tool portal. I cannot get my Canvas notifications to send to my personal Gmail account. It's set the same as the IU exchange notifications. Also had issues with a book built into a course.   "

    "body": "  ## Breanna Last  Associate director of finance, travel, athletics department IU Bloomington  Breanna Last, associate director of finance at the IU Bloomington Athletics Department, likes to use her Teams app on the field and off. In fact, last fall she traveled with the IU men’s soccer team to North Carolina for the NCAA College Cup—and Teams was by her side, allowing her to schedule meetings and share files with coaching staff from afar.  “I love scheduling and planning meetings in Teams,” Breanna says. “It works like a charm, especially with our coaches and staff who are on the road traveling with teams. The same goes for file sharing. We can all access the Teams mobile app and not have to worry about access issues.”  Last appreciates the ease of scheduling meetings through Teams and feels it's more convenient than using Zoom. She also believes the file sharing feature in Teams is better than the shared drives they have, especially for coaches who don't have access to the shared drives.  She uses the Planner tool in Teams for assigning tasks, scheduling, and goal-setting, and finds it extremely helpful.  Build skills in Planner and check out UITS IT Training’s Teams offerings.

For more, see “About storage in Google at IU” in the IU Knowledge Base.  [Learn about storage](https://kb.iu.edu/d/bhmp)   ## Storage options  Choosing where to store your files depends on whether they are individual or institutional files.   ### Individual files  Individual files are specific to you such as family photos, your resume, or personal tax documents. IU faculty, staff, and students can store individual files in Microsoft OneDrive at IU or Google at IU My Drive .  [Microsoft OneDrive at IU](https://kb.iu.edu/d/bgjj#onedrive)  [Google at IU My Drive](https://kb.iu.edu/d/bfhs)   ### Institutional files  If you were to separate from IU and no one else could access these files, would it cause problems for your department, collaborators, or others within the university? If so, they’re most likely institutional (work) files. If any of the files are classified as Public data, University-Internal data, Restricted data (such as grades), or Critical data (such as PHI) data, they would also be classified as institutional. Examples include most research data, course files (lesson plans, syllabi, etc.), training manuals, files associated with IU committees, labs, and student groups.  [files are classified](https://datamanagement.iu.edu/types-of-data/classifications.php)  IU faculty, staff, and students can use Microsoft storage for institutional files to share and collaborate with others. Storage locations for institutional files include:  [Microsoft storage](https://kb.iu.edu/d/bdht/)  Each has features that make it best suited to certain uses, and the IU Knowledge Base offers a handy table for comparison.

    "body": "  ## 2021 UITS User Survey Summary IU-Purdue University Columbus (IUPUC)   ### Brief guide to understanding the data  The UITS User Survey is administered by the Center for Survey Research. Surveys were sent to 370 randomly selected people at Indiana University-Purdue University Columbus (47 Faculty, 23 Staff, 275 Undergraduate students, 25 Graduate students). Please note that respondents who reported that they did not use UITS systems or services (see Question 1) were not asked any additional questions and were removed from the results presented here.  The questions on the survey are primarily Likert opinion scales (1-5 rating scales with 5 being the most favorable rating). Responses to open-ended questions are not presented here. The results include:  For the average opinion and the satisfaction/importance/agreement scores, confidence intervals are provided. The confidence intervals indicate the sampling error for each estimate at the 95% confidence level. Average opinion and satisfaction/importance/agreement scores and their associated confidence intervals are not reported if they are based on fewer than 25 respondents. For categorical response questions that do not involve ratings such as whether the student lives in University housing or preferred method(s) of communications from UITS, data are not reported for the full question if they are based on fewer than 25 respondents and data are not reported for a particular category if at least one (1) but fewer than five (5) respondents selected the category. Data that are not reported are indicated by “N/A”. “Not Applicable/Do Not Use” responses were removed prior to the calculation of estimates, except for usage rates. Missing data were excluded from estimates as well.  This summary includes data from 45 people who participated in the survey (14 Faculty, 10 Staff, 20 Undergraduate students, 1 Graduate student). Results were weighted to reflect the total counts of those employed by the university (Faculty and Staff, combined) and students (Undergraduate and Graduate students, combined) at IUPUC in the fall of 2020. This helps to correct for overrepresentation of some subpopulations (for example, staff) and underrepresentation of others (for example, students) among those who chose to respond to the survey by bringing their representation in line with the total counts in the overall IUPUC population. Sampling error estimates account for weighting of the data.  It is important to note that some services are only used by specific subpopulations, so questions were only asked to those groups. Subpopulations of users are indicated by FAC for faculty, STF for staff, GRD for graduate students, and UND for undergraduate students.   ### General Services  1.

The 2019 UITS User Survey was administered as a web survey and distributed via email invitation on January 29, 2019 to 8,286 randomly selected people at IUPUI (835 Faculty, 1,108 Staff, 4,405 Undergraduate students, 1,938 Graduate students).   ### Questionnaire and Data Collection:  The survey questions were developed by UITS. They ask about usage of email, devices, and services, as well as satisfaction with various tools and services available to the campus. The questions on the survey are primarily Likert opinion scales (1-5 rating scales with 5 always being the most favorable rating). Most questions include an “N/A” or “Do not use” response option. The survey was programmed in Qualtrics and thoroughly tested by CSR and UITS staff. The survey was administered in English only.  The field period for the 2019 UITS User Survey was January 29, 2019 through March 19, 2019. An invitation and five reminders were sent by email to maximize participation. As an incentive for participation, survey participants were entered into a drawing for one of five $100 cash prizes (drawn from all IUPUC and IUPUI participants).   ### Final Dispositions and Response Rates:  Table 1 below indicates the population and sample size (the number of surveys originally sent out to the randomly selected individuals), the number of actual responses, and the percentage of responses received by subpopulation. Population sizes were obtained from University Institutional Research and Reporting. A questionnaire was categorized as a respondent if at least three questions were answered.  Final dispositions for all cases were classified according to The American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR). 2016. Standard Definitions: Final Dispositions of Case Codes and Outcome Rates for Surveys. 9th edition. Table 2 itemizes final dispositions and the AAPOR Response Rate, RR2.  AAPOR Response Rate 2 is calculated using the following formula:  \\(RR2 = {(I+P) \\over (I+P) + (R+NC+O) + (UH+UO)}\\)  AAPOR Response Rate 2  12.4%   ## Weights:  Results were weighted to reflect the total counts of faculty, staff, undergraduate students, and graduate students at IUPUI in the fall of 2018 (shown in Table 1). This helps to correct for overrepresentation of some subpopulations (for example, staff) and underrepresentation of others (for example, students) among those who chose to respond to the survey by bringing their representation in line with the total counts in the overall IUPUI population. More specifically, the weights were defined as the number in the population divided by the number of respondents for each subpopulation (faculty, staff, etc.). For example, for faculty respondents, their weight was 4,422/131=33.8.  All estimates presented in the summary of results and in Tableau have been weighted. Sampling error estimates account for weighting of the data.  For additional information or questions about administration of the survey, please contact csr@indiana.edu . "

    "body": "  ## 2021 IUPUI User Survey – Methods Summary  UITS at Indiana University contracts with the IU Center for Survey Research (CSR) to conduct a biennial survey aimed at assessing current usage, awareness, and levels of satisfaction with UITS services.   ### Population and Sample:  The target population for the 2021 UITS User Survey is all current IUPUI faculty, staff, undergraduate, and graduate students. A random sample of 25% of each subpopulation was drawn from IU administrative databases. The university databases should be highly accurate and complete in providing coverage of the target population. The 2021 UITS User Survey was administered as a web survey and distributed via email invitation on January 27, 2021 to 8,089 randomly selected people at IUPUI (897 Faculty, 1,147 Staff, 4,095 Undergraduate students, 1,950 Graduate students).   ### Questionnaire and Data Collection:  The survey questions were developed by UITS. They ask about usage of email, devices, and services, as well as satisfaction with various tools and services available to the campus. The questions on the survey are primarily Likert opinion scales (1-5 rating scales with 5 always being the most favorable rating). Most questions include an “N/A” or “Do not use” response option. The survey was programmed in Qualtrics and thoroughly tested by CSR and UITS staff. The survey was administered in English only.  The field period for the 2021 UITS User Survey was January 27, 2021 through March 1, 2021. An invitation and five reminders were sent by email to maximize participation. As an incentive for participation, survey participants were entered into a drawing for one of fifteen $100 cash prizes.   ### Final Dispositions and Response Rates:  Table 1 below indicates the population and sample size (the number of surveys originally sent out to the randomly selected individuals), the number of actual responses, and the percentage of responses received by subpopulation. Population sizes were obtained from University Institutional Research and Reporting. A questionnaire was categorized as a respondent if at least three questions were answered.  Final dispositions for all cases were classified according to The American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR). 2016. Standard Definitions: Final Dispositions of Case Codes and Outcome Rates for Surveys. 9th edition. Table 2 itemizes final dispositions and the AAPOR Response Rate, RR2.  AAPOR Response Rate 2 is calculated using the following formula:  \\(RR2 = {(I+P) \\over (I+P) + (R+NC+O) + (UH+UO)}\\)  AAPOR Response Rate 2  12.8%   ## Weights:  Results were weighted to reflect the total counts of faculty, staff, undergraduate students, and graduate students at IUPUI in the fall of 2020 (shown in Table 1). This helps to correct for overrepresentation of some subpopulations (for example, staff) and underrepresentation of others (for example, students) among those who chose to respond to the survey by bringing their representation in line with the total counts in the overall IUPUI population. More specifically, the weights were defined as the number in the population divided by the number of respondents for each subpopulation (faculty, staff, etc.). For example, for faculty respondents, their weight was 4,664/167=27.9.  All estimates were weighted. Sampling error estimates account for weighting of the data.

As strategic sourcing and diversity manager, Lisa mostly works on multi-million-dollar, enterprise-wide Request for Proposals (RFPs), which often involve large stakeholder committees and/or committees made up of IU’s top administrators.  MS Teams gives her a centralized system to manage documents and emails related to RFP processes—an ideal way to manage those large committees with many busy individuals. She creates folders to organize documents and compile notes, feedback, and Q&A.  “My end game is to make the RFP process as simple as possible for committee members so they can find the files they need, and to streamline how I reach out to them,” Lisa said. “I can’t be sending 500 emails back and forth because it just lends itself to too much error.”  She values having one place to store the vendor information, presentation feedback, and other sensitive documents, and to be able to gather everyone’s input in one place. “It’s important to be able to document the audit trail, so people can find it when they need to.”  Build skills in storage and file sharing and check out UITS IT Training’s Teams offerings.

    "body": "  ## 2021 UITS User Survey IUE – Open Text Responses (Edited)  This text file includes responses to the following question of the UITS survey:  (At start of the survey): As you get started, please take a moment to share with us any thoughts, concerns, issues, and/or ideas that you may have. What positive experiences with UITS staff or services have you had? Are there concerns or negative interactions that you want us to know about? Do you have recommendations for new services or improvements to existing ones? (You will have a chance to review, amend, or add to your comments before submitting your responses.)  (At end of the survey): If you entered comments at the beginning of the survey, they are displayed below. If you would like to edit your comments, share recommendations for additional services and support resources, or add additional comments or suggestions please enter them below.  The responses are listed by respondent case number. Case numbers, in which the respondent did not leave any text, are not included.  Identifying references have been removed from this document and replaced with “[IRD]”. Responses are grouped by sample: Faculty, Staff, Undergraduate students, and Graduate students.   ### Faculty responses:  I need more free software.  I like the chat and email options as someone who has a hearing loss. Folks have always been helpful, ask clarifying questions when my initial concern isn't clear, and ensure I'm comfortable with the solution before letting things go.  I wish IT would do scheduled updates of classroom computers so they were ready for teaching. Chrome River should have mileage only as an option for the pre-approved form. That is all I am doing, and selecting other seems silly  IT hands faculty off to CFD for Canvas issues, and that could probably work better  Communicating with UITS staff is always positive in that staff are polite, respectful, and helpful. Sometimes there is a lack of information regarding technologies that interface with Canvas, such as LockDown Browser. Also, my university-owned computer is a Mac laptop. There is a very limited number of individuals who can assist me whenever I need software installed, for example. It can be time-consuming to wait for/locate a person with the correct admin password.  UITS staff have always proved very attentive to questions. I can expect a quick response, which is very much appreciated.  On the IUE campus, I have had very cooperative experiences with our IT staff. I have had need of a way to project handwritten math content on the projector, and they always supplied a document camera and provided help when I was unsure exactly how it interfaced with the computer. They have been prompt and very helpful.  I do not have any issues with the services--all encounters with UITS staff have also been positive. During the recent migration for Exchange, I lost all of my contacts, professional and personal, on my IPhone--apparently all were on the OWA? Since that point in time, I no longer check email on my phone :) My position with the campus does not require me to be available 24/7.  My experience with UITS has always been positive. Staff have always helped with any technology issues I and my students have experienced. Thank you to all who make our digital lives easier.  I have not understood how to use the replacement storage for Box. Messages were not clear, and I was unable to find where to store class presentations (PowerPoints etc).  UITS staff is great. But it is frustrating when platforms and other interfaces keep changing. It feels like we just get used to one particular interface and it is changed/migrated/retired/updated, etc. From a faculty perspective, we just want to use a tool as a means to an end, not spend hours every semester learning a new interface just to accomplish a task that we've been doing all along, if that makes sense. It also seems like really important actions are either not supported or stymied. For example, it would be SO helpful if Kaltura Mediaspace allowed me to do the kind of editing that iMovie allows like, for example, dropping a still into a video or adding text to a video, or splicing in a second video. That would make SUCH a difference to the quality of videos I make for students.  Our IUE UITS is just stellar!  I am most impressed with individuals who help me with IT questions over the phone or email: at our campus IT Helpdesk ([IRD]), CTL office ([IRD]) & classroom IT support ([IRD]); and through Bloomington--instructional development team ([IRD]) and ATAC office ([IRD]). They have helped me overcome all kinds of issues with Canvas and dictation and other issues in order to improve my teaching. [IRD] helped me create an extremely effective, impressive-looking Canvas site this summer for a writing class I will be teaching for years to come.  When it came to getting help especially on my local campus when I encountered disability issues recently and needed a dictation system to help, I found my campus much less helpful-- slow in responding and unable to find programs to help, even as I struggled to complete the semester. I just happened to stumble upon the Otter dictation system on my own just recently and am floored that IU would not know about this option when telling me that Dragon Dictation would not work on my Mac.  My other complaint is the amount of changes constantly happening to Canvas, Box, Textbook Orders, Chrome River, classroom clickers, DMAI, etc. It seems we just get used to one technological system and it changes! We do not have time to be learning new teaching platforms, migrating files out of Boxes, all because IU cannot stay focused on one system and improve it rather than jump into another. I speak for many faculty about this frustration with UITS.  I am satisfied with the service from UITS staffs.  Some issues I would like to see resolved:  Nice quick responses and help to questions  Nothing but positive interactions and help with people and IT help desk, on both my local campus (IUE) and 24/7 chat!  Please consider integrating Outlook and One Drive so that users who use Outlook on the web can save email attachment directly to One Drive as well as attach files from One Drive to the emails. Thanks!  None that come to mind.  In the past, I have sent UITS an email requesting assistance or updates to my work computer for various programs. Sometimes I do not receive a response, especially during the pandemic. In the future, I would like to receive a response, even if it just says that they cannot accommodate my request at this time.   ### Staff responses:  I have had relatively few interactions with UITS staff ; the few times I have had any issues, our IU East IT staff have been great at quickly helping fix any and all issues.  The UITS staff members at IU East treat me courteously and professionally.  The UITS team on the East campus is great! They're responsive, helpful, and almost always have a solution. If they don't, they will try to find someone from UITS who does. I have never had a negative interaction with UITS.  Service is good--usually quick and in a timely manner. My problems are usually user errors, so good luck with that.  IT at East is always prompt, courteous, and knowledgeable.  Nothing ever negative! They save my life with everyday technology struggles and go above and beyond to help!  I have had very positive experiences with [IRD], [IRD], [IRD], and [IRD] in the IU East office. Recently, [IRD] patiently assisted me with the Outlook migration on my phone, [IRD] went above and beyond to migrate the IU Library and Center for Service Learning files from Box, and [IRD] has made it possible for me to work remotely through COVID, updating the old laptop and even allowing me to deliver and pick up the device from the parking lot. Thank you!  The UITS team is amazing.  Remote connections are repeatedly disrupted when notifications pop on the screen. This makes efficiency and continuity difficult.  Skype for Business is continually delayed.  The staff at East are wonderful. [IRD] is great. [IRD] is fantastic when it comes to trouble shooting and getting us back up and running when something wonky happens with our computer. [IRD] are all great to work with.   ### Undergraduate responses:  I have had relatively good interactions and experiences with the UTIS service, and have only once utilized the UITS staff, one of which could not fix my problem; however, I believe that he did everything he knew how to do.  Um. I really didn't have any issues.  I feel like during this second semester my Fundamentals of Microsoft Instructor doesn't seem to care that I can't complete some of the tasks because I am using a MacBook instead of a Windows computer. Just some of the emails I got from him were a little unprofessional. The announcement he sent out in the beginning of the semester seemed to target MacBook users to say that people that had a MacBook necessary can't complete the assignments because they are using a MacBook.  I have had not had any issues with the UITS staff. I only needed them one time, and they were very helpful.  Helped me reset my password.  It has been helpful to me in the past. No complaints. Although, the mitigation testing for COVID has been extreme. I have had to go every week since the middle of winter break. Other than that, everything has been great!  I feel that UITS should be more involved with the special requirements for some courses.  Everything always works fine for me. No complaints here.  IT work well in my opinion. It could also be improved by fixing students/workers problems remotely using apps like teamviewer.  It is just a recommendation; they are pretty efficient.  That we need to make sure that all the application work the way they are supposed to.  N/A  I feel that all of my interactions with UITS staff and services have been positive.  I do not have any current concerns or issues.  Everything has been working perfectly for me, and I have not had any problems so far. Keep up the good work; overall I'm very satisfied.  I’ve only had positive experiences with UITS staff.  I have had to contact them previously, and it was a positive experience. It was a real individual, and they were knowledgeable. They were able to lead me to the needed conclusion. Kaltura can be a pain on some search engines.  I did not have any negative experiences with UITS. I actually have always been well received, and my problems have always been resolved quickly.  N/A  The UITS has always been helpful. I do not have any recommendations.  The majority of the software that IU has available goes unused. It's almost as if all of that software is deliberately hidden whether intentional or not. Even so, I have no use for this software because classes don't implement them, and when they do implement them, they are not implemented well.  The only technical issues I've ever had have been with the Duo verification. That's inconvenient, but not necessarily an error.  When I had a question, they were right there to answer my question and made sure I understood before hanging up.  The response from UITS is great...it's timely and accurate information that answers the questions I ask.  They helped me when I could not figure out how to post a video for one of my classes.  I have not had much interaction. They seem to be nice people, and I have no recommendations.  None   ### Graduate responses:  IT has always been there to support my tech needs. Issues are resolved quickly, and I am directed to other resources if needed.  I contacted the campus IT to help with transitioning my account to Outlook from Gmail, a requirement as a graduate student. My experience was pleasant, and the IT tech was considerate and helpful.  Because I utilize Google Drive for my documents and storage, I preferred my Gmail over the new Outlook format. I continue to use my Google Drive, and realize it's a different service not as compatible with Outlook—but miss the accessibility and usability of Google Drive and a Gmail account.  More than half of my emails force me to open in a separate browser. This is very inconvenient and I often have to use my laptop instead of mobile phone to read emails.  I also hate Duo login. It lags and does not always work. it is also very inconvenient.  I transferred in to Indiana University East from Ball State University ,and UITS staff was fantastic at getting my computer all set up and making sure all of my questions were answered! "

    "body": "  ## 2019 UITS User Survey Summary IUPUC   ### Brief guide to understanding the data  The UITS User Survey is administered by the Center for Survey Research. Surveys were sent to 376 randomly selected people at Indiana University-Purdue University Columbus (39 Faculty, 17 Staff, 302 Undergraduate students, 18 Graduate students). Please note that respondents who reported in the first question of the survey that they did not use UITS systems or services were not asked any additional questions and were removed from the results presented here.  The questions on the survey are primarily Likert opinion scales (1-5 rating scales with 5 being the most favorable rating). Responses to open-ended questions (for example, Question 9, see the survey questionnaire [INSERT LINK]) are not presented here. The results include:  For the average opinion and the satisfaction (helpfulness, importance, awareness, and agreement) scores , confidence intervals are provided. The confidence intervals indicate the sampling error for each estimate at the 95% confidence level. Average opinion and satisfaction (helpfulness, importance, awareness, and agreement) scores and their associated confidence intervals are not reported if they are based on fewer than 25 respondents. For categorical response questions that do not involve ratings such as whether the student lives in University housing or how often computing problems prevent accomplishing daily work, data are not reported for the full question if they are based on fewer than 25 respondents and data are not reported for a particular category if at least one (1) but fewer than five (5) respondents selected the category. Data that are not reported are indicated by “N/A”. “Not Applicable/Do Not Use” responses were removed prior to the calculation of estimates, except for usage rates. Missing data and “Unsure” responses were excluded from estimates as well.  This summary includes data from 60 people who participated in the survey (11 Faculty, 10 Staff, 36 Undergraduate students, 3 Graduate students). Results were weighted to reflect the total counts of those employed by the university (Faculty and Staff, combined) and students (Undergraduate and Graduate students, combined) at IUPUC in the fall of 2018. This helps to correct for overrepresentation of some subpopulations (for example, staff) and underrepresentation of others (for example, students) among those who chose to respond to the survey by bringing their representation in line with the total counts in the overall IUPUC population. Sampling error estimates account for weighting of the data.  It is important to note that some services are used only by certain subpopulations, so results are shown for the appropriate subpopulations. Subpopulations are indicated by FAC for faculty, STF for staff, GRD for graduate students, and UND for undergraduate students. In some cases, the scores are for groups of subpopulations, indicated for example by [GRD, UND] for services used by graduate and undergraduate students. Results are shown separately for multiple subpopulations where appropriate.   ### General Services  1. Overall, how important are UITS systems and services to your work or study?

    "body": "  ## 2019 IUB User Survey – Methods Summary  UITS at Indiana University contracts with the IU Center for Survey Research (CSR) each year to conduct an annual survey aimed at assessing current usage, awareness, and levels of satisfaction with UITS services.   ### Population and Sample:  The target population for the 2019 UITS User Survey is all current IUB faculty, staff, undergraduate, and graduate students. A random sample of 25% of each subpopulation was drawn from IU administrative databases. The university databases should be highly accurate and complete in providing coverage of the target population. The 2019 UITS User Survey was administered as a web survey and distributed via email invitation on January 29, 2019 to 12,199 randomly selected people at IU Bloomington (780 Faculty, 1,555 Staff, 7,909 Undergraduate students, 1,955 Graduate students).   ### Questionnaire and Data Collection:  The survey questions were developed by UITS. They ask about usage of email, devices, and services, as well as satisfaction with various tools and services available to the campus. The questions on the survey are primarily Likert opinion scales (1-5 rating scales with 5 always being the most favorable rating). Most questions include an “N/A” or “Do not use” response option. The survey was programmed in Qualtrics and thoroughly tested by CSR and UITS staff. The survey was administered in English only.  The field period for the 2019 UITS User Survey was January 29, 2019 through March 19, 2019. An invitation and five reminders were sent by email to maximize participation. As an incentive for participation, survey participants were entered into a drawing for one of eight $100 cash prizes.   ### Final Dispositions and Response Rates:  Table 1 below indicates the population and sample size (the number of surveys originally sent out to the randomly selected individuals), the number of actual responses, and the percentage of responses received by subpopulation. Population sizes were obtained from University Institutional Research and Reporting. A questionnaire was categorized as a respondent if at least three questions were answered.  Final dispositions for all cases were classified according to The American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR). 2016. Standard Definitions: Final Dispositions of Case Codes and Outcome Rates for Surveys. 9th edition. Table 2 itemizes final dispositions and the AAPOR Response Rate, RR2.  AAPOR Response Rate 2 is calculated using the following formula:  \\(RR2 = {(I+P) \\over (I+P) + (R+NC+O) + (UH+UO)}\\)  AAPOR Response Rate 2  12.4%   ## Weights:  Results were weighted to reflect the total counts of faculty, staff, undergraduate students, and graduate students at IUB in the fall of 2018 (shown in Table 1). This helps to correct for overrepresentation of some subpopulations (for example, staff) and underrepresentation of others (for example, students) among those who chose to respond to the survey by bringing their representation in line with the total counts in the overall IUB population. More specifically, the weights were defined as the number in the population divided by the number of respondents for each subpopulation (faculty, staff, etc.). For example, for faculty respondents, their weight was 3,080/182=16.9.  All estimates were weighted. Sampling error estimates account for weighting of the data.

During the coronavirus pandemic, when his exams for thousands of Kelley students were moved online, he received a Microsoft award for his innovative use of PowerShell to centralize the process of creating Teams sites for hundreds of Kelley students.  “Many of my students are freshmen, and throughout their entire high school career, it was all Google Docs, Google Docs, Google Docs,” says Brant. “I'm trying to convince them that was fine for high school, but now with Teams you have a more integrated way of sharing files, and everyone has instant access to edit that document right away, without having to collect email addresses.”  Brant also uses Teams to make life a bit easier for his students—and himself. For a weekly online lecture, he noticed some students not able to attend. “But if you missed it, you missed points for participation during that exam or during that class session,” Brant explains. “So I used Power Automate to create a Microsoft form that I would send out to students who missed class. They would select what class they missed and based on what they chose, Power Automate would then send them a link to that class.”  Build skills in Power Automate and PowerShell , and check out UITS IT Training’s Teams offerings.

    "body": "  ## 2021 UITS User Survey Summary IU Southeast (IUS)   ### Brief guide to understanding the data  The UITS User Survey is administered by the Center for Survey Research. Surveys were sent to 1,179 randomly selected people at Indiana University Southeast (98 Faculty, 48 Staff, 910 Undergraduate students, 123 Graduate students). Please note that respondents who reported that they did not use UITS systems or services (see Question 1) were not asked any additional questions and were removed from the results presented here.  The questions on the survey are primarily Likert opinion scales (1-5 rating scales with 5 being the most favorable rating). Responses to open-ended questions are not presented here. The results include:  For the average opinion and the satisfaction/importance/agreement scores, confidence intervals are provided. The confidence intervals indicate the sampling error for each estimate at the 95% confidence level. Average opinion and satisfaction/importance/agreement scores and their associated confidence intervals are not reported if they are based on fewer than 25 respondents. For categorical response questions that do not involve ratings such as whether the student lives in University housing or preferred method(s) of communications from UITS, data are not reported for the full question if they are based on fewer than 25 respondents and data are not reported for a particular category if at least one (1) but fewer than five (5) respondents selected the category. Data that are not reported are indicated by “N/A”. “Not Applicable/Do Not Use” responses were removed prior to the calculation of estimates, except for usage rates. Missing data were excluded from estimates as well.  This summary includes data from 107 people who participated in the survey (22 Faculty, 22 Staff, 56 Undergraduate students, 7 Graduate students). Results were weighted to reflect the total counts of faculty, staff, and students (Undergraduate and Graduate students, combined) at IUS in the fall of 2020. This helps to correct for overrepresentation of some subpopulations (for example, staff) and underrepresentation of others (for example, students) among those who chose to respond to the survey by bringing their representation in line with the total counts in the overall IUS population. Sampling error estimates account for weighting of the data.  It is important to note that some services are only used by specific subpopulations, so questions were only asked to those groups. Subpopulations of users are indicated by FAC for faculty, STF for staff, GRD for graduate students, and UND for undergraduate students.   ### General Services  1.

    "body": "  ## 2019 UITS User Survey Summary IU Southeast (IUS)   ### Brief guide to understanding the data  The UITS User Survey is administered by the Center for Survey Research. Surveys were sent to 1,359 randomly selected people at Indiana University Southeast (122 Faculty, 90 Staff, 1,025 Undergraduate students, 122 Graduate students). Please note that respondents who reported in the first question of the survey that they did not use UITS systems or services were not asked any additional questions and were removed from the results presented here  The questions on the survey are primarily Likert opinion scales (1-5 rating scales with 5 being the most favorable rating). Responses to open-ended questions (for example, Question 9, see the survey questionnaire [INSERT LINK]) are not presented here. The results include:  For the average opinion and the satisfaction (helpfulness, importance, awareness, and agreement) scores , confidence intervals are provided. The confidence intervals indicate the sampling error for each estimate at the 95% confidence level. Average opinion and satisfaction (helpfulness, importance, awareness, and agreement) scores and their associated confidence intervals are not reported if they are based on fewer than 25 respondents. For categorical response questions that do not involve ratings such as whether the student lives in University housing or how often computing problems prevent accomplishing daily work, data are not reported for the full question if they are based on fewer than 25 respondents and data are not reported for a particular category if at least one (1) but fewer than five (5) respondents selected the category. Data that are not reported are indicated by “N/A”. “Not Applicable/Do Not Use” responses were removed prior to the calculation of estimates, except for usage rates. Missing data and “Unsure” responses were excluded from estimates as well.  This summary includes data from 194 people who participated in the survey (29 Faculty, 34 Staff, 117 Undergraduate students, 14 Graduate students). Results were weighted to reflect the total counts of faculty, staff, and students (Undergraduate and Graduate students, combined) at IUS in the fall of 2018. This helps to correct for overrepresentation of some subpopulations (for example, staff) and underrepresentation of others (for example, students) among those who chose to respond to the survey by bringing their representation in line with the total counts in the overall IUS population. Sampling error estimates account for weighting of the data.  It is important to note that some services are used only by certain subpopulations, so results are shown for the appropriate subpopulations. Subpopulations are indicated by FAC for faculty, STF for staff, GRD for graduate students, and UND for undergraduate students. In some cases, the scores are for groups of subpopulations, indicated for example by [GRD, UND] for services used by graduate and undergraduate students. Results are shown separately for multiple subpopulations where appropriate.  For detail on the study methodology, please see [INSERT LINK].   ### General Services  1.

    "body": "  ## 2021 UITS User Survey IUSB – Open Text Responses (Edited)  This text file includes responses to the following question of the UITS survey:  (At start of the survey): As you get started, please take a moment to share with us any thoughts, concerns, issues, and/or ideas that you may have. What positive experiences with UITS staff or services have you had? Are there concerns or negative interactions that you want us to know about? Do you have recommendations for new services or improvements to existing ones? (You will have a chance to review, amend, or add to your comments before submitting your responses.)  (At end of the survey): If you entered comments at the beginning of the survey, they are displayed below. If you would like to edit your comments, share recommendations for additional services and support resources, or add additional comments or suggestions please enter them below.  The responses are listed by respondent case number. Case numbers, in which the respondent did not leave any text, are not included.  Identifying references have been removed from this document and replaced with “[IRD]”. Responses are grouped by sample: Faculty, Staff, Undergraduate students, and Graduate students.   ### Faculty responses:  I have only positive experiences with IT as a whole. I do think we need to be more systematic in providing tech support to students, and reminding them that tech support is available 24/7. About 1/3 of the questions I get when teaching online are tech related. It really divides my focus away from teaching and content.  Since the survey mentioned fax, I did find it surprising and a bit of an inconvenience to find that fax is still required for some things. Seems like a couple decades since that's been a relevant technology, and having to figure out how to fax something in the middle of COVID was not ideal.  My interactions with all the IT staff are positive. They deal well with people like me who are experiencing frustrations when technology is difficult for me to use.  Most experiences have been positive - helpful feedback from staff when trying to resolve issues and concerns. Challenging to explain specifics over the phone and wish there was a way to meet in person  - but completely understand the current restrictions due to the pandemic.  Impressions of UITS staff and services has been overwhelmingly positive. However, the pandemic has made it more difficult to get immediate help, which has been frustrating as there have been new technologies in place during the pandemic. But overall, UITS earns high marks from me.  UITS at IUSB is always very helpful when I go to them with issues. Definitely no complaints there.  The phishing \"gotcha\" emails continue to be useless, as they don't really help you learn from your mistakes. (I initially thought the email for this survey was a phishing scam, since the email was not from an iu.edu but an indiana.edu address, which is what a lot of the gotcha emails come from. I didn't report it, because that would mean doing some digging to remind myself what to do.)  Otherwise, not much to comment on.  All I have is praise for the UITS staff; they are always available to help when issues arise. They are committed to their work, and I highly appreciate this. I use Zoom and document camera to teach, and I have received tremendous help when needed.  Staff is wonderfully friendly and helpful! I especially appreciate [IRD] who is always so patient as well as being super knowledgeable.  I had a positive experience in my recent workshop with UITS staff and services.  My general experience with UITS has been positive.  [IRD]and [IRD] at the South Bend campus have been fantastic in helping us navigate the process of creating secure institutional storage in Teams!  IT security, support, and guidance are extremely helpful, but not everyone uses them as much as they should. IT systems are incredibly important for the routine work that we all do, and I am a bit concerned that our work has become fragmented as IT systems multiply (eg. Microsoft 365 and Google). I wonder if we are reaching a point where something like \"IT leadership\" might be helpful--that is, acknowledging the centrality of IT systems for our shared work as well as the need to bring people together to create a solid infrastructure that facilitates collaboration. IT systems will always need to be diverse and customized for various needs, of course, but it would be very helpful if University leadership (not just IT) could emphasize the importance of a core, integrated set of tools for everyone.  At this time I am happy with the services and staff. The cameras in the classrooms for Zoom are sometimes a wide enough angel and sometimes very narrow such that they don't allow movement of the instructor.  Not at this time.   ### Staff responses:  Everyone that I have worked with in IT have been very patient and helpful.  I do think the email communication when you communicate for an incident is very antiquated.  There is one minor annoyance I've been having with technology at IU in my day-to-day work. I realize it's a security issue and is likely not going to change, but I have a platform here so I figure I'd bring it up anyway. I am a Mac user, so I'm not sure how my experience compares to the majority of IU employees who use Windows, but updates of basic software already included on the machine such as Firefox or Microsoft Office are incredibly annoying and tedious.  Whenever an application has an update, which is frequently, I have to call the Help Desk, hope that the person who is able to use Macs isn't busy, and then have them remote into my machine to approve the update. It gets old pretty quickly, and I'm to the point where I let software stay outdated for a long time so I don't feel like I'm constantly having to call the Help Desk. If there is the capability to have certain UITS approved software allowed to be automatically updated without direct intervention of an admin, that would be hugely appreciated.  My account was hacked in the beginning of the semester, and it took close to two weeks of repeatedly being signed out to fix it. Since I had taken on a new role just then, this was most problematic.  My entire sent folder was deleted in early December, and I was told there was no way to restore it unless I went to the \"system deleted items folder\" and recovered 100 emails at a time. Given that I have been here 12 years+ this has been a pain. Recovery of the items was not simple as all recovered items go into the inbox only and messed up both my inbox as well as my sent items folder. I cannot believe that there is no EASY restore option in IT given all the cloud resources we have been adding. All this took many days of back and forth.  [IRD] is the bestest ever!!!! He is very patient and helpful with my Chromebook.  All of my interactions with UITS staff have been pleasant. They have always been courteous and professional and always have successfully helped me resolve the issue at hand.  We need a better computer to punch in/out for work.  The IT Staff have been a tremendous help whenever I have needed any type of guidance regarding either Computer help and also Cell phone assistance. GREAT TEAM!!  Interactions are always positive.  I am a \"run of the mill\" user of technology. I learn what I have to learn to do my job, and I need lots of technology support. I am older and not interested in the \"bells and whistles\" of most of the technology I have to deal with. I would like to point out that several questions in this survey are skewed toward those who speak fluent \"technology.\" I may use some of the technology you asked about but not know its actual name! Yes, there are people like me out there!  I did the best I could with the survey.  I have always received exceptional service and assistance from our UITS staff. I can't thank them enough for all they do for IU.  The staff is kind and knowledgeable when I call, but some of our international students have had trouble with being understood over the phone. When this happens, I try to phone in and try to resolve any miscommunications. It would go a long way for staff to show more empathy and patience toward these students and understanding that ESL learners are not usually confident in their ability to speak in technical English terms. I'd suggest speaking slower for these students and/or asking the student to speak slower if the staff member has trouble with understanding an accent/dialect.  I love the UITS staff at IUSB. They are so helpful.  Students should be able to use the IU Fax service.  On the South Bend Campus, the help desk has gone above and beyond this last year. When preparing to move us off campus because of the pandemic, the staff worked tirelessly to ensure that our needs were met and that we could conduct business at home.  I interact with the local UITS staff on a regular basis. Most recently, when updating Exchange access. They are very knowledgable and helpful.  I really struggle with assistance with my Mac. I don’t have the sense that there are folks (on my campus at least) who can really help. The desktop Mac in my office is only about a year old and has run very slowly since the day I got it. Some UITS folks have definitely tried to help me figure it out, but they have never been able to identify any problems, which just leaves me feeling stuck. Especially since the pandemic, I generally just bring my laptop to campus when I need to be in my office. Otherwise my day gets hung up in making my computer work.  Separately, I don't always know who I need to be talking to among our campus UITS staff. The organizational structure is murky, and our help desk is pretty spotty in actually being helpful. There are a few UITS staff members who I know can usually help me out, so I do sometimes reach out to them directly. There are several problems there, that I can see. First, it’s terrible for any UITS processes because there isn’t a ticket most of the time. Second, I’m not totally clear on what any of their primary jobs are, so I am almost certainly asking them to help me with things that don’t fall into their normal duties, which isn’t great. Last, I wouldn’t do this if it didn’t sometimes feel like the most efficient way to address a need. For very small things, calling the help desk is fine, but many things take a lot of time and/or don’t get resolved through that path.  Satisfied  They are very knowledgeable on topics; however, their communication needs improvement. I am a staff who does not call unless I have exhausted all options, but I feel like a burden sometimes when I do need help. If I call with a fairly simple issue, their tone and response make me feel like I am unintelligent. In addition to the communication, I often have to state that I have already reviewed the KB already and followed the steps they are reading through.  UITS staff is great to work with. A bit concerned about timing of major changes and upgrades.  I had positive experience with UITS staff, both at help desk and individuals within a specific department. However, I have had a very negative experience for printing on campus. Some of the printers were out of paper, and the network printer didn't work. My print jobs showed up at the printer, but after I slid my card, it didn't print. I repeated the process three to four times, trying different printers, and spending more than half an hour, and still was unable to print on campus.   ### Undergraduate responses:  I have not had any negative interactions with UITS staff or services.  I've had only good experiences so far this year. Every time I have had a question and emailed someone, they have responded back in a timely manner.  I have not experienced much interaction with the UITS staff except once, and the interaction was very pleasant. The person assisting me was very genuine and helpful. I don't have any suggestions on what to do differently.  I have not personally interacted with staff but have seen that there is plenty of information and resources available to help students should they need it, so thank you for making that available.  I thought the emails were a great way to communicate changes and suggestions. It was helpful to always be alerted and prepared for changes. The in-person help was also extremely patient and helpful.  The student center has a very outdated layout and needs an update. It can also be a little tricky to find things like my AAR due to the poor layout.  The staff is very helpful with any questions students might have.  I think the fact that most exams need to be taken with LockDown should be amended somewhat, as LockDown is not compatible with all platforms and is thus a bit of an inconvenience.  The two step verification system is often an issue for me since I need to have connection on my phone. If I don’t have a signal, I can’t log on to my account on the computer. Other than that, I am satisfied with how things run.  For me working and going to school, taking time to get tutoring can be challenging due to my work hours. However, I have Friday off. And when there are tutoring hours during that day, it has helped me get the tutoring I need. The tutor was very patient with me. And he was able to assist through the Zoom session. It would be great to see that there is more availability for tutoring for students that are not able to attend during school hours. Now with the pandemic, it is great to know that the ability to communicate with our professors through Zoom is there.  I currently have no serious concerns with the UITS staff. They have all been helpful and have answered my questions promptly and in a courteous manner.  I do wish that UITS, if they haven't already done so, could create a quick tips or refresher guide for instructors. I feel like some aren't using the sites such as Canvas to its full extent.  No.  I have had positive experiences with UITS.  Make the mobile/phone Canvas app more accessible for people doing school work on the go.  Transitions to third party sites aren’t as smooth and sometimes drop or fail.  I think the set up for the \"Student Center\" could be more user friendly. When I have to sign up for classes, I have to go back to an email I got at the beginning of starting classes at IU in order to figure out where to go and how to do it.  I have not had any issues with UITS. However, I have only used Zoom, which, so far, has worked very well.  The library services are very important to me.  There is nothing I can think of.  Everything has been working fine for me.  When professor had technology issue during the class, the IT staffs always responded fast and solved the issue quickly, which I think is pretty supportive.  The only experience I remember with UITS when my cell phone broke and I did not know how to get through Duo without it. However, I had already solved the issue when they responded back.  I utilized UITS for helping me access the Lockdown browser for exams when everything went online at the beginning of the pandemic  No, I have no problems with UITS service.  I do not like fully online learning, I am not fully satisfied with Zoom.  They helped me when I was having issues with Exemplify.  Positive experience I’ve had was getting help setting up my laptop.  I never have an issue. They are willing to help anytime I have a question or when i don’t know how to do things.  They have done a great job every time I have called. My questions are always answered and are correct.  They were great and easy to work with!  I would like to state that the systems in place are not necessarily problematic. However, often in my studies, I have had professors who do not know how to use these systems we have in place. More times than not, I have had a professor state that resources are in the files tab on Canvas, and they have not added a files tab to their Canvas page. I feel that if Indiana University wants to push online or hybrid-based courses, it is IU's responsibility to teach their facility on how to use the platforms we are expected to learn on.  I had a couple IT problems during my first semester at IU and the IT staff were happy to help with any problem I had.  N/a   ### Graduate responses:  When in campus buildings the Wi-Fi is touchy during classes. I recommend upgrading this system or providing more networks so students are able to connect to via WIFI.  I have the opportunity to work with UITS staff this past fall when my Canvas was not working. The gentleman was [IRD]. He was very professional, kind, and successful in helping me. I felt like he took the responsibility to heart and was definitely the best person to work with.  I contacted UITS when I was having trouble accessing my email. They responded quickly and were in contact with me back and forth until the problem was resolved. I have not had a problem since.  N/A  I couldn’t get WIFI to work at all my first time on campus  I have had no issues with UITS services and have been able to do my work both on campus and remotely.  None.  I've called the help desk a few times, and the person I spoke to was brusque and seemed annoyed by my question. When I went in-person for help, I received much better service. It's been awhile now, so I can't fully remember if this already exists, but a new student guide would be helpful (we get so many individual emails when we start that maybe a permanent page on the website that is searchable would be better than an email).  With being a new IUSB student and getting my masters, I found it was most helpful to have a sit down time with UITS staff when learning how to navigate one.iu, including how to register for classes, etc. Otherwise, I wouldn't have known what to do. Otherwise, setting my one.iu account wasn't easy. It was difficult to get my student ID number to create it, and I felt like I was sent back and forth from IT, student services, and the nursing department. It wasn't until I was given my ID number by an IT member in person during orientation that I was able to set up my one.iu account with their help.  I have had difficulty using my laptop when on campus. For some reason, even with fellow students' help, we can't seem to use the internet when on campus using my laptop (Apple). "

    "body": "  ## 2021 UITS User Survey IUPUC – Open Text Responses (Edited)  This text file includes responses to the following question of the UITS survey:  (At start of the survey): As you get started, please take a moment to share with us any thoughts, concerns, issues, and/or ideas that you may have. What positive experiences with UITS staff or services have you had? Are there concerns or negative interactions that you want us to know about? Do you have recommendations for new services or improvements to existing ones? (You will have a chance to review, amend, or add to your comments before submitting your responses.)  (At end of the survey): If you entered comments at the beginning of the survey, they are displayed below. If you would like to edit your comments, share recommendations for additional services and support resources, or add additional comments or suggestions please enter them below.  The responses are listed by respondent case number. Case numbers, in which the respondent did not leave any text, are not included.  Identifying references have been removed from this document and replaced with “[IRD]”. Responses are grouped by sample: Faculty, Staff, Undergraduate students, and Graduate students.   ### Faculty responses:  They do a good job. The Columbus on-call person is great.  UITS staff and services have always promptly replied to my questions and concerns, especially when I may be dealing with an issue related to my desktop computer in my office or a question regarding a computer while giving a proctored test in the CLC. Thank you.  The person-to-person interaction is wonderful; however, the phone interaction is not as wonderful.  Any time I have needed support from UITS, the staff at IUPUC has been readily available. The staff is quick to solve any issues I experience in the classroom or office.  They were very helpful.  My local (IUPUC) team is fantastic. They can't always fix my problems or answer my questions (sometimes due to limitations of funding), but they try hard. They know the people on our campus. I like the adaptation to having an open Zoom meeting for help during COVID (business hours).  Routing is a problem. Calling Bloomington for an IUPUC problem is typically useless. Calling Bloomington for software help is ok - I have to be routed to an expert which can take awhile and sometimes doesn't happen (my example is Kaltura. One time I got to Zoom with an IU expert and I learned all sorts of helpful stuff).  None at this time  My experience has been quite positive- I have found staff to be responsive in a timely fashion and friendly when helping me. Tech specifics are not my strong point, and what may be simple for others is challenging for me, yet I never feel stupid asking for assistance. The staff also provide recommendations.  I do like the new tech, such as the OWLS; I appreciate the efforts to help improve what tech I have available.  I appreciate the phishing education and emails sent as I have learned (by error in clicking) more ways than I ever imagined how phishing efforts may present.  I have a concern: I have had trouble reaching some faculty via email this semester. The faculty have been in the nursing department. They appear to have multiple emails, and I believe they do not check all their emails. I advise you try to teach people that they can have a secondary or supplemental email box forward messages to their primary email address.  I went so far as to look up the [IRD] email in nursing so I could try to reach these people, and when I copied and pasted the email from the website for [IRD], I received a failed email message. If people have more than one IU email, please help them understand that they can make all the emails go to one box. I have three IU emails, and they all deliver to the same Box.  Please educate people about how to manage multiple email addresses--especially during remote working conditions, email availability is really important.   ### Staff responses:  Our UITS department at IUPUC is awesome. They are very knowledgeable and friendly and are always prompt when resolving issues.  I have had nothing but pleasant experiences working with IUPUC's UITS staff. They are wonderful people who not only know what they are doing, but like to help others, and that shows in their work.  My interactions with the UITS staff at IUPUC has always been positive. They are quick to respond, professional, and always work to find the best and fastest solutions to problems. They quickly adapted to the virtual environment and provide great service to staff working remotely.  Best and most helpful experiences are live (either phone, video or in person) conversations with a staff person ***from our campus.*** In that arena, issues are addressed and resolved quickly and easily.  Less positive is trying to work with UITS staff working at other campuses who are not familiar with local resources or rooms, or working with any UITS staff only through \"ticket\" email exchange. I would like to see an immediate offer for a phone call, video chat, or office visit in addition to self-guided instructions (i.e. IUKB article links) on every ticket. Communication about upcoming UITS initiatives and changes is improving somewhat. Exactly how those changes will impact end-users would also be helpful.  Post survey addition: I had never heard of some of the tools and platforms rated in the survey (i.e. Security Center, Pages)/had no idea they existed.  Our local UITS staff is wonderful. Had a recent problem with the Exchange Migration. There was no warning. Tried to follow directions on KB about how to restart Exchange on my devices. There was outdated information on those directions. Also, I didn't know my Exchange had been migrated. No warning or advance information about what to do. Local IT people helped me out. When I called the main help number, I could not get through, which the recording said was because of the high volume of calls due to the Exchange migration. Big time fail on UITS's part, especially during a pandemic when so many people are working from home.  IUPUC UITS staff are always very responsive when I contact with questions or help needs.  The Remote Desktop function is a constant headache. Since we have to work away from the office now (and have for several months), I’m surprised the interface is not i) more reliable, and ii) easier to use.  The process I have to follow to store, retrieve, use, edit, re-store, and manage documents is clunky, and the systems changes over the last couple of years have made them even clunkier to use.   ### Undergraduate responses:  I have had some issues with technology not working within the classroom. We have had to leave the classroom to go get a tech from the other building at IUPUC, and I think something that might be beneficial is an app that we could use to request a tech to a certain room.  I have had a great experience with UITS staff. They have been very helpful, friendly and knowledgeable.  I've only heard of positive experiences.  No positive or negative experiences at this time.  Nothing, I think everything updated works well.  Overall easiness of getting past vaccines and lying about them via email.  UITS staff has always seemed friendly whenever I had a question or issue. They are also pretty quick when resolving issues that I have seen within the classroom.  I do not have any concerns about UITS. I was able to utilize this service over the summer of 2020 and effectively resolved my technological issue with the help of UTIS staff.  I have only had positive interactions with the UITS staff so far. I do wish the internet connection stretched further across campus. With COVID, it would be especially nice to have internet outside.  I don't have any memorable interactions with UTIS staff.  N/A  I have had many positive experiences with UITS staff and/or services, which has made using technology on the IUPUC Campus run smoothly. They are always diligently on time and work well with any issues I have had.  I am very thankful for patience from UITS staff as I am an older student and not as efficient with understanding how to navigate my laptop. They are always helpful and respond quickly to my needs.   ### Graduate responses:  My interactions with UITS have been entirely satisfactory. I have been impressed with their responsiveness and ability to resolve issues. "

A random sample of 25% of each subpopulation was drawn from IU administrative databases. The university databases should be highly accurate and complete in providing coverage of the target population. The 2019 UITS User Survey was administered as a web survey and distributed via email invitation on January 29, 2019 to 1,359 randomly selected people at IU Southeast (122 Faculty, 90 Staff, 1,025 Undergraduate students, 122 Graduate students).   ### Questionnaire and Data Collection:  The survey questions were developed by UITS. They ask about usage of email, devices, and services, as well as satisfaction with various tools and services available to the campus. The questions on the survey are primarily Likert opinion scales (1-5 rating scales with 5 always being the most favorable rating). Most questions include an “N/A” or “Do not use” response option. The survey was programmed in Qualtrics and thoroughly tested by CSR and UITS staff. The survey was administered in English only.  The field period for the 2019 UITS User Survey was January 29, 2019 through March 19, 2019. An invitation and five reminders were sent by email. An invitation letter was also mailed via USPS to all sample members with complete mailing addresses to maximize participation. As an incentive for participation, survey participants were entered into a drawing for a $100 cash prize.   ### Final Dispositions and Response Rates:  Table 1 below indicates the population and sample size (the number of surveys originally sent out to the randomly selected individuals), the number of actual responses, and the percentage of responses received by subpopulation. Population sizes were obtained from University Institutional Research and Reporting. A questionnaire was categorized as a respondent if at least three questions were answered.  Final dispositions for all cases were classified according to The American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR). 2016. Standard Definitions: Final Dispositions of Case Codes and Outcome Rates for Surveys. 9th edition. Table 2 itemizes final dispositions and the AAPOR Response Rate, RR2.  AAPOR Response Rate 2 is calculated using the following formula:  \\(RR2 = {(I+P) \\over (I+P) + (R+NC+O) + (UH+UO)}\\)  AAPOR Response Rate 2  14.4%   ## Weights:  Results were weighted to reflect the total counts of faculty, staff, and students (Undergraduate and Graduate students, combined) at IUS in the fall of 2018 (shown in Table 1). Since there were fewer than 20 respondents in the graduate student subpopulation, graduate and undergraduate students were combined for weighting purposes. This helps to correct for overrepresentation of some subpopulations (for example, staff) and underrepresentation of others (for example, students) among those who chose to respond to the survey by bringing their representation in line with the total counts in the overall IUS population. More specifically, the weights were defined as the number in the population divided by the number of respondents for each subpopulation (faculty, staff, and students). For example, for faculty respondents, their weight was 427/29=14.7.  All estimates presented in the summary of results and in Tableau have been weighted. Sampling error estimates account for weighting of the data.  For additional information or questions about administration of the survey, please contact csr@indiana.edu . "

    "body": "  ## 2021 UITS User Survey Summary IU South Bend (IUSB)   ### Brief guide to understanding the data  The UITS User Survey is administered by the Center for Survey Research. Surveys were sent to 1.037 randomly selected people at Indiana University South Bend (105 Faculty, 62 Staff, 761 Undergraduate students, 109 Graduate students). Please note that respondents who reported that they did not use UITS systems or services (see Question 1) were not asked any additional questions and were removed from the results presented here.  The questions on the survey are primarily Likert opinion scales (1-5 rating scales with 5 being the most favorable rating). Responses to open-ended questions are not presented here. The results include:  For the average opinion and the satisfaction/importance/agreement scores, confidence intervals are provided. The confidence intervals indicate the sampling error for each estimate at the 95% confidence level. Average opinion and satisfaction/importance/agreement scores and their associated confidence intervals are not reported if they are based on fewer than 25 respondents. For categorical response questions that do not involve ratings such as whether the student lives in University housing or preferred method(s) of communications from UITS, data are not reported for the full question if they are based on fewer than 25 respondents and data are not reported for a particular category if at least one (1) but fewer than five (5) respondents selected the category. Data that are not reported are indicated by “N/A”. “Not Applicable/Do Not Use” responses were removed prior to the calculation of estimates, except for usage rates. Missing data were excluded from estimates as well.  This summary includes data from 122 people who participated in the survey (24 Faculty, 23 Staff, 58 Undergraduate students, 17 Graduate students). Results were weighted to reflect the total counts of faculty, staff, and students (Undergraduate and Graduate students, combined) at IUSB in the fall of 2020. This helps to correct for overrepresentation of some subpopulations (for example, staff) and underrepresentation of others (for example, students) among those who chose to respond to the survey by bringing their representation in line with the total counts in the overall IUSB population. Sampling error estimates account for weighting of the data.  It is important to note that some services are only used by specific subpopulations, so questions were only asked to those groups. Subpopulations of users are indicated by FAC for faculty, STF for staff, GRD for graduate students, and UND for undergraduate students.   ### General Services  1.

    "body": "  ## 2021 UITS User Survey Summary IU Bloomington (IUB)   ### Brief guide to understanding the data  The UITS User Survey is administered by the Center for Survey Research. Surveys were sent to 16,298 randomly selected people at Indiana University Bloomington (1,248 Faculty, 1,492 Staff, 9,860 Undergraduate students, 3,698 Graduate students). Please note that respondents who reported that they did not use UITS systems or services (see Question 1) were not asked any additional questions and were removed from the results presented here.  The questions on the survey are primarily Likert opinion scales (1-5 rating scales with 5 being the most favorable rating). Responses to open-ended questions are not presented here. The results include:  For the average opinion and the satisfaction/importance/agreement scores, confidence intervals are provided. The confidence intervals indicate the sampling error for each estimate at the 95% confidence level. Average opinion and satisfaction/importance/agreement scores and their associated confidence intervals are not reported if they are based on fewer than 25 respondents. For categorical response questions that do not involve ratings such as whether the student lives in University housing or preferred method(s) of communications from UITS, data are not reported for the full question if they are based on fewer than 25 respondents and data are not reported for a particular category if at least one (1) but fewer than five (5) respondents selected the category. Data that are not reported are indicated by “N/A”. “Not Applicable/Do Not Use” responses were removed prior to the calculation of estimates, except for usage rates. Missing data were excluded from estimates as well.  This summary includes data from 1,804 people who participated in the survey (250 Faculty, 481 Staff, 540 Undergraduate students, 533 Graduate students). Results were weighted to reflect the total counts of faculty, staff, undergraduate students, and graduate students at IUB in the fall of 2020. This helps to correct for overrepresentation of some subpopulations (for example, staff) and underrepresentation of others (for example, students) among those who chose to respond to the survey by bringing their representation in line with the total counts in the overall IUB population. Sampling error estimates account for weighting of the data.  It is important to note that some services are only used by specific subpopulations, so questions were only asked to those groups. Subpopulations of users are indicated by FAC for faculty, STF for staff, GRD for graduate students, and UND for undergraduate students. There were also questions only asked to students living on campus and those have been noted appropriately. Additionally, there were questions specific to campus subpopulations. These are indicated by IUB for the Indiana University Bloomington campus and IUPUI for the Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis campus.   ### General Services  1.

    "body": "  ## 2019 UITS User Survey IUPUI  – Open Text Responses (Edited)  This text file includes responses to the following question of the UITS survey:  (At start of the survey): As you get started, please take a moment to share with us any thoughts, concerns, issues, and/or ideas that you may have. What positive experiences with UITS staff or services have you had? Are there concerns or negative interactions that you want us to know about? Do you have recommendations for new services or improvements to existing ones? (You will have a chance to review, amend, or add to your comments before submitting your responses.)  (At end of the survey): If you entered comments at the beginning of the survey, they are displayed below. If you would like to edit your comments, share recommendations for additional services and support resources, or add additional comments or suggestions please enter them below.  Identifying references have been removed from this document and replaced with “[IRD]”. Responses are grouped by sample: Faculty, Staff, Undergraduate students, and Graduate students.   ### Faculty responses:  I have had overall good help. However, sometimes things get rolled out and they haven't been tested correctly. An example is the Pulse debacle. It caused all sorts of issues for both PC and Macs and when IT contacted, there was no good answer. Finally a work around was found, but it took weeks.  I really haven't had any interactions.  Nothing stands out. I do find it annoying to have to request CAITS help for simple things like updating certain programs just because I don't have admin access. But otherwise, I don't really think about UITS.  -           Having an orientation about IT policies during the new employee orientation will be helpful. As a new hire at IU, I didn't know several IT policies until the policies started affecting my work negatively. If I have known such policies in advance, I could have resolved sooner. Now, all issues that I had have been resolved thanks to the help from UITS.  -           Giving administrative privilege for a limited time (e.g. 30 min) will decrease the workload of IT team and make it easy for the end-users. At my previous institutions, once I enter the last 4 digits of my social security numbers to the computer assigned to me, I was able to install key scientific software while IT team can audit what I'm doing. It is time-consuming to keep calling IT team whenever I have new updates to install for the programs that were already installed by the IT team.  UITS staff have always been helpful and friendly.  I appreciate that a UITS staff person comes to the student orientation I organize each August even though I oversee a relatively small program.  I enjoy working the CAITS folks as they best seem to understand my needs; they are polite and positive in their responses.  When there are enough people available, wait times are short and service is excellent. But that is WHEN people are available. I had an incident occur with what turned out to be an equipment failure on the first day of class, and while someone was there to answer the phones and help as much as they could, they only had 2 people in the field and no one to help me in time to avoid losing most of my class time that day.  I am happy with the UITS services  Service has been good.  I always have positive experiences with IU help - the phone system where you call a consultant for assistance with computer and electronic communication issues. This has been a great service.  I have had very positive impressions on the staff and services from UITS.  I have few interactions with UITS staff. The walk up window people are friendly.  One problem that I would like to have resolved is the very frequent problem with Outlook on my office desktop that indicates a lost connection and therefore not updating incoming email until I click the Connect button at the bottom of the screen.  The IT chat seems to be the best way to get quick responses. They are usually able to troubleshoot any problems. I do have concerns about the equipment. I teach in IT 265 and the sound on the computer has never worked, even after reporting the problem. I also teach in Eskenazi Hall 191 and 194 and the projectors seem to be aligned.  About 50% of the time I call or a student calls the help desk for real time assistance, the technicians are not able to offer sufficient help or troubleshoot the issues effectively. More time and resources should be dedicated to ensuring that the front line technicians have sufficient knowledge and skills to assist with issues that students, staff, and faculty face.  In general, I have been happy at how quickly I am able to get in contact with someone when I call.  Service and response are very slow. Not at digital age. Reminds me of dial up internet speed!! The survey is too long and not targeted.  Positives: network speed and Wi-Fi coverage have improved.  Negatives: proliferation of platforms and software for video-conferencing is confusing and could be streamlined. Lync phones are difficult to use and all seem to have LCD screen problems.  Desires: Increased software availability through IUware; more seamless access to backed-up storage space on the UITS network.  First, Gary Curto has been very helpful in trying to resolve the problems that I have had. He was prompt, respectful, and concerned. However, he knew the limits, yet offered reasonable alternatives to the challenges I was experiencing. Thank you, Gary.  Second, I have been issued a computer that does NOT have a VGA \"plug\" in it. Apparently, the university doesn't offer a computer with VGA plugs in them anymore. However, the lecture halls and some classrooms I've been assigned to use only have VGA sources. This has caused a good deal of frustration and hoop jumping to find solutions. UITS has NOT been helpful with this. University issued computers DO have HDMI plugs in them, so why aren't all rooms supplied with HDMI cords?  Last semester there was a significant problem with playing video's or items that had sound in them; MANY of my colleagues had the same difficulty that I did. Volume didn't work. UITS' solution, turn the system off and start over. That did not work either. This was an ongoing situation all semester, and in some rooms, it is still an issue [IRD]. We cannot offer our students excellent learning experience when we do not have the tools we need to provide those experiences.  This semester, I am having trouble with creating Rubrics in Canvas. I have now reported the problem twice in one months time, and there still isn't a solution. Students REALLY rely on Rubrics, and I am avoiding making them right now because there is so much difficulty in doing so. Again, this is unacceptable. I respect that some problems take time to resolve, [IRD] no one has followed up with a status or a resolution.  Finally, the DVD player in one of the classrooms I use [IRD] works, but the controller doesn't. Rather than fix the problem, we were told to use the DVD drive in the computer in the room. One of the discs we use doesn't work in the computer. The only alternative we have is to carry a computer to which we can attach an external DVD drive. Is there a policy against fixing things? The DVD we use is required for the course we are teaching. Why was it our problem to find a solution? Seems UITS should make sure the equipment they provide is in proper working condition, or perhaps they should replace it.  Usually the equipment is well maintained and when I get to class is ready for use. The problems encountered are usually the first week of classes.  Is there a way for UITS to connect remotely to the classroom equipment to see if it could be fixed?  I have enjoyed working with our tech experts in terms of keeping our office computers up to date, developing technical resources for a new space we developed at IUPUI University Library and working on projects related to student enrollment and CRM software.  As a new department chair, there have been a number of IT administrative systems that I have had to get access to and learn how to use. While I have been helped in figuring most of this out, there have been some glitches and lag-time involved--a more systematic training process would be helpful. On the other hand, attention to computer issues has been prompt and, so far, no serious classroom technology issues.  Overall my interactions with UITS have been positive. With the exception of classroom technology. (Which maybe isn't directly under UITS? I confess the reporting lines are confusing.) I was teaching in a classroom in CA last year and the projector/monitor would not stay on. It kept shutting off every few minutes. I called the classroom technology help number and basically was told there was nothing they could do to help me. I couldn't show anything to the class and my session depended on being able to display things via the projector/monitor. It was really frustrating.  I have always had good interfaces with the helpdesk when I have called. Our IT staff for our department does a good job for the amount of users and tasks that they are assigned.  I have had good and bad experiences with UITS. First it was the bad interaction: being told incorrect information. Then when I decided to just use the chat service, I finally got the information I needed and help clarifying what I needed to do, which I deem the good interaction. I am only putting this down so that someone is aware that certain employees have incorrect information that they are passing along, as well as not being able to look up the correct information before informing people about what they need to do.  Mitch was very efficient and helpful with my new computer set-up - thanks so much!  Staff is friendly.  We need to make changes to our IU Infectious Diseases fellowship website and have had discussions with IT.  I believe due to lack of staff, our project has not been completed. This directly affects the hiring process of fellows.  I almost always have a great experience when I call 274-HELP. I haven't taken IT training classes recently but found them much too slow paced and not learner centered. The courses offered via the teaching centers are better and I wish there were more on learning technology. I wish all of our conference and classrooms were equipped with Zoom and more universal systems. I teach and work at both IUB and IUPUI and things are challenging because of such differences across schools, departments, and campuses.  I can't think of any issues beyond occasional glitches with Canvas.  I'm always very impressed with UITS staff and services--very helpful! I especially appreciate the call-in help and walk-in help. I've used these multiple times.  Some of the Canvas features: Kaltura and Zoom do not seem that intuitive. I have struggled at times with utilizing these platforms.  No recommendations! Glad to know they are available when needed.  Need a quick response.  It would be awesome to have one consolidated system so I don't have to repeat everything with IU and IUH.  Great folks. Quick service. Work hard to get concerns addressed.  I have always had positive interactions with UITS staff. Not involving staff, but the provided computer in my office does not allow me to download and use tools that help me in my grading (i.e. grammarly) which is quite a nuisance and then I just have to use my personal laptop in the end.  My interactions with UITS staff have always been productive, and the staff have always had a professional attitude. However, from a time perspective, the return on investment has been low.  My chief concern about this service is that I am dually employed by IU and IUHP. So, my devices need to be able to serve both jobs. I have had an extremely difficult time getting IUH IT and UITS to collaborate to make my devices fully functional. I am required to be the go-between for all issues, and I have no background in IT or software, or Wi-Fi or any number of other issues. So, it becomes a very frustrating game of telephone, wherein I finally just give up and live with a less than fully functional device.  UITS has been one of the most pleasurable departments to work with in my many rolls at IUPUI as a student and professional. I work in the technology and geospatial sciences and have interacted with many departments over the years from telecom, general support, software licensing and purchasing, and most recently last summer participated in a sUAS (drone) mapping demo last summer at IUB. Thank you all for your support and expertise. UITS is a core reason IU is a great university.  Whenever I have had an issue with classroom technology, UITS has responded promptly and helped me get class back on track.  Clinical departments create additional problems by adding software that is meant for PCs on Macs which creates major problems when working remotely. The responsiveness to fixing the problems is inadequate as several issues have not been resolved. I realize this is a PC campus but slowing productively of Faculty is not an acceptable practice.  I have not had any negative interactions with UITS staff ever! :)  I think UITS is a valuable service that has served my IT needs well.  When I set up my polycom phone after transferring from IUB to IUPUI, I had an excellent experience.  Overall staff has been resourceful and polite. Almost all issues have been resolved quickly.  Only had great and helpful interactions so far. Everyone seems to be knowledgeable on many topics and able to address concerns effectively.  Box Health needs to be replaced!! Every time that a file is downloaded on a computer, a temporary internet file is created on the laptop! Many people who use box health are not aware of this. This goes against every attempt to protect patient confidentiality. It is obvious that the people who implemented Box Health have never had to protect confidentiality and/or are not researchers. Please provide secure servers for researchers to store their data.  Everyone is always helpful and responsive to my needs.  UITS staff is knowledgeable and very helpful!  Positives: responsive, timely.  The computer provided to me at work is old and slow. The camera monitor to monitor patient condition at the console area is at least 25 years old, with bad resolution and not easy to operate.  I have always had phenomenal help from UITS when I call the help desk.  I have always received prompt and friendly service.  I mostly work with CAITS since I'm with the School of Medicine.  I have been frustrated by having to wait a long time to have the projectors in our library classrooms updated, but I don't know if that's a UITS project or a CAITS project.  Thanks for supplying free Microsoft Word.  Good experience. Great services. Convenient for students and faculty.  It's informative for us. Need more updates on new scientific discoveries and job vacancies.  Yes. [IRD], for some reason, I was the only provider with Printer Issues, no matter which computer I went to. The entire 8 hour shift, the nurse/staff coordinator called IT at least 6 times.  I could not print discharge instructions and some patients ended up leaving without discharge instructions. The IT person told our coordinator that with Cerner changes, some people had printer issues, and despite repeated requests to send someone down to look at the exact error message, no one came. This left a dangerous situation with some patients who didn't get discharge paper work or instructions/addresses/physician follow up information. The IT person didn't know to refer us to another on-call Desktop person who could come remedy the situation. 8 hours we waited for someone to show up. No one showed up in our ED. Was Very frustrated.  Most of my experiences with UITS has been very positive.  Sometimes the KB can be frustrating when it links me out to a community guide for platforms like Canvas or Box because then I have to start my search over again.  IU AnyWare is a great idea but very clunky on a Mac.  I find the IU security messaging to be patronizing and infantilizing. Thank you for letting faculty use the Box G Suite Integration!  Very good experience/interaction with UITS staff.  I always have very positive experiences with our IT staff at East. They are knowledgeable, friendly and always ready to help when I'm stuck, either in my office or classroom. They know what they are doing  and also have a good sense when something is really urgent--like when I'm in class trying to get technology to work well. I am so glad to have them here on campus.  I have also called off-hours several times and typically those folks are also helpful, and always friendly. I have struggled a couple of times though with less than helpful calls--one that comes to mind specifically was when I needed to verify I was creating \"Searchable Adobe Documents\". I called IT Helpdesk to ask for a way to verify this, and it was obvious the IT helper had no idea what I was talking about. His response was \"Well, just call the file something you remember when you save it, and then save it to your desktop--it will be searchable by looking on your desktop\". That was not helpful.  One of the projectors in LE100 projected a pink circle for the first month or so of the semester. I used this room in the fall semester and the projector was beginning to malfunction in November. This issue should have been addressed before the beginning of the Spring semester.  No immediate concerns.  They have been very helpful.  Lecture theaters should have the ability to allow guests logins to download or use presentation from a USB stick.  Lecture theater in Emerson Hall was most unfriendly in terms of ability to connect my Mac.  UITS is a great service for faculty. I love the 274-HELP phone line.  The staff should have more training to help faculty with canvas related issues and all the new teaching technologies. The CTL folks are very helpful but since they are not available 24/7, we should be able to get useful help from the UITS.  It would also help to hire some IT professionals who can also communicate in non-technical language so that a lay person can understand how to use the technology easily. Also, if the directions online about various technological tools are written so that they are user friendly that would help. Many of the directions use technical terms/words and they assume that the user knows exactly what they mean.  However, the user has to spend a lot of time decoding each sentence to figure out the full meaning of the sentence/words. This involves googling the words etc. and wastes a lot of precious work time that could be spent actually using the technology. Clear, easy to read and understand directions for a non- tech person are needed. I suggest hiring a few people who can easily translate technical language to everyday language, and also run some pre-tests and post-tests to gather information on the effectiveness of this.  UITS is always pretty darn good about quickly handling any issues I have. All the people I have ever worked with have been fantastic. Really no complaints from me at all.  No recent experiences.  The UITS staff are always giving me quick feedback and solve the problem. By now, I am very satisfied with UITS service. However, I still hope UITS can update some software with an expired license. Meanwhile, the wireless network speed is very slow.  I feel completely disconnected with technology services. They may be helpful for students; however, newly joining faculty does not seem to get into the loop at all. I do not know the overall concept and goals of IT services. If it were not for students and trainees that introduce me to needed features, I still would be entirely clueless. In fact, I just recently accidentally heard about UITS. Trial and error is the only approach that I know.  One reason may be that I am being overstuffed with emails virtually forcing me to delete everything that is not of life-threatening importance (literally). And all support branches at IU appear to be content to just overfeed faculty with those mails falsely believing they are making themselves known.  I probably received hundreds of UITS emails since I joined. I never had any meaningful contact.   ### Staff responses:  My interactions with IT staff have always been pleasant.  I've worked at three other universities and I feel that UITS is as good if not better than what I've been exposed to in the past.  I have never had a negative experience with UITS. Its staff, as well as its website have been very resourceful from my time as a student to my time now as an employee. When I began as an employee, the UITS staff person I spoke with to help transition from my old student account was very knowledgeable, friendly, and efficient. I've also utilized KnowledgeBase successfully for a number of issues.  I have always had pleasant experiences with UITS staff. They seem to always be quick to respond and fix any issues as well as professional and knowledgeable. No complaints.  All UITS interactions I have initiated have been positive.  We are a lucky department that has our own IT systems specialist and so my interactions with UITS staff are limited. Most have been positive though trying to describe an issue over the phone is mostly an exercise in futility.  UITS has been easy to work with when I have had questions.  Not sure what the \"Request Software\" feature in IU Ware is for. I thought perhaps someone could look into the feasibility of getting a license for a particular software but was told that they couldn't help me. Maybe the function of this service should be better explained on the page?  The UITS staff have always been super helpful and prompt whenever tech problems plague our office. Recently I had to have my laptop changed out and they made the transition completely painless.  Overall the staff does a good job. I would like to see the request forms streamlined into one, but understand this may not be possible with the different work groups.  I have made use of the UITS chat help service many times and have always found it helpful and efficient.  I work in the Herron Art Library and students using the building computer labs frequently ask us for help with problems (rooms locked, printers broken, software questions). As we have no control over the labs, better communication about those rooms or obvious staffing would be helpful.  It's probably pertinent to note that our technology is administered by CST in the University Library and I have little interaction with UITS outside of that.  I work fairly closely as I support some enterprise systems and need to regularly collaborate and partner with a handful of teams and product owners.  I often find that no one can help me, but instead, they often pass me to a different department who ultimately sends me back to the desk I first called. The disconnect between CAITS and UITS is very poor.  I don't exactly know if I've worked with UITS staff. Our office has someone who helps us with computers, website, and other general technology related questions. But, I am not under the impression that we rely upon UITS services for this sort of thing. When I've needed anything related to One.iu.edu, I assume I'm working with someone from UITS and believe I get the information I need in a timely manner.  One issue/concern I had was when we started using Qualtrics as an institution. There was no training available from UITS and we were told there were no plans to offer training. I thought that was unacceptable given I (and others) had no control over nor input into the decision to disallow the use of Survey Monkey. How are you going to force people to use a new product and then not offer training? I've basically taught myself how to use Qualtrics. In hindsight, it's a much better product than Survey Monkey, but the first semester using it was frustrating.  I have very positive experiences and support from Adam (no longer at IUPUI), Devin, Michael, and Davis. They have all been very professional and helpful every time I have had an issue and needed their help. I have nothing but good things to say about their service in my unit.  I have had great experience for the past 3 years. Long time ago, 2006, it took too long for them to answer the phone but now they have become so efficient.  I have only had positive interactions with UITS staff. They are always so helpful when I call.  Connectivity in Taylor Hall is spotty at best. I'd love to see more investment in making Wi-Fi more accessible in Taylor.  I am concerned that CAITS is understaffed. Someone is supposed to be checking the auditorium equipment on campus either every day or every evening. Specifically those auditoriums in Fesler Hall and the Medical Science Building. The equipment, most of the time, is not set up correctly to display the monitor to the PowerPoint screen. Nor is the microphone or the pointer charged with good batteries. And there are no spare batteries to be had. Not to mention there are no working telephones in those rooms. Personal cell phones do not have service in those buildings. You must go outside to get service to call for help. Depending on how early in the morning or late in the evening you get a voice mail to leave a message. Not helpful when you are supposed to be giving a lecture.  Email forwarding for students between various accounts (@iu, @iupui) has been problematic. The instructions are either wrong or confusing and students are often missing important email communications due to lack of awareness or inaccurate routing between OWA and Gmail.  UITS has been good, on the whole. The only real complaint I have in 2.5 yrs was from a training session I was facilitating on the IUPUI campus in a room where UITS was supposed to provide support and it was challenging getting help. I called the UITS help desk, who routed me to another UITS line, who tried to get someone to come to give me assistance, thankfully I arrived 15 min early and had some time. It was a frustrating process and took far longer than I would have liked. Before the UITS tech arrived to assist, I was able to solve my own issue, but we started my training session 15 min late.  When I see UITS being constructively responsive to critical feedback from end users, my experience is positive. When I see UITS being defensive, dismissive, or digging in as a response to end user feedback, my experience is negative. UITS is at its best when it is supporting the seamless availability, security, and high performance of tools developed outside of UITS that best meet the needs of end users at IU.  I do not understand why IUPUI has so many independent maker spaces. It seems like IUPUI would spend fewer resources and have a better product to create one large maker space that encompasses all needs.  I have had good experiences with the UITS help desks around campus though I have had to walk them through what's happened with my accounts multiple times in order to get the correct assistance. I understand that they deal with wide range of skill sets and tech knowledge bases so I understand the urge to over question.  Quick responses.  When in need of help right away, I like the fact I can visit and talk to a real person to help solve my issues.  I want to give kudos to Justin White whose expertise and professionalism never disappoints. He knows what he is doing which is invaluable. Most of us do not have time for \"do-overs\" and that is never the case with Justin. He is my preferred go-to for any IT I might have!  Very quick to respond to requests and will update progress on user requests in a timely manner.  Would love to be able to install office add-ins such as boomerang.  I have had only a few instances since working here that I've interacted with and requested help from the UITS staff. One is very personable and friendly and the other is more introverted but does his job well.  UITS has always responded promptly to any of my concerns or questions. This has been greatly appreciated.  I am a member of [IRD]. I do not feel like UITS planning is done with [IRD] as a fully engaged member of the UITS community. IT Security appears to be focused on what the general campus is concerned with and not engaged, or open, to the concerns of the [IRD] needs on the IUPUI campus and only consider issues related to the [IRD] schools after repeated attempts to engage them, running the concern up the chain of command or needing to get a school Dean involved to move issues forward.  UITS Staff are usually responsive & polite. Small/simple issues are usually solved quickly and painlessly. Occasionally, when there is an issue, there is a feeling of being \"left hanging\" because there is no solution for the problem at hand (i.e. time-sensitive issues during a presentation). Often, most issues could be resolved by better preparations (likely on both ends). I often prefer to find my own work-arounds because the amount of time/effort needed to work with UITS is not worth the end solution. I've found some interactions difficult due to the lack of human interaction skills on the technician's end.  The computers in our facilities are very slow, and the nightly reset makes it hard to be able to send and check emails in a timely manner.  Negative concerns are students do not have good wireless service. Every other campus I have visited has wonderful wireless service everywhere on campus - inside buildings as well as outdoors. Our wireless connectivity/service is embarrassing. School of Medicine classes are now using notebooks and other devices, and there are classrooms in Med Sci which cannot be used due to lack of or sporadic service. Please fix this.  I rarely contact the help desk, but had a positive experience when I did.  No concerns at this time. All good.  When reaching out via chat, the UITS staff members have been very helpful and even reached out to gather additional information for troubleshooting and avoiding future problems. Regarding services such as AdRx, I would like to have more abilities to pull reports of students and their notes for those I have met with. Additionally, I would like to see additional presentation resources available for those of us teaching courses, presenting regularly, etc.  UITS staff is always very helpful and responsive. Great to work with.  Great staff.  I have worked closely with the UITS Advanced Visualization Lab and Virtual Reality staff for over four years. Chauncey Frend has been an amazing supporter of our academic unit. Up until a week ago, he was leading tours for our recruitment team when we invited potential high school students and their families to visit us. I have been very thankful to have him partner with us. We are saddened that they will no longer host our K-12 tours.  Complaints/issues are usually met with quick response, whether it is an immediate fix or a \"we're working on it\". I know part of the time it is user issues, but we really do try to go through all the possible problems (reboot, clear cookies, etc.) first.  We work very closely with Ron Voter and Keith Koontz who have always been very helpful and fast with their responses to our needs.  Everyone I have worked with from UITS have been very helpful! Much appreciated!  It would be helpful for the UITS staff to understand that many of the School of Medicine sites are not on IU campuses. Some have campus affiliations with other universities and reside in a city where no regional campus exists and a handful are affiliated with IU campuses. IU School of Medicine - South Bend is the only site in the same city as a Regional campus that does not reside on that campus.  Routinely UITS staff will suggest that we simply go to the IUSM UITS support center, but it is not that easy for our employees and students. We do not have parking privileges on that campus and most do not even know where that is.  Additional comment after the survey is that this survey was way too long!  The UITS staff have always been very helpful. It would be nice to have an integrated IU and IU Health IT department due to the never ending challenges faced by those of us who work for both.  After taking this survey I realize there are many security related resources I was unaware of. Perhaps more education/getting the word out would help.  I wonder if there are services which are under-utilized because people don't know they are offered. I have never found the central location at which new services are announced. Often I only learn of the existence of a service when I see in change management that it is scheduled for maintenance. It is irksome to have spent considerable effort to set something up for our department, only to learn later that (had I known) an acceptable alternative was already offered by UITS.  First of all, we need even and strong internet connection and security on the IUPI campus. Second of all, campus facility services excess is not executed well, to get on computer or shall I say trying to get your phone service to connect with two tier verification by phone is poor. The internet coverage is not good. I understand that some buildings are hard to get internet coverage, that is why we need good infrastructure for the internet on all IU campuses.  They do a great job. I appreciate all their help.  Communication of UITS services to the rest of the campus, particularly faculty, remains a challenge.  Very concerned about the state of consolidation across the university when it comes to the IT organization. You can't automate good, local customer service. Neither can you automate relationships, which create trust. We're becoming more technical and less personal.  I've seen too many good ITLP graduates leave because you didn't allow them to lead. It's still happening. Please stop putting non-ITLP graduates and others who have no desire to lead in their leadership journey path.  Great responsive service team!  Able to help/answer questions in a timely manner.  I rated the CTSI website question a 3 because of the recent poorly introduced new site that now direct inquires to the studies that I manage to some unknown person that sometimes forwards those inquires to me. I don't think this has anything to do with UITS, but rather the people that decided to change policy without informing anyone.  My biggest frustrations come from Skype for Business and Box. Group IMs/chats are much more difficult than they should be in 2019, and if you join one late, you can't see what has already been said. Something like Slack would be really helpful for my team. Box is great in theory, but it can be temperamental and really slow down a meeting when it is doing something weird, like not allowing a document to be opened in Microsoft online.  Having IT on campus has been a big plus however, DUO has continued to be an issue with our Volunteer Community, requiring an IU email is an added burden and the username is confusing. Why don't you just do what other companies do and use the full email address? Fax did not work at all and sometimes too much information is not the answer. For non-tech people, keep the info simple or have a novice read and give you feedback. Calls are not answered and Volunteers should not have to fill out a \"ticket\". Password resets have also been a problem. IU forgets we have regional campuses and Volunteers cannot come in to campus and show ID! IT support only thinks in black and white terms and does not listen or understand the needs of staff and Volunteers. I am only referring to staff needs since I cannot answer for faculty or students.  My experience is that UITS and Ricoh (the copy machine company) do not communicate well. I have had multiple interactions in setting up new printers/copiers where they force me to be the middle man instead of talking to each other to get the thing set up. Or they'll say, \"oh, we can't do that.\" You need to talk to Ricoh. And vice versa. Very frustrating.  They do help you.  I have not had to use them, but every time someone is in my building they are nothing but positive and always say hello.  I've had nothing but good experiences with UITS. They are very prompt and courteous when handling the tickets.  I really have no comments, complaints or requests. The network and systems work for me as I suspect they are supposed to work.  UITS staff typically respond pretty rapidly to requests!  Whenever the server is down can a text message be sent out? Putting it on the Peds IT home page isn't useful if you can't access it.  All of my interactions with UITS staff have been very good, and that has spanned my 23 year career here. I cannot think of any negative interactions or a time when my concerns weren't addressed.  Learn to love and be patient with everyone.  I do not have anything negative to say. When I have asked for help with any issues I have, they have responded quickly. You can't ask for anything more.  I've always had satisfactory or excellent experiences with UITS staff and services. Timely, skillful, and thorough.  All of my interactions with UITS staff have been positive. They have all been very helpful and quick to resolve issues.  Why are we always changing systems? They get to the point where they are working and then we change them. Chrome River is bad.  The support in chat has very much improved. I was able to have my problems resolved quickly. I work remotely and use the vpn, so sometimes there are other factors involved when I run into problems.  I would recommend a SQL training course that is similar to the Excel and Access certification series available on the UITS site. I completed both the Excel and access certification series and they were very beneficial to my learning and greatly helped with my work at IU.  I have had nothing but pleasant experiences with the PedsIT staff that I have had here. I don't think I've had to specifically call UITS, just my local IT area. It would be nice to find an easier way to know what classes were offered to employees to help with using different programs.  It would be nice for UITS to help groups adapt to group wide changes that they make. For instance if UITS were to re-name a printer, they could leave instructions for the whole group of users to fix the printing issues that would result from the re-name.  I think the current IT staff is incredibly responsive and diligent.  Feel like the Wi-Fi outside could be strengthened and can be helpful during my summer camp since a lot of time is spent outside.  I work in the IU School of Medicine. I am in an IU Health facility. I am very disappointed that since my computer is a School of Medicine computer, IU Health help desk can't help me and treats me like I'm from another company. I thought we were all IU. I have frequent computer issues because the School of Medicine server has to talk to the IU Health service and they don't communicate well. I wish IU Health would recognize the need to assist IU School of Medicine with their computer connections. Our IU School of Medicine IT support had issues with IU Health trying to get our printers and computers set up. Since my department is School of Medicine, IU Health was not helpful to our School of Medicine IT support staff. It took many phone calls and weeks to get data jacks activated so we could function properly. Totally unacceptable. We are all IU just different entities, not different companies.  UITS staff are always nice and professional and try to help, but they are very busy. The centralization of campus UITS has not worked thorough at all in my opinion and each school needs to have their internal, specialized IT dept.  Everyone that I have talked and worked with has been a great experience, they have been very helpful.  UITS helped me when I had trouble with my school laptop. They were quick and explained the problem clearly so I understood.  UITS staff have always been super helpful and quick to respond! I also appreciate the information on the website when it comes to navigating pieces of technology  Quick response times; I have always gotten a solution to the issues I've had.  Overall, I found interactions with UITS staff to be helpful and pleasant. Response times from Managed Print Services lagged.  UITS staff are always helpful when I have called in to address a tech issue.  Some initial thoughts that come to mind:  -           UITS can feel like an amorphous blob at times (who do I contact for what, how can I get faster service for last minute issues).  -           I don't often need to contact them, which is a good thing. Things are working.  -           I would really like to see IU push open-source options and tools. Or at least make a pathway for options for those that request. As IUAnywhere and the like become more common, other steps can be done to allow better support of Linux, etc. as the host system.  -           It would be nice if IU Secure would be considered for access outside the buildings. At least a few feet from the buildings, or at least in dense areas like on Campus. Having my signal drop in and out randomly because it cuts off JUST enough to be useless, but just enough to not trigger solid mobile is exceptionally annoying. And as more VOIP and alerts will come through our devices, this seems like a logical next step.  It's been immense pleasure working here at IU. I am working as an Associate Web Developer for WebHelp, UITS and my recommendation is place hand sanitizers available to the people (staff/students) in the accessible points like hall and walkways of the campus.  Staff have always been very helpful.  Most of our IT pain results from the (lack of) interactions between IU and IUH systems and networks. Having our departmental IT group (Peds IT, in IUSM) helps a lot, but there is always a lot of finger- pointing between the two entities and not always the best results/most useful solutions. It's understandable, but it still makes work difficult and way more complicated than it should be.  I have no problems with UITS or CAITS. Issues that I submit to these groups are always handled professionally and in a timely manner.  The support chat line has been really helpful in random times of need.  The internet services are adequate for me.  When I have to reach out to UITS, I find that they are prompt with a response, and typically have a solution for my issues. This is very nice.  An issue I do have is with the phone systems. HD Voice touch screen phones, I believe are supposed to pair with the skype for business app on my desktop. However, it does not play too nicely if more than one user is logged into the desktop/phone system. It cannot handle multiple users and cannot toggle between multiple accounts on a desktop. It really pains me, and I cannot figure out how to login to my phone. Say for example...I get everyone off of the desktop and I restart etc. etc...If I sign in I cannot sign into the phone. Someone from UITS did eventually I believe come to our lab to help me set up the phone. This refresh actually worked for about a week. Then the phone system crashed and signed me out and I didn't have a PIN to log back in. I also don't know how to request a new PIN or override. I cannot pair the device either. It is unfortunate.  I wish that there was a way for the skype for business, polycom, and all of the other various user interfaces to not pop up on my desktop every time I sign in. Basically I can sign in and sometimes have to wait for 5 minutes until my desktop has fully loaded every single thing that is installed...that kind of sucks.  The Wi-Fi connectivity could be WAY better in my opinion. I have a windows surface pro as my work laptop. I can be completely signed in and fully functional in one room of my building. If I literally just lock my surface to carry it to literally the room next door the Wi-Fi connection will die, and I have to restart the lap top and resign into the Wi-Fi and resign into the desktop and wait another 5 minutes for the desktop to load all of its stuff...you get the picture...basically I don't see why moving 10 feet makes a connectivity issue. I would recommend better Wi-Fi.  No recommendations.  In my 7 months here I have had a positive experience with any technology issues.  When I first started, I had a positive experience with IT. They helped me get my computer set up and helped with my phone situation.  I would like to see all of the technology services supported through one department/company. I feel like we shouldn't have to go through several different companies depending on where we work.  The only real problem I have is with the link system. 1) Many times I am required to sit at someone else's computer. In order for me to do my job, I need phone access. I have to log them out of their computer/link system which threatens any of their unsaved work. 2) It always pops to the \"primary screen\" when a call comes in, I haven't found a way to hide it so it doesn't. 3) Probably the most annoying, the first call of the day always gets dropped/won't connect.  Several systems provide the same type of information for students (iGPS, degree maps, AAR, ...) and they are not always correct, or complete. Students are confused and sometimes led off-track by this.  I have always had a great response from the IUTS staff. They are timely in responses--both to acknowledge they have seen your issue and to come work on it. The only recommendation I could think of is to make more options for 'remote-in'. I believe I've had some updates done to my computer that they had to come to my office for, but I thought it might be easier for them to simply remote in.  Good response time to issues.  All of my UITS experiences have been positive. Every request has been promptly responded to.  I have only had positive experiences with the UITS staff so far.  We have had repeated issues with non connectivity in classroom spaces and offices.  I love that UITS is available 24/7 for computer help. My students have reported that this service has been very helpful. I have had less positive experiences as a staff person trying to get training on or assistance with particular applications, particularly Salesforce. It is not at all intuitive, and the training we received consisted of a Zoom session with a staff person (not a trainer) talking us through it. A lot of technical language was used, and it only made us more confused.  I would love for computer classes that are offered to be held in Fairbanks or Hits building.  All interactions have been very professional and the UITS staff has been easily accessible for questions, thanks!  I am an IU employee in an IU Health building (with IU employee equipment) so there has been a lot of difficulty regarding who is responsible for which part of a process/repair. In particular with wireless and not-wireless internet connectivity. The UITS and IU Health IT staff were all very knowledge and attempted to help to the best of their ability, but the limited communication between the 2 sides made the process very difficult and lengthy and also relied on my limited understanding of the technology to communicate who had tried which thing, between the 2 sites.  I got a new laptop/computer within the past year, and it has already needed a rebuild. IT has been great about responding to the problems, but the computer error cost me a PTO day at home instead of being able to work as hoped.  The HELPNET/TechSelect staff are always very quick to respond and extremely nice in their interactions. CTS is also very customer focused and we appreciate them as well.  When having issues with something outside these areas, UITS support is always friendly and helpful as well, for example, with Canvas questions.  My experiences with the TechSelect group have been positive.  Unclear about what we can contact UITS about versus the school's IT support. The school's IT support is often not helpful as it is usually a student without experience troubleshooting business related IT issues so many things end up unresolved or a \"Band-Aid\" fix, take a very long time to troubleshoot, or eventually figured out by non-IT staff (co-workers, other staff).  I have always had great encounters with UITS.  Sometimes the response time can be slow. If one person starts your ticket and another person needs to finish. The 2nd person doesn't always know what was already tried. Maybe a log sheet would be nice.  The ITHelpLive chat is great. It is the first place I go to when faced with an issue.  I've only had one direct interaction with UITS. Last summer we needed to have some of their computers moved because we were using the space while a renovation was done in our building. The staff responded and moved the computers quickly after my request.  UITS staffing at the Dental School seems to change regularly. And sometimes service is delayed because there are only 2 or 3 people. They are pleasant to work with, but one issue I submitted on Friday required several follow up requests, and was only resolved today when the faculty member went downstairs.  It would be helpful to have one main person to connect to obtain solutions that occur and need immediate attention.  Staff members are always available and willing to assist students coming from outside the institution and need to set up their access for e-mail, Canvas, and other sites.  I have been very pleased anytime I have had a question. The Staff has been quick to respond and take care of any problems I was having.  I don't have any concerns as I haven't had much interaction with UITS. I do appreciate the emails with news from UITS.  For the minor tickets I have submitted the issue is taken care of immediately or within a day. When I have urgent matters or \"longer\" tickets, it seems that it takes time to get back to me. I would like to have more information about UITS and its capabilities.  No concerns, only positive experiences.  I love the chat feature for help at IUPUI. I would love more webinar tutorials and tips on the most frequently used software besides SIS. I wish the search feature in KB was more intuitive. I also wish all the systems spoke to each other. It would be nice to have communication when Adobe or other software is updated and affects user login. I find most of those things out by running into a usage problem.  Thanks for all you do!  I have had a good experience with uits.  Traditionally, UITS had been slow to respond due to their overwhelming number of urgent requests. However, I have seen improvement in timeliness and resolution.  It is hard to find where you need to go for help; I would much rather speak to someone than wait for a response on an incidence report; the Knowledge base search is very confusing.  My interactions with UITS have been positive.  My experience with submitting issues for help tickets is that they often get lost. I typically contact my IT staff directly and they are great about helping. I don't know why the ticket system seems ineffective.  I have reported what I thought was a phishing email and received a response indicating that the email came from outside the system and nothing can be done. While I understand if this is the truth, that messaging does not encourage me to continue reporting these issues. My assumption is that a submission is both to fix an issue that can be or to make us aware of a scam to prevent issues. I know I have had colleagues receive similar messaging and were surprised as it seemed an inconvenience that we were trying to report something we found sketchy. I anticipate a simple change in messaging would prevent staff from feeling discouraged when trying to do the right thing and report harmful emails.  I am very pleased with UITS across the board.  They are quick to respond when I need help.  My role is full cycle faculty HR, so my interest is making their experience top notch and reducing administrative barriers for them and the staff who support them. There are so many systems that we use (which do not talk to each other) for faculty, from People Admin for posting jobs to HRMS for hiring, DMAI for annual reviews, eDossier for P&T, etc...  It is frustrating that these systems do not speak in order to have a \"source of truth\" for faculty data as well as for faculty and staff to not have to enter duplicative information in various systems.  Additionally, approval workflows for different campuses vary and IUPUI has some cumbersome approval processes that we have recently learned do not exist in Bloomington. Would love to see these streamlined. For instance, faculty cannot get early access to email because of the hiring process at IUPUI which is tied to HRMS approvals. And UITS does not want affiliate accounts to be used for this purpose. This makes it challenging for faculty to transfer grants, post syllabi, schedule meetings, etc... prior to start date.  HRMS and IUIE are insufficient for faculty data management. We have to create our own \"shadow systems\" as a result to track faculty.  When system changes are considered, getting more input from end users is CRITICAL. Having systems analysts design these systems in a vacuum (e.g. in IUB Academi Affairs) is not working and a huge source of frustration. We are told changes cannot be made because of bandwidth but we were never asked for input on system design and yet we are supposed to champion and use these systems. Much more attention to end user design is needed in faculty, HR, and finance systems from my experience.  I have not had any negative interaction with UITS. Whenever I have needed assistance, the team has been very responsive and accommodating!  As a Mac based user I have found the support IT staff to be outstanding, they work with you until the issue has been resolved.  Thank you!  I've had good experiences with the UITS staff.  Slow to get things done.  Clinton Wade and his pal Bennett (sp?), as well as student consultants Coty and Cameron are always nice, positive, and friendly. They are also competent and very responsive. Please give them raises.  My experience with UITS services and/or staff have always been positive and helpful.  As an employee, I wish that all university machines had the IUPUI and IU fonts pre-loaded on them. I have to put in a ticket with my technology services for them to download the fonts for me since I am not an administrator.  I also wish that SIS was more user-friendly. The endless codes and pages make it difficult to find information. As someone who uses SIS daily, I feel like I got no training on how it actually functions or interacts with other systems across campus. I also wish that all units had to use the same CRM or at least databases that can talk to each other. In my role I work with a lot of other units across campus and each office has their own homegrown system for recording all sorts of information and it is a pain to try and share data.  UITS always helps me when I call. I appreciate their help immensely.  Appreciate when the IT staff can train additional functions in video conferencing. Also, staff providing alternative pathways to users unable to access through normal connections. In regards to improvements, I work with individuals with limited understanding of IT and understand general terminology such as access to a browser, etc. Is there any type of online visual tutorials that explain the set-up of Duo, etc. outside the knowledge base. The knowledge base language can be confusing  for the limited user. Also, having a class in how to use different type of video equipment - and access to video conferencing - such as using zoom or other platforms.  274-Help is always helpful. The cloud-based software is more challenging.  [IRD]  In that time I have never had UITS provide any service that was expedient, useful, flexible or responsive to our needs in the [IRD] Program. Moreover, and a program that uses a great deal of technology we could greatly benefit from a decent partnership with UITS. Unfortunately, that has not been the case for my colleagues or me. We have tried to work on projector and classroom support, on Wi-Fi connectivity, and on a print management system that could meet our needs. The response from UITS has always been uncreative, silent, or uselessly expensive in terms of time and money.  My experiences are positive. UITS staff members are knowledgeable and dependable, quick to respond to needs.  Constantly changing formats, systems, infrastructure, and software reduces productivity that costs time and money. Functional systems should be left alone rather than upgraded every year or two.  All of my experiences are positive, one issue I have is sometimes the requests I send in are needed to be done day of, but a technician usually won't answer until the next day or so.  I hate Adobe Cloud - I have issues signing into Adobe using my IU ID on my work computer. I wish we had the old version. Overall, the free software (which is amazing, yes) moving more towards Cloud has been frustrating with issues trying to download but it not letting me login.  Timely response.  I've had nothing but positive experiences.  Very efficient and helpful for my issues.  In general, the CHAT feature is awesome. Staff are always very friendly. Always very helpful when classroom technology issues arise! Only compliant is that it's difficult to get things escalated beyond the front line staff when there are issues that need further analysis due to complex situations.  The new Chrome River travel system is very cumbersome and not easy to manage. I have not been happy with the transition to this new system.  Generally speaking I have been pleased with UITS services and have had no major concerns. The systems implemented by IU itself are generally well designed and implemented.  I find the technology support staff in my building (University Hall) to be extremely helpful, courteous, and informed. I have no complaints.  UITS is not easy to work with - not easily accessible to fix computer issues quickly and very slow in getting new machines out. There are significant issues between IU and IUH systems interacting.  Video conferencing technology is abysmal.  We have an on-going request from our faculty (IUSM) to allow us to set up their initial email address for them. This is for paid and unpaid faculty. It would greatly serve us with the onboarding process.  I have had to use UTIS on a couple occasions for questions in regards to equipment set up in one of our conference rooms here at the HITS Building. Each time I have called, the person answering has been super helpful! If I've needed someone to come to help in person, they have always come in a timely manner!  Overall, I am very satisfied with the IT environment on campus and I work with a great team who keeps growing and updating with every new change technology throws at us. Thank you for sending out this survey to make IU's IT even better!  I have not had many interactions but the few I have had were positive experiences. Very helpful when I was locked out of my computer. On some of the software downloads it may be helpful to provide step by step instructions for download.  I have had wonderful service from UITS staff. They are helpful and patient. The only thing that needs to be replaced is Zoom. Most of the time there are technical difficulties, the audio is horrendous, the print on the screen (if attending in person) is horrible, and you can't see everyone who is attending remotely. It is a horrible program and it needs to be replaced with another product that works.  We do not get good Wi-Fi in the Med Science building. It's very frustrating.  I love the immediate email acknowledgement when submitting a ticket; I would like to see the expectations as to when someone will start the work. I would like to see a periodic review of our network and printer access. Multiple occurrences of slow performance for both. I would suggest a brochure listing all of the IT services and hardware available. I was totally unaware of a number of options until I completed this survey.  Kali time sometimes goes down at the oddest of times and sometimes the clock station computers too. I've had multiple times that I had to do missed punch but couldn't do it. The printers we have are also awful and our IT strongly says there is nothing wrong with the machine. I have not had to have much else to do with the system and I am fine with most IT.  I typically seem to get the help needed when I call.  Super happy with current services. Walk-in and phone-in for personal devices is a key benefit that makes me think twice before I might leave IU. All technicians seem to be expert in everything!!  TechSelect is very responsive and also an expert with my office needs.  I had to get a new crimson card last year and the student worker was great.  UITS has always been very knowledgeable and prompt when I needed them for assistance.  I have had to use services and staff help to sort out public computers in presentation rooms that were malfunctioning. All staff has always been courteous and even came out to diagnose a computer. We were unfortunately unable to present, but we at least saw people working to fix the solution.  I have always had a fast response rate from UITS and have been met with kind professional service.  Everyone is friendly.  I don't have anything to add at this time.  I have always had great experiences. Student and professional staff are helpful, knowledgeable, and prompt.  I'm indifferent.  It has been great. However, wireless network needs to be improved. When our research monitors visit our site, the can't access the wireless network. I can't even tell if the institution has a wireless network.  Generally the staff is prompt and helpful.  Ok  They have always been very responsive to my needs - especially when trying to set up an electronic meeting on Zoom.  I think the student center remodel and Medical Library \"Grab N' Go\" was a great idea.  I find most aspects of working with UITS favorable. I find most often that people are knowledgeable in their roles and provide guidance and service wherever applicable.  An area of improvement would be the UITS review of redundant services through SSSP. They really only focus on very specific enterprise solutions and do not look at something from a more holistic approach. I would recommend that each functional area within UITS have insight into the review process and can provide expertise on items that my impact their portion of the organization.  The 2 or 3 times I have put in a ticket, it was followed by uncertain personnel. There was never a solution and emails that never helped me. I usually figured it out without their help.  I really appreciate that I can call UITS at any time day or night because I have had to call in the middle of the night before. I do wonder why when I am parked in the parking lot at CAPS I am not connected to IU Secure, but when I am inside the building at CAPS I am connected to IU Secure.  Greg Brenner is so kind and courteous. He's a pleasure to work with.  If all of the conference rooms in University Hall could be swapped over to the same system as 5023, that would make our lives so much better!  I will not call UITS for technology help unless I absolutely have to. More than one person has been curt, not willing to explain their response, and not helpful.  Outstanding services provided by UITS. No issues. :)  to review   ### Undergraduate responses:  Have a place for UITS help in the campus center and not just in IT.  Haven't had any interaction.  I have had nothing but positive reviews about the UITS staff. Recently, my computer broke down and did not have Microsoft Office included. The UITS staff member (I do not remember their name) was very knowledgeable about MS Office and installed it onto my computer in no time. If you have a problem with your computer that prevents you from being able to complete your school work, visit UITS and they will more than happy to solve your IT problems!  I have had no issues, nor do I have any ideas for new services.  They fixed a bad projector almost immediately after the professor asked, which was nice.  I am a happy customer so to speak. IT staff are able to assist with issues they are not responsible for, in fact the office of the registrar and office of admission should be absorbed into IT due to their incompetence.  Very helpful  I am concerned with the possibility of 5g service coming to IUPUI's campus, I would not feel safe if that were to happen.  Quick tech support and good support questions/answers.  Printers are a little confusing to first-year students.  Logging in with Duo in the testing lab is annoying if the code expires. Internet keeps disconnecting even in buildings.  UITS has always been very helpful to me and problems I have had. They always resolve the issue and explain everything to me. If possible an improvement to the UITS area of expertise would be improving internet issue diagnostics relative to students campus housing. I've had issues in the past with campus internet and the UITS member could never check the connection from my devices.  Overall, I haven't had many issues with technology while at IUPUI. Setting up DUO on a new mobile phone recently was a little difficult to figure out but other than that no issues.  A crimson card app would be nice as the mobile experience for checking balances and whatnot leaves something to be desired. Also the Wi-Fi at the IT building is not always the best, specifically in room 255.  I had issues with connecting Wi-Fi to my Chromebook which I didn't know how to do.  I believe IUTS is such an integral part of our education here at IUPUI. It is also often one of the most underrated and unappreciated departments on campus. I have never had a bad experience with IUTS. Their service when dealing with issues are prompt and very courteous. Thank you for what you do.  Every time I interact with a UITS staff, they help me resolve my problems in many areas.  Wi-Fi and internet in the SL and LD buildings are horrible and needs to be improved.  I've always had timely and helpful interactions with UITS staff and don't have any recommendations at this time.  I haven't had any issues with the IT service/staff.  A positive experience would be during orientation the staff was able to help me with connecting to the Wi-Fi at the school. I have no negative experiences or suggestions.  I feel as with the amount of UITS being in building & iupui is different from building to building. Some I might see wondering the building checking the computers and printers. Others I might never see or they are just playing on the pc at there desk. One thing that is big is the projectors and trying to have uits make sure they are turned off or even somehow showing that the projector is blanked so that there is always going to be a working bulb.  I work for the University Library and I am constantly referring people to UITS whenever I cannot help them further. They are a great source to have here on campus.  Make sure Box Tools are updated and installed on every computer on campus. It isn't for the Campus Center PCs. This interferes with a student's ability to open a Box document and then save it back. Just something that makes sense to have on every computer. From my almost 4 years using the computers on Campus, I have only had two computers in the ET labs crash on me, which didn't end up being a big deal because I save often. Otherwise, the computers run well and they have a lot of good software.  Helped me change my last name, great.  I think they do a really nice job so far, although the hours suck. If I cannot receive help from the campus center later than 5pm I would have to walk to the building, which sucks when it is cold.  I've only had two interactions with UITS staff and they were very helpful both times.  I think the IU.one is not navigation friendly. I feel it is hard to find things on this page. I feel as though the word should be put out for some of the services that are offered, half of the things on the list I was unaware of. I didn't take many prerequisite classes at IUPUI and maybe this is why I was unaware of the available things because most of my time on campus is spent in the nursing building. Overall I am pleased with canvas and the ease of navigation on that page. I wish all instructors were taught how to use Kaltura because I find it helpful to be able to go back and watch lectures after I have attended them. I know a lot of instructors don't like to record them because they say people don't come but I do and also watch them. I feel it helps me. I think a class needs to be mandatory for instructors to learn how to use the equipment because I have noticed a lot of them don't know how to use what they have available.  The man I talked to with UITS was kind of sarcastically rude, which was really annoying. But in the end, after we couldn't figure out what was wrong with my phone, he finally figured it out and later emailed me to help me.  No specific interactions come to mind. Most of my interactions with UITS staff were very helpful. I have also noticed that the on campus WIFI has been rather slow in the spring semester. I didn't notice it first semester, but it seems slower now.  When my phone broke, I came to UITS to receive a password token to log into duo. I had a very positive experience. Although it was a long wait to get helped, it was a simple process to receive one.  The support staff was super nice and helpful in setting up my Duo token.  Bigger gym  I would recommend more people working at a time, especially for faster help. Most students hope to solve problems in-between classes. Any time I visit IT there is only one person at the help desk.  I haven't had any issues.  I have had positive interactions with the staff helping me set up the token for Duo and also help with printers. However, I would like to see an expansion in the UITS staff to have some people who are familiar with and able to fix some hardware problems rather than mere software issues. Many students expect to be helped with any and all problems since UITS does not specify that they can only fix software. Maybe clarify this on the website and publicity or expand your staff.  I heard about a friend who had asked how to upload a video to a canvas discussion but the staff told her \"that would be cheating, we can't help\".  I've had only a few issues with technology that required the assistance of UITS staff, but I would've been dead in the water without timely support. Each time I got what I needed quickly and politely.  I wish searching for and adding classes was easier.  The 24 hour hotline staff are always kind, patient, and helpful. I've called a handful of times and different times of the day and they've always walked me through the steps to solve my issues.  The printers on campus need more maintenance. There have been multiple times that I have been unable to print due to low ink, no paper, or it was just downright broken.  I love everything IT services does for the community and all it has to offer. I think personally it would be better if more apps were made to strengthen the community. One idea is study apps perhaps students that are into their studies could use it to contact students with experience or others that are in the same classes. Sometimes resources, such as the MAC, are closed so it is inconvenient. Sending a mass email is a Canvas issue because there is no send to all button that I am aware of any more. Lastly, often students are too shy or think ideas of reaching out to study groups is weird or out of their reach. The second I request is more services and programs as far as technology goes. I am aware of the virtual reality technology aware to students and programs such as malware detectors online on the website. It would be cool if there was a video-game emulator or a collection of movies, or just new programs to try even if they were prototypes from students or if there was just a few extra nifty programs we could use. If there is a vast amount of software such as video makers and such on the website, I think it should be advertised much more. Thank you for hearing me.  I have not had any interactions with UTIS staff, however everyone that I see always appears to smiling.  All my interactions with UITS were positive and I found help very easy to find and always on point.  There have been a few times that the Wi-Fi here on campus housing has stopped working and that is really inconvenient.  I find that issues with the printers occur a lot and sometimes I don't have enough time to try 3 or 4 more printers before what I need is due or just the will to do so in general. If there could be some way to track working printers on an app or something, that would be cool. I've seen that with laundry machines before.  I wish using the scanner was easier.  No problems at all.  I would love to see something that is equivalent to the MacSTAT for computer science majors. Such as being open every day whenever you need to go in to get help.  I haven't had the opportunity to interact with the UITS staff in the past, but I've witnessed them be very helpful in fixing equipment in classrooms and printers.  My laptop has never been able to connect to Wi-Fi but my iPhone has!  I have had really great experiences with using the online chat tech support. That is a great service that is provided that I have utilized several times.  I like it the way it is, but they should educate employees who work at the IT building to know how to help students with chemlab. I went there to get help with installing it into my computer and they literally had no idea what I was talking about or how to do it. It was pretty sad.  I do not interact with UITS directly, but when I do have a concern, it filters to them fairly quickly and becomes resolved in a timely fashion.  I think the staff is great! They have been helpful whenever an issue occurs.  The only time I have been to UTIS was when I got my token and the lady at the desk was very nice and helpful. I have had trouble in the past trying to download creative cloud on my laptop, but have not went to UTIS for help.  I have always had great service from UITS the few times I have called.  I don't have anything negative to say about the staff, they are all extremely helpful whenever I need anything. One issue I have encountered is slow Wi-Fi in the Library here at IUPUI.  There needs to be a different way to test remotely other than Examity. The service is cumbersome, invasive, and irritating.  I have no negative experiences with UITS thus far. I do think that there should be UITS stations in every building to help with technical issues. I feel that would make students and myself with technical issues more convenient to get fixed better than trying to make time to go over to UITS.  Get rid of Duo, improve the Wi-Fi on campus.  I've heard they are great and very helpful!  UITS was really helpful last semester when I was trying to get my forwarded emails changed.  On multiple occasions I have felt discriminated against by UITS staff. I'm consistently asked to move, constantly being monitored, and disturbed by UITS staff. It's not a very welcoming environment overall.  Should update iu app. Whenever I download the app, I can open the email so I always need to go back the browser. Good for nothing IU app.  I will recommend to a friend.  Need to improve internet service for more consistent use, Wi-Fi cuts out in residence buildings and some buildings on campus have poor signal, particularly IT. Certain computer labs on campus lack specific software, I recommend posting lists of available software per room.  I have difficulty hooking up my wireless TV provider and wireless printer to the system. If there was a way to hook it up to either IU Secure or ATT, there should be a pamphlet or document available for students to hook up their equipment. We spend hundreds of dollars on our equipment, we should be able to use it.  I've had trouble with connecting to IU Secure at times, and I take my computer in to get it checked. All the staff are very kind and considerate and explain things very well.  I have not had any experiences with UITS staff and services...yet. Though I have heard from other students that UITS staff are great to get along with and that their services are quite helpful. I hope that whenever I do need help, the UITS staff will be just as great!  I think the staff have been a great help when I need them!  I had trouble connecting to the Wi-Fi. UITS quickly identified my IU password change was the reason.  I had trouble downloading EndNote and UITS was able to help. This was very important because I was working as a research assistant and needed the tool to work.  Someone hacked my computer on campus (webcam turned on) and a UITS professional helped run some tests and found the likely method of attack. My webcam has not turned on since.  Some of the Wi-Fi doesn't work best in certain areas on my phone and computer. I hate that canvas always shuts down.  They are nice.  I have always had positive experiences when interacting with the UITS Staff.  I have found everyone I talked to at IT to be very helpful, positive, knowledgeable, and patient. No complaints from me.  I teaching recitations and often have to rely on the on campus Wi-Fi to ensure connection for Zoom to work. I have on occasion had to turn off the wireless on my phone and use that to teach because the internet was acting up and kept disconnecting on my laptop and/or was being a negative influence on me helping my students learn the best they can to be able to succeed in the class.  Downloads are fast and I've been happy to use free applications such as word.  I have had good experiences; they are helpful.  As a student and intern on campus, having my email switched fro Gmail to Outlook is a pain. I sometimes have to open an extra window to read the email and I can't get my phone to send me notifications. I don't understand the need to switch.  I have had positive experiences.  I work with UITS staff and they are all appropriately professional and do their job well.  I appreciate that the staff always ensures that the problem is resolved before you leave.  Having to use a cell phone verification each time logging onto a device on campus.  I have not had any personal experiences with UITS, however whenever there is a technology issue in a classroom they are always quick to respond and very helpful. I'm not sure if UITS handles IU anyware, but I use that constantly. A few years ago it was a bit of a pain to use the citrix receiver, but it works much better now and I hardly ever have issues.  All their software are free and all the computer on canvas are fast and swift. I just hate that we have to pay from basic printing.  I wish instructors would use Canvas in a consistent manner. Sometimes the syllabus is a Word or Excel file, sometimes it is embedded in Canvas. Sometimes Modules and Assignments list different types of things in different classes, or are incomplete, etc. Blackboard at Ivy Tech was used more consistently in my experience.  All interactions I have encountered have been positive.  I think UITS does a great job! They are always checking the printers and ensuring that students can print off resources. They always come quick to the classrooms when there is a technology problem.  Love my coworkers and work environment.  They always fix my problems and they are always patient with me.  Faster/ better network and internet  I haven't talked with a uits member for two years.  UITS helped me last semester to work out an issue with my IU account and Microsoft. It took a little while, but once it was fixed, I never had the issue again!  I haven't had much experience with UITS. My friend has, because she gets locked out of canvas/Wi-Fi a couple times a year and she just always has to call UITS, but no permanent solution is found. A professor this semester has also complained a BUNCH about UITS not getting back to her or telling her to try some steps to fix her issue that she already has tried. I remember UITS would come into my freshmen classes (bio 101, bio 103) to help students connect to TopHat, but I never see them otherwise. My internet connection on my smartphone SUCKS. I'm not connected half the time I'm on campus.  I have had plenty of interactions with UITS. My experiences have been mostly positive, with the worst experience being one where the person seemed somewhat tired and uninterested, but not rude. For any suggestions for new services, I have none. However, some improvements that could be made would be updating the user interfaces for some of the administrative applications. For example, the class registration application is difficult to use and it doesn't help that you have to use multiple applications to help visualize and test potential schedules.  Wi-Fi in the nursing building isn't get. I also get kicked off.  Not at the moment.  There are no negative concerns.  They helped me install Microsoft for free as an IUPUI student.  UITS has been very helpful during my first semester at IUPUI. They helped me with problems regarding email set up and canvas use.  Kaltura has been immensely helpful with succeeding in my classes.  I think it would be beneficial to have more printers with the color option. Also, the last couple of times I used the colored printing option, the color did not show up well.  None this year.  I have only had positive experiences working with UITS. I have submitted two tickets and they resolved them in a timely manner. Very helpful!  If I ever had issues or questions with the printer the UITS staff have always been able to resolve my issue.  In the past, I had issues with connecting to the internet and the UITS was great in helping out with this. However, the only recommendation I would make is questions or concerns are not always answered when you need them to be. I am also understanding that they are probably helping out several others as well, though. Responses sometimes just seem delayed.  So far so good, you guys have been doing wonderful especially for incoming students like me.  Fix the canvas phone app.  Before school started, I was having troubles with canvas, and when I called the IT support line, they were very helpful, kind, and understanding!  At the moment I do not have any thoughts or concerns to share. Positive experiences are that staff are always nice and seem to represent their position responsibly. I didn't notice any sort of hesitation to help or answer questions and have always seemed to feel welcome if I were to have any questions.  I have not had many experiences with UITS staff.  I haven't used or have needed to use this service...yet... I'm not sure if I just missed something when I first transferred to IUPUI but I felt like I was just kind of thrown in, which is normal--ya but maybe if there was an orientation (similar to the transfer Tuesday online seminar) that was about the technology at IUPUI and how to use/create/manage all of the different accounts (and the accounts you need to create) on One.iu and canvas/email...  I have received help when my computer locked me out and I forgot my password. They were very helpful.  The UITS staff is very quick to respond to any technical problems I have; either on campus or off.  The secure Wi-Fi always disconnects from my Mac book and switches to the public Wi-Fi.  I have gone to UITS multiple times. Not one interaction was negative.  I think the uits staff is great and any problems I have they usually solve it pretty fast.  I cannot say that in my time at IUPUI I had a bad experience with any service provided by UITS staff or services.  Just faster internet.  I have interacted with UITS staff when activating my U2F Token. They were very helpful and made the process easy for me and explained how to use it well.  I have not received any negative interactions with staff.  The second floor of the business/Kelley area doesn't have enough outlets in student study areas.  The printer in North Hall is awful. It rarely works properly and there aren't enough computers in North Hall.  My mom used to work there and she helps with a lot of this stuff for me. She asks uits for help if she can't figure it out. However, we realized many pages need updated in the knowledge base.  The Wi-Fi is slow.  Improvement of the existing one is fine and it will be okay.  Wi-Fi always cuts off. All The one.iu pages looks like a 5 year old coded it with no professionalism and difficult navigation. I pay tuition, I might as well get nicely upgraded school webpages. Go to the student center in one.iu and you will see what I mean by how sloppy it looks. Even smaller less profitable universities I've gone to have had way nicer, more user friendly navigation. I just hate when the school does what's in favor for them when I'm the student paying the big bucks to go here. Listen to us for one time. Thanks.  I have not had any negative experiences. It is my first semester on campus, and the staff at the testing center were very helpful and made the process much easier for me.  More available software and programs on IUware and IUanyware would be nice.  In my opinion, the university is providing good help and technology for the students.  I like the fact that you guys are relatively timely in delivering services based on the experience I have had.  Everything has been positive so far!  The staff is always so helpful and understanding. I have been able to work through a few technology issues easily with the help of staff. I really like canvas and one.iu. I think they are very effective.  I feel like it takes too much time to print. I think it would be more beneficial for computers to be able to scan our cards to login as it takes too much time and some professors tend to alter notes last minute which results in wasted prints (about 30 prints) and late to class.  I've had no complaints. I've noticed that even when a issue occurs with the printers it gets solved within a few hours or a day at the most which shows a lot.  At the start of spring semester 2019, my laptop began automatically connecting to IU DeviceNet. Not really an issue, but weird that I now have to manually connect to IU Secure.  The iu one website can be very confusing at times. Trying to find out your financial aid information, and seeing your money information clicking through many tabs and pages that don't have the information I need. I think it would be wise to make the site simpler or more organized so that people don't have this experience. I am not the only that thinks this.  Great experience.  For tophat, on the phone, when the instructor pauses a question there's a huge cancel sign that blocks the question from being read on the phone.  I've had exclusively good experiences. They helped me out with some duo issues once and have been very helpful when my professors needed assistance.  I don't really have any concerns or experiences with the UITS staff or services.  Not real concerns or negative interactions from the UITS. They have been really helpful and fast when needed.  I have not had any negative interactions.  Send less unnecessary emails.  I have had positive interactions with UITS.  Wi-Fi is slow.  The only thing worth mentioning is that the Wi-Fi occasionally doesn't work well. Everything else has been pretty good.  For the love of god, let me use my own router in my dorm.  Better Wi-Fi in the buildings. If I'm in the basement of the IT building I can hardly get signal, and then it's really slow.  The UITS people in the campus center at IUPUI always help me when I need it and know all the answers to my questions!  The staff has always been really prompt to come out to a classroom where we were having technical difficulties and were really efficient to help me with Duo issues.  I find it difficult that sometimes the internet connection is slow and it is hard for me to do my work.  No concerns  I have only good thoughts about UITS. They have been helpful to me all year long.  I have not had many interactions with UITS staff but did have one encounter [IRD]. A representative emailed the professor, and her supervisor and I got \"slapped\" on the hands about taking my issues (which were never resolved) up another level. In other words, I went to tech support for help who sent me back to the professor, who sent me back to tech support. Frustrating that they could not figure out the problem and I was reprimanded.  I have contacted them a few times over the course of my time here at Iupui. I have had only positive experiences. They are kind and always get to the solution.  I've needed help recovering a password for my adobe account, and set up two factor authentication.  All interactions with UITS staff have been positive. I haven't had many interactions with the staff, but they are always helpful when I need to reach out them. The only recommendation I can think of is updating the student service pages (bursar, transcript, adding/dropping classes). Mainstream the page and make it more simple to use. It has poor navigation functionality (can't easily go from page to page and hard to find where some items are.) My first degree was completed at [IRD] and their self service page was awesome and very easy to use.  I strongly dislike the disconnect of the services at random times without notification before or after an issue.  I've only asked for UITS assistance once, and they helped me set up my duo code. They were pleasant to work with.  The staff and services have been helpful throughout my college career. I'm thankful for the help they have provided over the years.  They are quick to fix any technological issues very effectively.  I have not interacted with UITS in the past.  Great feedback!  I don't have any negative comments at this time.  I think trying to incorporate signal into the basements of the buildings for phones so students can access their accounts using DUO on there phone. I can't participate in activities sometimes due to not being able to receive the notification on my phone to okay access into my accounts.  UITS has been very helpful, even when I just call over the phone!  Helpful, even though we did not solve my issue. They worked hard and were easy to follow up with. Also very polite.  They have been very helpful.  The services are pretty good but maybe you should do something about how to use canvas for the new students.  I have barely had any interactions with UITS except my first week on campus and they were helpful.   ### Graduate responses:  I received help with an issue I was having on my mac regarding my VPN software. All staff involved was very helpful.  It would be helpful to learn more about all of the services when you start rather than having to discover them as time goes by.  We have an IT person come at the beginning of each of our exams (we take them on our personal laptops) and it is always comforting to have someone there just in case anything goes wrong.  I have used the online chat and had positive experiences. I have only had positive experiences with technology at IUPUI.  I had an issue migrating my old and new email accounts when starting school in the fall and they were extremely helpful and got my issue fixed quickly.  All of my experiences have been either good or not memorable, which is a good thing when it comes to tech help! I usually only remember the bad experiences because they are so frustrating, but I haven't had many of those through IU. Most of my bad experiences have just been because of the tech itself, not because of the people helping me navigate them.  Indianapolis campus IT set up my duo token quickly and efficiently. As a medical student, we test in computer labs that often have issues. An IT staffer is always on hand and does his best to keep things running, but the computers still often fail.  The school website one.iu and the knowledge base website are not user friendly. It's like an attempt was made to make things easy to find but it just made everything harder to locate and get things done.  I am a grad student working on a Master of [IRD]. I am very interested in digital humanities.  I do a lot of programming in Python, if there was one thing that I really wish UITS would offer, it would be some sort of virtual private server for student projects. I have been messing around with many different applications, including Web frameworks like Flask and Django, RDBMS software like PostgreSQL, and data stores/search engines like ElasticSearch, Apache Solr and Jena. It would be cool if the university offered some sort of VPS or cloud computing because I would rather not use Azure or AWS--I trust and support IU much more than Microsoft or Amazon!!  Another thing that would be cool is if there were workshops for students who are not from the traditional math/science/engineering areas to learn how to use some of the more advanced computing tools. For instance, I do not know how to use git very well and it would be cool if there was a workshop about version control--it's hard to teach yourself everything from online tutorials and books. I don't know if there's much community stuff that goes on, but I would probably participate if I knew about it.  I mainly use GNU/Linux and I feel that it is pretty well supported, so I applaud that. It would be cool if some of the workstations on campus could boot into Ubuntu or Debian or something. I am using Emacs Org-Mode to write an annotated bibliography, and it would be great if I could install Emacs on my workstation at the [IRD], where I work. I guess I will call UITS or something to see if that can happen.  At the [IRD] and we have a lot of problems with the printers. I don't know why the undergraduates have to print so much, but it seems like the printers are always having some problem.  Many of the computers at IUPUI (particularly in the medical school buildings) seem to be aging and running slowly- perhaps unsurprising as they appear to be the same models I used as a freshman in Bloomington nearly 7 years ago. Running student organization events at the medical school, I have been very grateful for the IT support in getting presentations recorded and posted online.  Positive: the UITS staffs are skilled, competent and responsive. I enjoy the IT-related services across campus.  Negative: There seems to be many sub-divisions of functioning departments under UITS and there seems not to be a good inter-sub-division communication and/or information sharing. One such experience that I had was that I was trying to contact UITS for some issues related to the computer lab in an on-campus apartment, but I was told that they were not the right dept. to reach out to, subsequently I referred to contact another office, but I didn't find an appropriate contact information of my preference to reach out to that office. I went back to ask UITS for the contact information of the office again, but I didn't get a satisfactory answer. I understand that the services that UITS are able to provided cannot be inclusive of all students', faculty's and staffs' needs, but I didn't feel very supported through that experience.  As a campus I believe that the UITS staff has been very responsive. We have had many internet issues though. It seems as if it is never fixed. Every day it disconnects even if it's just for a second.  I have had good experiences with UITS staff when I have called/emailed asking for assistance for computer/university supported systems issues.  There are times when the support for the system that my school purchased and housed on an UITS server is not as responsive as I would like it to be.  I would also request that the IU Secure/Wireless internet access be looked at in the AD classrooms. I often teach on the [IRD] floor and have difficult accessing the internet which compromises some of my teaching.  The Linux staff that are available are really good, you just need more of them. Most techs arrive and respond quickly and I am glad we have such a good IT dept.  A couple of gripes:  The Box service that IU uses is awful. It's interface is clunky, It's sometimes slow to upload, and recently mysteriously did not upload complete folders, which almost caused a serious data loss issue. I have went back to using Google Drive, which is not large enough. Also, Box has no real Linux support, which seems crazy for a university.  I do not think it is appropriate for techs to be in labs by themselves with the door closed. Our lab has dangerous equipment and raw materials that are valuable (like gold, etc.), plus sensitive experimental setups here and there. One day I opened the door to our lab and a tech was in there working on a computer. I can think of no good reason to have the door closed. Although I do not believe the individual was up to no good, they could very well have gotten blamed for something they did not do, it's just not a good look. I think they should leave the door open and let someone know where they are at.  Holy cow, this survey is way to long. Many questions were not relevant and could have easily been bypassed with a question such as \"Do you use any teaching services,\" etc. A couple were either redundant or poorly worded.  I've had great experience. They respond fairly quickly either by phone or email.  Technology in classrooms often does not work - whether they be sound, projection/display problems, internet, etc.  Technology platforms are not generally user friendly to individuals who haven't used them before/are new to IU. If there is training on how to use it, it isn't well publicized.  The only concerns I have is that staff at the dental school who are designated to help with Axium problems often seem overworked and unavailable.  Love the online chat available when troubleshooting software issues. Also had great experience with UITS in my research laboratory where we regularly have licensing and/or hardware issues (usually printing).  I have had no interaction with UITS staff. I have utilized the UITS IUWare website to download various program, and am saddened that the Endnote9 version that is downloadable is only a trial version and I am not able to utilize it to it's fullest extent. If there was a way to get the full version, there is no information on the IUWare website with instructions or any instructions regarding how to transfer libraries when switching from Endnote8 to Endnote9.  Called to help setup email on my phone... quick and easy process...very helpful!  Bursar management could be improved...feels as though I have zero control over how my funds are distributed.  No comments at this time .  Any issues that I have had are always taken care of via email, so I have never met with a UITS support specialist. I think my biggest issue is feeling like my requests are being taken care of in a timely manner.  I have had multiple emails recently from \"UITS staff\" claiming that my account will be deactivated. I'm sure it's not true, but maybe sending out an email addressing this spam.  I am very impressed with the lecture recording systems in the classrooms - HOWEVER, many of the professors cannot seem to figure it out, so many lectures go unrecorded. Possibly a training program to get these professors more comfortable with the technology would be helpful. It was very frustrating when some professors used the system with ease and others just could not figure it out.  The training courses are probably my favorite thing about UITS; they're very well designed and cover a broad range of topics. I have also generally been pleased with the online chat support; it's prompt and helpful. The knowledge base is pretty useful.  Physical support with UITS tends to be disappointing. There is often no consultant in the labs at peak times or they are hard to find. Printing is also often unreliable: large print jobs just get lost in the server after I've been charged (and again no one around to help).  I thoroughly enjoy the technology IU offers students and have bragged about it to co-workers (at a local hospital) more specifically on how updates/ upgrades are handled. I would like to see Qualtrics being a free software like Office without having to download/pay for updated software every semester.  The printing services here need to be re-examined. Students are given a printing stipend but the printing is slow, I frequently get my account charged to print something then the printer fails. It's extremely frustrating. The Wi-Fi is also really spotty at times and consistency in that area needs to be improved.  UITS is always very knowledgeable and helpful.  The response time is really nice. I have always received responses within 12 hours which is commendable.  One interaction: I visited there with a laptop that had just become entirely unoperational. It was a time of mild panic, and although the UITS student staff on hand were unable to fix the problem (it was beyond fixing), they were very kind and attentive and gave me some good advice on next steps that resulted in me being able to save the majority of data that was on the laptop.  You guys do good work! (In my experience, at any rate)  Literally anything you do would be better than this. ANYTHING  No  So far the experience has been good. Especially, during the shift from umail to gmail.  The IT in the School of Medicine is wonderful!  I found most of the things positive with my experience with UITS staff. They are very concerned and cooperative. In my last semester, we had few issues in connecting to the server at the peak time of a project and for a few assignments. They solved these issues within no more than 3 days. Thank you for that.  I have had several workshops (both in person and online) in the past. While I enjoy in-person interaction more, I sometimes find it hard to arrange it (due to conflict with time and place, parking issues etc.). Some of these courses were excellent for my level (e.g. adv. excel, SAS, access) but some (even said introductory, e.g. supercomputing) were quite quick to pass my level. Also, some covered only a part of the topic and ended without going over the parts that are needed for general coverage (GIS, SQL for example). I certainly would like a slower paced course where questions can be asked, possibly with an online recording available for review afterward. R and Julia beside Python should be included. A deeper coverage of Bash would be of interest as well.  Some IU KB database need a more structural approach to find the information. But thanks for the info anyway.  The UITS staff is always very quick to respond and help with any technical issues, even those not related to in-class computers.  I have not had any interactions with UITS staff.  We get charged an obnoxious technology fee each semester yet, our technology is never updated. The printers and computers in the clinic space are atrocious. They are all well over 10 years old, which is absurd to expect us to be able to work on. Additionally, the IT staff seems to be unable to get v-drives to work among other things.  I have never interacted with UITS staff before  I have always had very prompt assistance from UITS whenever I have needed it!  I have not had any issues with technology services during my enrollment at IUPUI.  I'm not entirely sure what UITS encompasses; so it was difficult to accurately respond to the survey questions. I generally feel overwhelmed with the UITS website, which prevents me from taking advantage of UITS offerings.  I would recommend to have all mechanical softwares available at UITS. Hypermesh, Nastran, Siemens Nx. Must be included.  Rest no issues.  I have had nothing but positive experiences: access to useful software when I have to re-install things in my computer, responsive help desk when I call on the phone, nice people.  None  Our IT services is always available to help and any questions.  Graduate students pay higher tuition than undergraduate students, but they are not allocated any amount of free prints. Also, unused portions of prints for students should also be allowed to be carried over to the next year which would benefit students transitioning from undergraduate to graduate status.  I haven't really had any interactions with UITS staff, but I am pleased with the online applications that IU uses.  As an online student enrolled in a graduate program I have nothing but good things to say about my interactions over the past two years UITS. The courteous level of attention and time to resolution to any issues I have had has been stellar.  I used their online information to help set up IU email on my phone when I switched from iPhone to Android. I was able to get it figured out eventually, but maybe someone can look at these articles again and see if they can be simplified.  Out of date materials.  Everyone has been very responsive to my needs, and I love the access to top notch software.  This year, IT staff at IUSM-Gary has been helpful with computer-related issues.  Hilarious commercials.  Friendly, helpful staff that I've only interacted with once - great guy!  Email move over was terrible. I tried getting help on moving my emails since I file them all and they didn't transfer. I did the chat box and nothing worked. Finally my dad figured out how to move them.  None  Always helpful at quickly resetting passwords.  Sometimes it ask for security keys multiple times. I have issues while using Kuail time. Printing should not be charged to students as in other universties.  I have used the services only once and they were really helpful.  Speedy, efficient problem solving. Policies make sense. Responsive staff. I'm a fan.  Logging-on to university computers is a terribly slow and aggravating process. It needs to be improved.  N/A  I have only needed to call tech support a few times to work out any issues I had. Every time I have called I have had prompt support that offered guidance in addressing the concerns. I would like to suggest possibly combining Canvas with Sonia. As a graduate student, completing practicums having these two tools in one spot would be helpful.  I'm not a great user of UITS services, but when ever I used them I had a good experience.  The staff are always very responsive and timely in their responses. I have found the team to be very helpful. My computer is very old and slow, but I'm not sure that's IUTS's responsibility.  Canvas is great and helps a lot with learning. Many of the interfaces on one.iu.edu are a little difficult to access and not as user-friendly.  All of my classes are online so most of this survey doesn't pertain to me.  I have not extensively used UITS but during the course of 6 months at IU, UITS have helped me to setup the ACSEL lab and procurement. If UITS can give us a discreet session on the use of super comps, it will be easy for the grad students involved in heavy simulations to find a way out from those long sim times.  Everything up until now is good. Every time I need help, you helped me. So, I am satisfied. I may wish you have some others IT centers all through the campus, so that we can come, talk and solve the problems face to face in some cases.  The cabin spaces within UITS is a boon for all the students equally who have to do a lot of group works throughout their major. Graduate students like me use them regularly for the work. The only suggestion I have for UITS is that some graduate students need bigger whiteboards to discuss.  Overall positive, but the process for graduate students receiving money to print, and the process to print on campus, is confusing and not well explained  I'm finishing my Masters in Library and Information Science which is 100% online. I love the fact that I'm able to log onto an image of computers on campus to complete my assignments. I have a Chromebook and am not able to download Microsoft Office and other tools on my laptop.  However, some of the applications on the Legacy_IUPUI instance need to be upgraded e.g. Firefox in particular. I've have not heard of a number of services that UITS provides for remote students. It would be helpful if that information was available to new students as soon as they are enrolled or start a program of study. I would have used more of the research and statistical computing tools if I had been aware of them. At times, UITS offers training. I'd like to see any training, seminars, or talks that are scheduled on campus have the capability to be accessed off campus e.g. either live access using Zoom or other technology or the ability to review a recording of the training after the fact.  I do have a recommendation for the future. I highly recommend that the university install some electrical vehicle charging station in those parking garages.  I have three reasons to support my proposal. First, the Blue Indy charging stations on the street is not a rational EV charging solution for us. According to their technician, their stations only provide 210V and 16A, which equals to 3.36 kWh. For a standard EV which has 75 kWh battery capacity, it will take about 22 hours to gain full charge. The charging and parking fee is $2 per hour. Thus, we need to pay $44 to gain 300 miles, which is even much higher than fill up a normal gasoline vehicle. As a student of IUPUI, we must buy an annual or monthly parking permit in particular parking areas rather than the expensive street parking. Second, based on the recent tendency, some authorities predict that there will be 25% vehicles on the road will be EVs. Consequently, the campus will require more and more charging stations sooner or later. Third, the cost a level 2 charging station is only $500. But it will bring numerous benefits including constructing environmental friendly campus, improving working and studying environment, facilitating the normal life of students and faculties etc. Therefore, it is quite beneficial to install some charging station on the campus.  Canvas was down, the system was experiencing an outage and I wanted information. The tech I had contact with was friendly, responsive, and informative.  Good service and helpful staff.  Some of the printers in buildings such as the Technology building are a little difficult to use. Clearer instructions about how to print out a file on my laptop would be helpful.  As far as I can recall, I have always have positive experiences with UITS staff and services. I like the UITS Monitor newsletter. I skim that almost every time I receive it and often find interesting tidbits of helpful info.  I have gained a lot of knowledge about our IU servers whenever I encountered problems. But, when I tried to get some printer issues, it was hard to get help immediately.  Staff has always been extremely responsive and helpful.  I have not had any negative interactions. The few times I have asked questions, I received emails quickly.  All staff and support are great!  UITS has always been very helpful to me and my students. My students have been able to call 24 hours a day for assistance and this is \"golden\" for them and me.  Good email responses to tech issues.  Hits is very helpful, staff is nice and patient.  I have always had positive experiences with UITS staff when having basic canvas issues or issues with IU anyware, etc.  I have always had great experiences with IT staff. The only change I would like to see would be the accessibility to printing services. Currently we are restricted to 100 free pages and that is too low.  The IT staff in my department have been wonderfully responsive and in addition to providing remote help, have even come in person when needed to set up and explain changes.  Never had a bad experience with the staff.  Always answer my calls and are patient to help me through the issue.  Overall your UITS is pretty good.  The UITS staff are well versed and knowledgeable about how to solve almost any task related to technology. I always visit the help desk in the Campus Center.  I think UITS should provide better tutorials on how to use cluster computer environments and job submission. Additionally, duo mobile is very annoying. I have to do duo sign in at least 30 times a day because every time I log into a computing cluster or have to transfer files have to use duo mobile.  Please allow once a day duo sign in for carbonate, bigred2, and karst.  They helped me get access to Cerner and work EndNote.  I recommend going back to OnCourse. Canvas is trash, and none of my professors know how to use it. Half of them use proprietary course-management software from things like lexis or westlaw. IU spent a decade developing OnCourse just to jump ship when it was finally running smoothly.  Also, duo two-factor authentication is TRASH. if somebody wants to hack my account and pay my loans or read my 10000 listserv emails from IU, let 'em.  I've always had a positive experience when working with UITS staff whether for technological issues or questions.  The UITS has been doing a great job providing their services to students.  No  Most, if not all, of my dealings with UITS have been outstanding. It's easier when I can deal directly with staff located here on this campus, instead of being routed when I call for assistance to Bloomington first. That's too far from where I am.  The only issue I have is that the internet doesn't work every so often in the buildings I have class in, which can make it difficult to download lecture notes ahead of time.  I've had good experience with UITS staff who were able to answer my questions quickly. I am not fully aware of all of the technology support services and unsure about how to learn about them.  UITS staff has always been helpful to me in the past. I have only had minor trouble such as email and other logistical things.  There are significant connectivity issues in the dental school when students use the electronic health record (Axium) from their personal device. They frequently lose connectivity when moving from room to room.  Less steps to open email, canvas and the outlook app.  When an issue arises on the hospital computers during clinical rotations, it is not clear whether I need to talk to UITS or to Cerner/hospital IT services.  They are willing to help and have always had solution for my problems. I have had the same constant problem with the program I use at school.  I have had no interaction with UITS.  IUAnyWare times out of Citrix much too fast and does not allow the user to walk away from something like an SAS workspace even long enough to use the restroom. It can be infuriating to work through IUAnyWare because it constantly requires logging in repeatedly. We all continue to use it because SAS licenses are expensive. Otherwise, I would have my own and never use Citrix again.  I was directed to the correct individual to solve my issue and the person who helped me, Bhavya, was very helpful and even sent a follow-up to ensure that my issue was resolved. The supercomputers are great and relatively easy to use and as long as I stat with the debug queue normally the jobs run quickly.  I don't like that I have to re-sign in on EVERY device EVERY time even though I have selected 'remember for 7 days.'  The duo is obnoxious to log into. Especially when I'm on campus and need to log in but my phone is dead from working a 12 hour shift. Then I cannot access what I need to.  I have not had a lot of interaction with UITS directly and I don't have any negative experiences from those limited interactions. I am happy with how easy I can navigate and find what I need on my own without requiring the direct interaction with UITS personnel.  My experience with IUTS is overall positive. Staff have responded promptly when I have expressed concerns, and the technology services available throughout campus are ample and sufficient for my needs.  I've had great experiences with both the UITS staff and services!  UITS has been very responsive every time I needed help with technical difficulties!  I haven't had any recent trouble where I needed to contact UITS, but when I did in the past they were great.  Every time I have reached out (which is not that often) it has gone well. I like that someone can get on my screen remotely and help out.  I had a very positive experience. My problem was addressed very quickly. I had issues with KALTURA video recordings.  Zoom recordings work good, but you need help to do it. Instructions on it not clear.  I have had a great experience with UITS. There was a bit of a problem with getting remote access but that was sorted out very promptly by UITS.  It would be nice if we had a UITS member close to the medical school campus.  The cellphone signal in my lab is pretty bad. Also, it doesn't help that my phone keeps on getting disconnected from the IU secure Wi-Fi.  No concerns or negative reactions.  No comments at this time.  Kaltura is difficult to search - I have correctly typed professor's names to find videos I know they've posted and they do not turn up in the search results.  I find One.IU confusing and I don't always know where to look for the services I need, especially regarding loans and payments.  I am already at 90% of my OneDrive storage, which I use exclusively to store school materials. Possible solutions: tips on how to decrease the data I use or increase available space (that could be expensive). Also, will I have access to my information in my Drive after I graduate?  They've been extraordinarily helpful. I realized I don't have a good understanding of what research resources are available and would love to have a run down of what's available.  I have not had any direct experiences with the UITS staff. So far, my use of the technology platforms has been flawless. "

    "body": "  ## 2019 UITS User Survey Summary IU Bloomington (IUB)   ### Brief guide to understanding the data  The UITS User Survey is administered by the Center for Survey Research. Surveys were sent to 12,199 randomly selected people at Indiana University Bloomington (780 Faculty, 1,555 Staff, 7,909 Undergraduate students, 1,955 Graduate students). Please note that respondents who reported in the first question of the survey that they did not use UITS systems or services were not asked any additional questions and were removed from the results presented here.  The questions on the survey are primarily Likert opinion scales (1-5 rating scales with 5 being the most favorable rating). Responses to open-ended questions (for example, Question 9, see the survey questionnaire [INSERT LINK]) are not presented here. The results include:  For the average opinion and the satisfaction (helpfulness, importance, awareness, and agreement) scores , confidence intervals are provided. The confidence intervals indicate the sampling error for each estimate at the 95% confidence level. Average opinion and satisfaction (helpfulness, importance, awareness, and agreement) scores and their associated confidence intervals are not reported if they are based on fewer than 25 respondents. For categorical response questions that do not involve ratings such as whether the student lives in University housing or how often computing problems prevent accomplishing daily work, data are not reported for the full question if they are based on fewer than 25 respondents and data are not reported for a particular category if at least one (1) but fewer than five (5) respondents selected the category. Data that are not reported are indicated by “N/A”. “Not Applicable/Do Not Use” responses were removed prior to the calculation of estimates, except for usage rates. Missing data and “Unsure” responses were excluded from estimates as well.  This summary includes data from 1,511 people who participated in the survey (182 Faculty, 576 Staff, 526 Undergraduate students, 227 Graduate students). Results were weighted to reflect the total counts of faculty, staff, undergraduate students, and graduate students at IUB in the fall of 2018. This helps to correct for overrepresentation of some subpopulations (for example, staff) and underrepresentation of others (for example, students) among those who chose to respond to the survey by bringing their representation in line with the total counts in the overall IUB population. Sampling error estimates account for weighting of the data.  It is important to note that some services are used only by certain subpopulations, so results are shown for the appropriate subpopulations. Subpopulations are indicated by FAC for faculty, STF for staff, GRD for graduate students, and UND for undergraduate students. In some cases, the scores are for groups of subpopulations, indicated for example by [GRD, UND] for services used by graduate and undergraduate students. Results are shown separately for multiple subpopulations where appropriate.  For detail on the study methodology, please see [INSERT LINK].   ### General Services  1.

    "body": "  ## 2019 IUPUC User Survey – Methods Summary  UITS at Indiana University contracts with the IU Center for Survey Research (CSR) each year to conduct an annual survey aimed at assessing current usage, awareness, and levels of satisfaction with UITS services.   ### Population and Sample:  The target population for the 2019 UITS User Survey is all current IUPUC faculty, staff, undergraduate, and graduate students. A random sample of 25% of each subpopulation was drawn from IU administrative databases. The university databases should be highly accurate and complete in providing coverage of the target population. The 2019 UITS User Survey was administered as a web survey and distributed via email invitation on January 29, 2019 to 376 randomly selected people at IUPUC (39 Faculty, 17 Staff, 302 Undergraduate students, 18 Graduate students).   ### Questionnaire and Data Collection:  The survey questions were developed by UITS. They ask about usage of email, devices, and services, as well as satisfaction with various tools and services available to the campus. The questions on the survey are primarily Likert opinion scales (1-5 rating scales with 5 always being the most favorable rating). Most questions include an “N/A” or “Do not use” response option. The survey was programmed in Qualtrics and thoroughly tested by CSR and UITS staff. The survey was administered in English only.  The field period for the 2019 UITS User Survey was January 29, 2019 through March 19, 2019. An invitation and five reminders were sent by email to maximize participation. As an incentive for participation, survey participants were entered into a drawing for one of five $100 cash prizes (drawn from all IUPUC and IUPUI participants).   ### Final Dispositions and Response Rates:  Table 1 below indicates the population and sample size (the number of surveys originally sent out to the randomly selected individuals), the number of actual responses, and the percentage of responses received by subpopulation. Population sizes were obtained from University Institutional Research and Reporting. A questionnaire was categorized as a respondent if at least three questions were answered.  Final dispositions for all cases were classified according to The American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR). 2016. Standard Definitions: Final Dispositions of Case Codes and Outcome Rates for Surveys. 9th edition. Table 2 itemizes final dispositions and the AAPOR Response Rate, RR2.  AAPOR Response Rate 2 is calculated using the following formula:  \\(RR2 = {(I+P) \\over (I+P) + (R+NC+O) + (UH+UO)}\\)  AAPOR Response Rate 2  16.0%   ## Weights:  Results were weighted to reflect the total counts of those employed by the university (Faculty and Staff, combined) and students (Undergraduate and Graduate students, combined) at IUPUC in the fall of 2018 (shown in Table 1). Since there were fewer than 20 respondents in the faculty and staff subpopulations, faculty and staff were combined for weighting purposes. Similarly, since there were fewer than 20 respondents in the graduate student subpopulation, graduate and undergraduate students were combined for weighting purposes. Weighting helps to correct for overrepresentation of some subpopulations (for example, staff) and underrepresentation of others (for example, students) among those who chose to respond to the survey by bringing their representation in line with the total counts in the overall IUPUC population. More specifically, the weights were defined as the number in the population divided by the number of respondents for each combined subpopulation (employees, students). For example, for employee respondents (included faculty and staff), their weight was (175+90)/(11+10)=12.6.  All estimates presented in the summary of results and in Tableau have been weighted. Sampling error estimates account for weighting of the data.  For additional information or questions about administration of the survey, please contact csr@indiana.edu . "

    "body": "  ## 2021 UITS User Survey Summary IU-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI)   ### Brief guide to understanding the data  The UITS User Survey is administered by the Center for Survey Research. Surveys were sent to 8,089 randomly selected people at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (897 Faculty, 1,147 Staff, 4,095 Undergraduate students, 1,950 Graduate students). Please note that respondents who reported that they did not use UITS systems or services (see Question 1) were not asked any additional questions and were removed from the results presented here.  The questions on the survey are primarily Likert opinion scales (1-5 rating scales with 5 being the most favorable rating). Responses to open-ended questions are not presented here. The results include:  For the average opinion and the satisfaction/importance/agreement scores, confidence intervals are provided. The confidence intervals indicate the sampling error for each estimate at the 95% confidence level. Average opinion and satisfaction/importance/agreement scores and their associated confidence intervals are not reported if they are based on fewer than 25 respondents. For categorical response questions that do not involve ratings such as whether the student lives in University housing or preferred method(s) of communications from UITS, data are not reported for the full question if they are based on fewer than 25 respondents and data are not reported for a particular category if at least one (1) but fewer than five (5) respondents selected the category. Data that are not reported are indicated by “N/A”. “Not Applicable/Do Not Use” responses were removed prior to the calculation of estimates, except for usage rates. Missing data were excluded from estimates as well.  This summary includes data from 1,035 people who participated in the survey (167 Faculty, 371 Staff, 289 Undergraduate students, 208 Graduate students). Results were weighted to reflect the total counts of faculty, staff, undergraduate students, and graduate students at IUPUI in the fall of 2020. This helps to correct for overrepresentation of some subpopulations (for example, staff) and underrepresentation of others (for example, students) among those who chose to respond to the survey by bringing their representation in line with the total counts in the overall IUPUI population. Sampling error estimates account for weighting of the data.  It is important to note that some services are only used by specific subpopulations, so questions were only asked to those groups. Subpopulations of users are indicated by FAC for faculty, STF for staff, GRD for graduate students, and UND for undergraduate students. Additionally, there were questions specific to campus subpopulations. These are indicated by IUB for the Indiana University Bloomington campus and IUPUI for the Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis campus.   ### General Services  1.

    "body": "## 2019 UITS User Survey IU Bloomington (IUB) – Open Text Responses (Edited)  This text file includes responses to the following question of the UITS survey:  (At start of the survey): As you get started, please take a moment to share with us any thoughts, concerns, issues, and/or ideas that you may have. What positive experiences with UITS staff or services have you had? Are there concerns or negative interactions that you want us to know about? Do you have recommendations for new services or improvements to existing ones? (You will have a chance to review, amend, or add to your comments before submitting your responses.)  (At end of the survey): If you entered comments at the beginning of the survey, they are displayed below. If you would like to edit your comments, share recommendations for additional services and support resources, or add additional comments or suggestions please enter them below.  Identifying references have been removed from this document and replaced with “[IRD]”. Responses are grouped by sample: Faculty, Staff, Undergraduate students, and Graduate students.   ### Faculty responses:  UITS has been great. Always very helpful and if they don't know the answer right away, they will figure it out. I also really appreciate the extended walk-in hours in Wells Library.  I am able to obtain help with Canvas and IT-related matters easily, problems are usually resolved through a phone call.  No negative interactions.  UITS staff continue to expect faculty/staff to know all about IT. Instructions/communications/Knowledge base are essentially impenetrable, and often incorrect.  The \"IU secure\" Wi-Fi network seems not stable on my iPhone Xr. Sometimes I cannot open websites though the Wi-Fi is connected.  I have found UITS to be very helpful when I have used their services.  In the recent past, I have called UITS regarding Canvas and its integrated tools (e.g., VoiceThread, Piazza, Quick Check), Microsoft Outlook and Google@IU, and my office computer. For the most part, I have not received an adequate solution from UITS staff. The staff member usually: (1) sends me a link to a support article that I have already read, (2) tells me they'll look into it and doesn't follow up adequately, or (3) figures out a solution after I do. It is possible that my questions are beyond the expertise of the staff member and/or the system wasn't designed to accommodate what I want to do. However, there should be a smooth process to get my concerns to the right people and resolve them or to begin to work towards a good solution.  UITS staff has been knowledgeable and quick to respond  I regularly used RED resource. I had contacted UITS staff many times always with a satisfactory and fruitful interaction.  Matt Link has been very supportive of research needs.  IU needs to address a remaining issue with its mass email policy. Any mass email needs to explain why or in what role someone is getting the email. For instance, \"You are getting this email because you are an '[assistant, associate, full] professor at IU.\" Or, \"You are getting this email because of your administrative support role at IU.\" This will let people know if all faculty are getting this email, or if they are supposed to pass it on.  The staff has been good, although the help desk is a bit of hit or miss. However, UITS has significantly downgraded several teaching services that we had access to in the past, making it much more difficult to teach technology-related courses.  Our Jacobs School of Music staff 'does more with less' every day--I'm grateful. In my encounters with IU UITS staff, I've always had pleasant experience--and pleasant outcomes.  I am a faculty member with a desktop computer in my office on campus. This computer is owned by the university but assigned exclusively to me--no one else uses it except me. And yet every time I want to EVEN UPDATE SOFTWARE I have to schedule an appointment with someone to remotely type in a stupid administrator password to let me install the update. This is RIDICULOUS. I can't even count the number of productive hours I have lost waiting for someone to return my calls and emails to set up an appointment for later that day (or even another day!) to do nothing more than type in a password. This is infantilizing, frustrating, and a waste of my time. I'm sure it serves some sort of security purpose, but I beg you: FIND ANOTHER WAY TO MAKE THE COMPUTERS SECURE. I should be able to install a stupid Dropbox update WITHOUT WAITING HALF A DAY FOR YOUR HELP. And please don't assume that improving response times from the CITO staff is the answer--just give us more freaking autonomy! This is the only university I have ever worked at that has exercised this level of control over faculty computing. Find another way.  The technology in Ballantine has been disrupted by the construction. This needs to be addressed. Internet service was not working at all the first day of classes this semester.  Support staff need to get to the classrooms faster when there is a problem. I've had whole class periods wasted because no one showed up early enough to make things work.  The information on kb.iu.edu is great!  They helped me set up my phone.  The website has information I've found useful.  \"Cloud\" storage to back up data EASILY is still my biggest wish. Doing large backups to Box has proved highly problematic. I admit I haven't tried One Drive yet so I have hopes that will work, but I also hope UITS continues to work on this.  Otherwise, know that we appreciate all of you!!  In general, my experiences with UITS have been positive. CITO takes care of most of our day-to-day concerns and we have excellent experiences with them. The tasks we address with UITS are often of a broader scope, addressing technical needs with more of a long-term nature.  Generally, UITS staff has been a pleasure to work with. I have only had a few IT-related problems in my (short) time at IUB but, each time the team associated with my department has been quick to respond and the issue has always been promptly resolved.  I have no complaints. Everything is predictable and works as it should. I did have some trouble trying to move to the iu.edu email address. The change seemed very cumbersome and I ended up abandoning it after all.  UITS has been helpful with my general questions and they are normally pretty quick too. It would be nice if they had a division that could help with more complex things. I have previously tried to download a program from source and there was nobody on campus who could help.  Help line is great.  Not that I can think.  Staff are very helpful. No problems there.  Three recurring IT issues:  (I) The office telephones on campus should be independent of the computer being on. If my office computer is sleeping, I cannot be contacted and I cannot make emergency calls. This is both inefficient and a security issue.  (ii) Some smartrooms no longer have an independent telephone. All classes should have a phone. (For when the computer doesn't work, for when there is a medical emergency. One of my students actually had a grand mal seizure - no phone - had to borrow a student's phone).  (ii) The current agreement with Adobe is that only two devices can be used with the software. As I access files from my office computer, my home desktop, my laptop, and my phone, this means I am constantly being signed out of Adobe and have to sign back in to read pdfs. This IU-Adobe agreement is insane. There was no problem was Adobe was downloadable. Can the university not renegotiate a more sensible arrangement? Thanks!  I have no negative comments or experiences with UITS.  In general, I am very happy with our IT services, especially the way you handle security. I am not so happy with the way IU micromanages (at least on my desktop PC) the use of programs like Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Acrobat. I am using both programs a lot, but the upgrades are cumbersome and add unnecessary jingles and bells. I was content with an earlier version of Adobe Illustrator on CDs (which I had purchased through IU), but I am not allowed to use that program. The latest version of Adobe Acrobat takes 20 minutes (twenty minutes!) to open its screen on my desktop PC. My departmental IT staff cannot fix this problem, which may be caused by incompatibility of Adobe upgrades with Microsoft upgrades. I have an IU-issued 3-year old laptop where I have all privileges and run programs without any problem, including Adobe Acrobat. My departmental IT group wanted me to turn that laptop in for reformatting of the hard drive according to latest regulations (thus restricting my privileges). Fat chance! Recently I visited the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna and used a fancy scanning device to look for malware on all my flash drives that I use in conjunction with my laptop during travels. No malware was detected. I am confident that I am quite careful protecting my laptop and desktop from malware.  I rely on UITS on a 24/7 basis. I have had patient, informed support through this. Recently, I've wondered if this service has been given to other vendors to respond to - a couple of times, it just hasn't been so patient and informed.  Very positive experience getting switches/router added to a building. Everyone was helpful through the holiday season and beyond to make sure the right technology was purchased and installed.  I have had nothing but positive interactions with UITS.  My calls to the UITS helpline are usually very productive; that service works well, and is appreciated!  The university IT systems that one must actually use, however, are disastrous. It is never easy to find the information or online form that's needed -- and I usually have to make 3 or 4 phone calls to find someone who knows how to do something that used to involve a simple typed or handwritten note, or who knows where to find a policy that used to be in the printed bulletin. Additionally, systems are changed all the time without notice to faculty, so knowing how to accomplish a task one semester could be useless information six months in the future. University IT systems make formerly simple and quick tasks into long, arduous, confusing slogs. IU really need to reconsider its entire IT systems philosophy, because it has made my job more difficult and more troublesome, instead of easing the workload as technology is supposed to do.  Jeff Taylor, who is the Manager of Computer Support Services in the math department, is very helpful and fast.  I've had technicians help set up my hybrid course and I often do a walk-in at the library.  I've had very positive interactions, especially related to scientific computing support. Keep it up! Some classrooms sorely need hardware upgrades both lecture hall computers and computing classrooms (especially in the Geology building).  Poor communication and on-boarding strategies to introduce new technologies and improvement of existing ones.  Our group worked with Joe Butler and Therese Miller this past year to push a stagnant project forward. We are ever so grateful for their involvement and assistance. They helped to resolve several technical issues and brought their technical expertise to the table. Regan Fields was also very helpful by attending weekly meetings by teleconference. She could notify us of available resources and options for solving problems. These colleagues were instrumental to our progress on the project.  I mostly have positive experiences. I could use more Canvas support; it seems like UITS doesn't think Canvas is in their jurisdiction. Kaltura recordings are cumbersome to share with a class. Document cameras are frequently not working in classrooms. Canvas quizzes are very difficult to use (for example, so far as I know, it can't be spell checked except on a question by question, answer by answer basis).  I am generally happy with UITS.  If the call help center is part of UITS, I have had nothing but positive interactions with them; otherwise, I enjoy reading the UITS newsletter as my only other continuous contact with UITS.  Always been very helpful  Great service.  I've been very pleased with the help I've gotten with Canvas. I've emailed the UITs team twice with questions regarding Canvas and both were answered promptly and helpfully.  Post-survey comment: I was not aware of several services, like Teaching.IU, that I think may be helpful to me until I took this survey! In general, it would be nice to have departments direct new employees to ALL available computing/teaching/etc. resources in some sort of new employee introduction.  My experience with the UITS has been positive.  My role at the university is dedicated to teaching and most of that takes place in the STC Labs. I've always had great experiences with any support & interactions with staff in the labs. My biggest concern is with the lab hardware. Over the last year or so, in teaching in BH118 and LI402 it is normal to have several PC's broken on any given day. In BH118 last fall (FA18) I had to reschedule quizzes for several students because there were not enough PC's operable in the room.  Also, though better recently, I have experienced a lot of crashes and sluggish performance with Outlook. While it is overall better on Campus, when I'm on Outlook off campus it is prone to crashes and slow performance. My connectivity at home is very good (Smithville fiber optic, generally 100+ mb/s download).  I have generally had very positive interactions with UITS. They offer a lot of great services. I do have some gripes about some services available through one.iu.edu. They sometimes perform in really unexpected ways. I had a problem with \"view your paycheck\" this past year, and I worked it out with UITS help, but the defaults were set in such a way that it displayed nothing.  I like the helpline.  I find Canvas difficult (not very intuitive) to use, organized poorly, lacking certain features like easy to use blogger, etc.  UITS staff are generally very good, but often inexperienced. CITO staff are terrible.  Most of my interactions with UITS are positive. Especially the people who are responsible for the compute clusters. They are always willing to help when we run into problems, even if they don't always find solutions for our problems.  I have had excellent experiences:  (1)        IUTS at the library has helped me with many different problems from CANVAS to software issues  (2)        The testing center provided prompt and accurate scoring  (3)        The IUTS in the SPH has provided me with prompt, useful support. They seem to be able to solve any problem.  (4)        My main criticism is Kaltura and Canvas, both difficult to use for faculty and wasted a lot of time  The information technology environment on our campus has been excellent and been very helpful in my teaching activities. I use UITS facilities and services and I have been working with some of the staff members of UITS. They are knowledgeable and friendly so my experience with UITS is very satisfactory.  I have had almost entirely good experiences with UITS. The response has usually been very rapid and has almost always resulted in my problem being solved. All of my issues had to with desktop computing using a Mac. Only on one occasion have I been frustrated by a computer issue that had to do with Windows XP connecting to the internet. We had a computer running XP controlling experimental equipment that needed such connection which became forbidden under IU policy. I no longer remember the details because this happened several years ago. The whole research program had to be shut down. To put it mildly I was very angry that no other solution was offered.  NA  Love the call in number! Always get great advice and help.  My overall experience has been excellent. Every now and then, though, when I call UITS, I get someone who doesn't know the answer to my question but insists that he will figure it out if I am only patient. Occasionally the person will offer several suggestions that don't work, but will refuse to ask for assistance from a supervisor, even after he has kept me on the line for a long time. I realize I could simply hang up and call again, hoping someone else will answer my call, but that seems rude. There seems to be something of a culture or norm at UITS deterring your consultants from asking for help when they need it. It would be great if that culture could be changed.  I am an adjunct faculty member and have taught the same law school class for 10+ years. I post my syllabus on Canvas and use some classroom technology that I sometimes need assistance with from the law school IT folks. Otherwise I don't use/need most of the UITS services, but only because they are not necessary to what I do.  The frustrating:  The good:  POST-SURVEY CLARIFICATIONS:  Generally good experience.  None  The UITS staff were extremely helpful, there was not a single negative interaction during our communication. In fact, they answered all the questions I had with patience. They were also very willing to explain in detail.  My primary concerns are with the IU website, in particular the School of Medicine website. The IUSM website is terribly difficult to navigate even for us that are part of IU. For those outside of IU, the IUSM website is really difficult to find anything you are looking for with annoying menus always dropping in, extravagantly long web addresses, and the structure of the site is not user friendly either. In addition, the staff in charge of the IUSM website are extremely difficult to deal with.  The other primary concern is that I am not allowed to be an administrator on my own work laptop. This makes it extremely inconvenient when I need to install new software for research purposes but I have to track down the IT agent for my department before I can even do my work.  UITS could improve by including more data analysis and modeling software. These things are difficult to pay for as a graduate student and early career person. Also the wired system doesn't have the capacity to deal with data that is not \"large\" but that contains video files.  Staff has been consistently helpful, with knowledge of technology and application for instruction or presentation.  The biggest positive about my most recent experiences with UITS is the quick response time. Both by phone and email I've gotten assistance very promptly on my last two inquiries.  Love chat consultation feature. Some concern with the reduced staffing hours at Wells.  None  The university requirement that all laptops have CITO as administrator is an impossible obstacle for many of us, and it puts those in the community who can afford to purchase their own laptop at an unfair advantage. Lacking administrative access to my own laptop, for instance, cost me three full days of research work last week, and led additionally to me needing to rewrite from scratch a very long letter of recommendation. Why? Because the laptop had reset in a way that it lacked access to the internet, could not update the clock, to get something as simple as the clock to update required administrative access --which I lacked. So I could not send anything from that laptop to anywhere else where I could access it. No matter, I thought! I'll just take a flash drive and transfer the files at issue over to another (friend's) computer (or one at the office.) But no. The command to reset the clock wouldn't disappear unless I reset the clock and the computer wouldn't let me have access to anything else unless I reset the clock. Which I couldn't do because I lacked administrative access. I realize that this is not UITS's regulation, but this is the only opportunity I have to note my frustration with this seemingly utterly unnecessary imposition on faculty research. My colleagues, having a great deal more financial means than I, have to work around this by just buying their own computer. To put me at a disadvantage, research wise, because I don't have their inherited money is an injustice.  I have always received good service from UITS.  I wish we could adapt Canvas gradebook and rubrics to fit our own classes. The gradebook design is not good. I would consult with a Canvas rep if they want to reach out to me at [IRD]. Thank you for all your work keeping us connected!!  I frequently discover issues with IT technology at IU, file a UITS request for help, and the problem never gets resolved. That has happened at least twice the past year.  Some of the tools are a joke, Canvas being the leading contender. Sometime I read the instructions to do what should be a simple thing--they are often horrendous work-arounds.  I do not consider myself to be a heavy user of IT. That said, I find that the services I use, mostly associated with JSoM, are user friendly, even intuitive. Any issues have been quickly resolved and we are kept up to date on outages, planned or unplanned. I have always received timely replies to email inquiries or phone calls and the Music ITS staff will stop by my office when necessary. Most of the office visits are due to problems with the computer itself, not the systems or services provided.  I am satisfied with the UITS!  It would be nice if all IT staff are members of UITS. It seems that each department hires IT staff who work with UITS personnel. In this way, however, it may be difficult for UITS to learn more specific needs depending on the academic field unless the dept. staff describes/reports to UITS (or even if so it would cause a delay to transfer the information to UITS). Besides, IT staff in our dept. is usually busy and cannot respond to our question promptly (it took about 3 months to finally receive help the last time we requested it, even after asking several times to find when they were available to work for us). If UITS manage manpower of all IT staff on campus, the manpower can be allocated more appropriately between the departments.  Phoning UITS has helped me with some Canvas issues.  I have primarily worked with ETS staff for hardware and software trouble-shooting. There were many things on that survey that I was unaware of in terms of online teaching tools (I primarily teach online, but I do not often seek out new tools myself). Zoom is the best, I use it for everything, including recording webcasts for my classes. Canvas is ok, there are some good features but also some poor features. KnowledgeBase is quite helpful and I can usually get my questions answered there. I don't love the one.iu format (the \"app\" format as opposed to lists is just not intuitive to me), but the search bar is easy enough to use if I know what I'm looking for.  I have had very positive experiences with UITS.  N/A  No concerns. My interactions with the UITS staff were positive, generally speaking.  I have only had positive experiences with UITS, but have not had to access them often.  You all are great! Each time I call the hotline number I get excellent help!  No concerns. Have only had terrific support.  The only interaction I have had with UITS during the past year is printing a poster in Wells Library for a conference. This was a nightmare. It should have taken just minutes but instead it used up most of an afternoon. For a university that prides itself on technology services this is utterly unacceptable. While the technical issues were not too bad (though not zero, either -- it would be nice if it were possible to print from a variety of formats, including keynote, PowerPoint, pdf files, just to name a few), what used up hours of time was trying to find a way to pay for the service! For reasons that are truly beyond me, departmental accounts were unacceptable, as were credit cards and even cash! I understand from various colleagues that they have had similar issues. Like I said, a) printing posters should be possible (!!), and b) it should take no more than a few minutes. FIX THIS!!!!!  The main difficulty is trying to download needed software (often on a time crunch) and I have to wait for UITS to confirm. Even simple updates (like iTunes) cannot be done in the moment, and I have to send a request for them which I don't usually have time to do.  I had an issue with my printer and the IT department was very quick to respond to my request. They resolved the problem very quickly and I was very pleased.  Canvas is inferior to Oncourse.  The Biology computer support group is top-notch. They are knowledgeable, responsive and prompt.  I have a major problem with a discrepancy with what I need to be able to do to maintain a lab and what our computer staff is allowed to help with. My lab involves about 10 workstations, some attached to hardware and some that are for computations. I also have people attaching to large data sets. We need more administrative privileges. While I am very supportive of security, there are all sorts of special cases. Sticking to my own computer. I attach a 40 Tbyte drive array (always attached). There is no need to scan this every week. Anything that gets on it, already comes through a portal that is also scanned. Scanning it fully takes days. There are other examples. In this case I actually have local user account for administration, but I cannot access settings to turn this particular scan off.  Thus, my basic concern is that local computer staff have their hands tied. They have local knowledge and could make reasonable accommodations. One approach could be a more layered network approach. Many of my workstations could be limited easily so they do not have routable IP addresses. They work internally, no need to reach outside.  Positive - UITS people try to help when called on. SPEABITS guys are mostly very responsive. Negatives -1. 8556789 people can be useless, not always having the right knowledge. (But they always try...).  Please, for God's sake, disable auto-startup for Kaltura Classroom. It's a minor irritant, but one that *always* disrupts my pre-class setup. A simple shortcut on the desktop ought to suffice for those who use the program.  I appreciate they are always on hand to help. I have not had a negative experience with any staff when I need computer help. I also appreciate that since we do outside campus work on Canvas with our vendors, the UITS staff is there to help them troubleshoot as well. Please continue to be open to teachers who are busy and need help knowing how to obtain courses from Canvas. Canvas can always be more intuitive!!  I appreciate the on-going tutorials for Canvas, Zoom, etc. - always available when I need.  None.  I feel very supported by UITS staff. They are prompt in their responses and always extremely helpful.  The staff in the IU SPEA (Bloomington Campus) were very helpful when a guest speaker, at the last minute, let me know that they couldn't attend the class in person. With very short notice the UITS staff was able to install a camera so that the individual could speak to the class virtually. He was a lifesaver that day. I greatly appreciated his help.  I believe that IU is among the best in higher education in the breadth and depth of IT services provided to faculty, staff, and students.  Only positive  I got speedy assistance when I cracked the screen on a laptop. I was very pleased.  I want to be able to access my Exchange Outlook account on my iPad and iPhone. I hate the Unicom system -- my phone doesn't ring and the handset doesn't work even though the phone is fine. Our IT folks have been unable to troubleshoot what the problem is so I am forced to use my PRIVATE cell phone THAT I PAY FOR business calls.  Uploading grades to Canvas is troublesome.  I collaborate extensively with EDS and have had excellent experiences interacting with the staff.  Updated classrooms tend to be excellent; I do wish that classroom renovations include movable furniture, multiple video screens, and usable white board space. Older classrooms are not prepared for active learning. I teach in a blend of old and new classrooms. The survey doesn't get at the details of what I like and don't like about classrooms--and I want to be sure that it is clear that I think UITS understands what to do to design classrooms.  UITS staff who've helped install / set up faculty office computers seem completely unfamiliar with Macs. This has been a bit frustrating when trying to set up a new machines and get software installed.  Generally positive, particularly in helping with trouble-shooting through the UITS online chat help service.  Overall, software works pretty well. Office works pretty well. The 2-factor authentication works pretty well. The VPN client (Windows) works well. Box is meh, and does not work as well or as reliably as dropbox. (Works for sharing single files. Does not work as a synced / mirrored drive across multiple machines like dropbox.) Solstice connects easily but often lags by seconds or even minutes, making it less useful for in-class coding and other interactive work (when teaching).  Incompatibility of outlook and non-outlook calendaring systems has been an issue. I can't grant read- only access to my outlook calendar outside IU which makes it hard to manage and coordinate, and outlook support for google calendars is touchy. I wish I could just grant read-only access to some people, and read/write access to my gmail account so I can manage all my calendars and reliably access them from one place.  Managed desktop workstations are perceptibly laggy in reading/writing/accessing files. Is this a function of non-local desktops, my documents, etc.? Mandated low-performance software? (Real-time virus scans of each XML data file I create in simulations are not great.) There's no reason my 5+ year old desktop workstation at home should reliably out-perform my new 4-core/8-thread workstation here on the same simulation loads.  Some software, like POV-Ray, seems to be incompatible with installing on the mapped network profiles.  Perhaps I should just change to self-managed machine?  Support for my graduate students on accessing HTC / HPC resources has been very good!  Since everything for programs have been put in the cloud and how these services are accessed is not clear, I find it much more difficult to actually do work that used to be simple. In the old days I just downloaded the recent program to my computer and could use it 24/7. This does not seem to be how cloud-based tech works so my opinion of UITS has gone downhill recently.  The classroom technologies and other equipment should be checked regularly. Sometimes the temperature in the room makes people uncomfortable, e.g. too hot in the summer. Many times the batteries of the microphones are used up.  Staff is always responsive in timely, gracious, and helpful manner. Issues stem from computer updates, typically.  Safe  More outreach about Duo and free Duo tokens would be good for new students.  I would prefer to move to google for faculty email too. It is a better and easier system than outlook.  1) Security: IU has been doing quite a bit to increase security in order to protect IU interests. This has only partially benefited the employees. Examples: I am not allowed to have the hard drive of my office computer encrypted. Canvas runs off Amazon services, which are not encrypted. Do more to protect employees.  2.)        Licensing agreements: It seems that decisions as to what software is licensed for IU use are made short term and not in a very transparent way.  3.)        Personal Web Pages: There appears to be no interest at IU to encourage faculty to maintain personal web pages. It would be nice to have a WordPress installation at IU that one can use and customize.  I had a great experience with someone helping me with setting up an online class. Then she moved jobs and I couldn't get good help after that. Very frustrating.  Getting the lab off the ground was not as smooth as I would have liked, we had to wait weeks for our printers to be networked successfully, but now that it's chugging along things seem to be going well. Since the lab has been set up, Andrew Quick has been great to work with when minor problems arise.  I have worked with Sam Underwood to make videos for students and he was extremely helpful. I cannot recommend him highly enough.  I have been very happy with the performance of UITS. They have always been helpful and respond very quickly.  One point: Do printers in the School need replacement? I only say this because often they do not work. Some of my students have complained too.  Second, can these services be made easier to get over weekends and holidays?  Services are typically good. Only concern is slow response time to address help desk tickets.  I have had much good luck with CITO and usually with UITS but only when we are able to do a screen share.  I deeply appreciate that the staff is always helpful.   ### Staff responses:  Every call to UITS has always been a productive use of my time as the reps are all knowledgeable, courteous, and actively listen. I appreciate their customer service.  More in-depth, hands-on help with Lists (for beginners) and how to use them effectively.  I have very little interaction with IT, but what I have had has been positive.  The limitation of access to system information between Administration and Auxiliaries, makes it difficult to perform necessary functions and is frustrating. Specifically, this is in regards to Auxiliary employees access to SIS on an as needed for business functions basis. While this is not directly a UITS policy, it does involve systems that UITS supports. Please review the policy for exceptions for business related functions.  I've called UITS in the past, and had my call automatically roll to a different \"tier\" without me knowing it. The different tier groups aren't clear to faculty, staff, or students, and until I asked many questions, I didn't understand why the person at UITS was so confused by my question. Once it was explained that the different tiers handle different issues, and I was NOT talking to the tier group I had called, it became clear.  The documentation on how to integrate my IU email on my phone was great. I was able to successfully complete.  I have always found UITS staff to be quite helpful. My most recent interaction was at the Learning Commons where I picked up a token to facilitate my duo log-in; I was assisted immediately by a professional and courteous staff member, and the process was extraordinary quick and simple. The one concern that I would have is that UITS performs so many tasks for the university that I wonder how call center staff would be able to confidently address all the possible issues that faculty, staff, and students might encounter and who are directed to simply \"contact UITS.\"  I find UITS to be mostly unhelpful and opaque. For a service provider, I am often not happy with the service provided but I have no alternative. The core services that I use function enough to complete my work but too often either do not work as intended and require work-around or the services I provide are modified to accommodate failings in the IT resources. The IT resources are defining the services I provide rather than the other way around. Moreover, my department is charged for fixing issues with systems that were designed and created by UITS but did not meet expectations or does not work as intended. If asked, I will always recommend that any department I interact with use a vended product rather than a UITS product if at all possible.  I only have positive interactions with UITS. Ours is out of the Foundation and they are the most responsive IU that I have ever had in any employer I have ever been with in my career. I have to say specifically that Eric McFall and Spencer Utt are rock stars. Kind, responsive, good listeners, and quickly solve all issues.  My interactions are almost exclusively through SCT2 and they are on-the-ball.  I always get thorough answers from the research computing people - very pleased with everyone I work with. As more cloud computing resources are available (AWS for instance) it would be nice for some training classes - I see Illinois has some. LOVE red desktop!!!!  I have had great interactions with the person from UITS I've had assistance from, Jeremy Simpson. He has been so helpful and timely with his responses that he is my preferred contact in UITS. I've never had any cause for complaint with any of the IT services I have received.  Overall good experiences with UITS. I always get a prompt response if I am having trouble. And I like all of the training opportunities that UITS has to offer.  I am pleased! I do not like the wireless guest access for Wi-Fi since it switched from AT&T hotspot. The new IU Guest Wi-Fi kicks you offline unless you're streaming. This means I have no idea when I was kicked off so I can be missing important emails when they come through. It requires constantly signing back in over and over again throughout the day.  Our office recently moved locations and the networking people (John Stigall in particular) were very quick to respond to issues. Also, we frequently have to work with the Messaging Team and they have been extremely helpful as well.  My laptop was worked on last year and at the time reconfigured so that it is mostly unusable for me. Very little explanation at the time. Many new passwords were created within a half an hour.  No one in my unit knows how to forward phone calls on polycon.  I have had mostly good experiences with UITS, especially lately. I only had one experience that was negative, where I gave remote control of my laptop to someone from UITS and they did something that deleted all of my work the week of finals. Luckily, someone else was able to fix it, and it's been nothing but positive since then.  Outlook is getting harder to use as messages get stuck in the outbox a lot of times and cause me to have to restart my computer.  Our department does a great job although I feel that they are overworked and not as responsive with one full -time person gone.  Many IT support personnel are overwhelmed, contributing to policy compliance shortcomings. Status.iu.edu needs to provide better ETAs on restoring service.  I have no negative comments. I do have a questions about what is meant by UITS staff. Are the team members here in the Service Building considered UITS staff? Jeff, Gary, Michael, Zach, and John are all great to work with and provide excellent support. Outside of that group I am not aware of any interactions I have with UITS staff.  Accessibility, accessibility, accessibility -- PDFs and web training as well as a go to person to ask about best practices.  I just tried to purchase two licenses to Visio. I got an order confirmation but no real info about whether it was a disc, download of something magically to come down from the sky. Just contacted rep who told me to check with \"iuware@iu.com\" to see if they received my download.  Every interaction I've had with UITS employees has been positive. They are so very helpful whether it be with helpdesk on the phone, in person at the Wells Library, etc.  I'm a staff member and I moved from a UITS-supported unit to a [IRD] supported unit, and it has been a culture shock for me. The amount of funding that UITS has versus [IRD] is staggering...and it's quite common for IT pros to get their foot in the IU door at [IRD] and then, if they're a good employee, migrate to a better-funded and higher-paying department like UITS. This leaves a lower-tier of staff at [IRD] and the quality of IT support (and IT security!) in [IRD] Administration suffers. I'm not sure that many employees here even realize this is a problem, as they don't know how \"good\" they could have it. I'd love to see UITS further centralize IT structure at IU Bloomington, and help provide a better IT experience for everyone.  Overall positive experiences. Most people that I interact with are willing and eager to help.  The longer I've been with the University, the better my interactions with UITS have been. As I have become more familiar, the easier it has been to find assistance with the services we use. The initial learning curve on who to contact, along with team/management shifts inside UITS, was slightly high as a new LSP. (started in late 2015)  I haven't used UITS too much, but the staff in the library are always really nice and helpful. I do not like the phone system - it is hard to hear and sometimes calls don't come through very well.  UITS rolls out updates w/o proper testing and it causes major problems for the end users. E.g., an update to Pulse Secure was rolled out that caused all kinds of problems such as the laptop locking up randomly causing the user to reboot. This was very costly in time. UITS needs to be more cautious rolling out updates, giving units more time to test how any given update may interact with the unit's individual programs.  The UITS staff were very helpful to me when I needed their help resolving an Adobe licensing agreement. It took awhile to figure out, but they were very patient!  I would love to take some basic computer classes; Word, excel, power point, etc. I don't see them offered anywhere.  I am an academic advisor. It would be very helpful if it were possible to access SIS in more than one browser tab at once -- for example, to run a student's Academic Advisement Report in one tab while using the Course Search in another. Often during an advising appointment I need to switch back and forth between different features of SIS.  A university IT division is and should be the driving force behind supporting every entity across IU. Investing additional revenue to ensure that IT initiatives grows with the ambition of the university is imperative. From my role as a marketer and communications professional at the university, I believe some of the best investments in IT include the CRM, web, email marketing, and Google efforts.  Helpnet has been helpful for desktop support. Mike Queto is very good.  Security reviews for RFPs seem to take a very long time.  I have had a very positive experience and interaction with our IT Support team. Melanie Ebdon and her staff. In particular TC Bradley has been outstanding in support of our custom eDossier application.  Also very positive experience with our local IT Support which is the Exec IT team in Bryan Hall.  All my dealings have been indirectly with UITS, but they have always responded in a timely and efficiently manner.  I do get a little frustrated with some of the classroom technology, particularly since I teach.  Overall, I am very satisfied with services provided by UITS.  No issues with UITS staff except for long wait times to hear back from them.  It would be a great improvement if the software classes (excel series, etc.) let you save your spot of the lesson to close and return to.  SIS has some issues and a lot of barriers preventing errors being corrected in a timely fashion, so our office learns to continually use the work-arounds and double checking for errors that are too common. Our office built some of our SIS parts having to do with transfer credit without thorough practice or investigation, so it remains to not be effective. There are too many barriers to update SIS and our department does not allocate enough resources (time, brainpower and the pay these two require) to plan how to change SIS to work better for us.  Before developing a new service or application, speak to and have meetings with the ones who use it on a daily bases. Find out what they need to do their job and what the service needs to be able to do. While testing, have an environment were in you can test all scenarios.  The UITS staff are very nice and helpful.  The decentralized nature of IT support at IU is confusing.  Ranji Abraham and his area have been vital to the success of our organization and we're so thankful that he has been so supportive of all that we do.  I think the push for digital signatures is pointless. I think it creates a false sense of security.  Response time since switching IT groups (to tech select) has been amazing. While sometimes expertise in certain areas hinder getting a fast result, the team always works until an answer is found. Our department has some unique software that causes some hiccups, but the group doesn't give up.  For the last [IRD] years I have been telling the same old story not enough IT workers for the demanding amount of work expected, pay scale is a joke, how much do you need to hear that? UITS constantly under new employees hard to keep good talent, data storage options are out of control users have way to many options which is causing confusing and extra work for it pros, lack of IU tools to support end users out in field away from IU is a concern, VPN vulnerabilities as well as many constant upgrades cause more work for overworked ITPros as remote users can be challenging. IDF SW is far too demanding on portables users gripe about many false positives, recent sccm testing failed to bring VPN issues to light as there was no testing environment for ItPros outside of using personal smart phones as hot spots, far far too many surveys to fill out - everyone in the world wants a survey for the littlest thing if I enjoyed your assistance I will make a comment to you and admin, stop bombardment of such items.  I have had nothing but positive IT interactions.  My experiences with UITS staff & services over many years have been good overall. No complaints.  UITS has always been very responsive and helpful when I have had to reach out to them with issues.  My experience with UITS staff and services has been positive. I put in a lot of tickets for web related services and they are always handled quickly and the issue, if any, is always taken care of.  Response time is great, staff is friendly and helpful. Training courses get me what I need.  I am a fairly new employee so I do not have a lot of experience with the UITS staff yet.  None at this time.  My concern is that I usually have to diagnose and fix my own IT problems simply because I utilize a Mac at work. It would be great if IU employed IT folks who were able to work on this.  I have always enjoyed the friendly help I encounter with the 812-855-6789 helpline. I have called both for my own needs, as well as when assisting walk-in staff who visit the HR department. UITS Tech Select has also been AWESOME to work with for all our HR technology needs. I would like to see more robust Wi-Fi coverage available on campus because there are many dead zones.  My only negative: there was a day when I went to the UITS station at the IMU with a re-hire -- there was supposed to be a person at the IMU station, but there wasn't.  I would say that all of my interactions with UITS have been positive. I cannot think of any negative experiences.  I would like to mention one group in particular that has been outstanding on assisting me with my issues and that would be the EWA group.  Chrome River is terrible to use. Not impressed with the ability to find anything. Auditing will be very difficult.  When I travel to other Big Ten schools for athletic events, they have Wi-Fi networks that work and do not require any password. I think that would be something that visitors to IU would appreciate.  The UITS staff I dealt with when we got new computers setup were very helpful.  2 complaints:  -           UITS response time on ticket  -           IU KB. It's hard to find some content for IT pros  Staff are great, there just aren't enough resources dedicated to optimizing use of \"enterprise-wide\" systems. I find the allocation of resources disappointing.  I have never had a negative experience with UITS staff or services in 24 years and I've seen a lot of improvement in communication between users and staff. The Knowledge Base is an excellent resource though some directions are less helpful than I expect, especially due to changes in procedures I think, or the writers not being able to understand what things look like to even a fairly knowledgeable user.  I've generally had positive experiences. There are some things that are problematic for administrative staff -- Box is great for storing and sharing, but it can be difficult when others create folders to share with you and their folder names are not very descriptive. Let's say I run the Jones Office. Everyone then makes a folder with some slight variation of \"Jones Office.\" It makes finding things in Box difficult.  Outlooks is a powerful tool, but searching Outlook for an old email can be a frustrating experience. I've heard this from other professionals as well.  I used to take advantage of staffed training classes regularly when there was a schedule for these in- person classes. I always found these useful. I need to try one of the classes through Dashboard and see how it works out. I'm appreciative that these exist.  Unique placed and facilities oriented UITS staff at Service building are great; and greatly needed! We could use regular, update, and basic to advanced software training to numerous Capital Projects/Service Building staff on AutoDesk products (Revit, AutoCAD, Sketchup, etc.). As is provided on other software we use like Microsoft Office, Outlook, Excel etc.  It would be nice to have a list of names for contact. I work from 5:30 PM until 2:00 AM Monday - Friday. There has been times that I was not able to log in to our computer. I didn't know who to contact for help. Also, we have the Kuali clock in machine in a hallway at Smith Research that our employees use during the week. It always seems to have problems. There are several staff members in this building that also use this machine. Would it be possible to have more machines installed in this building, so someone on the far West end of the building and South side of the building don't have to walk so far to use this machine. One machine is just not enough for a building of this size. And over 100 plus staff members in the area.  I rarely interact with UITS but my few experiences with help have been productive.  The 3rd shift used to send new members to the Library so they can get their crimson cards and duo fobs created. Recently, UITS changed their working hours at the Library and our new staff is now forced to attempt to get to the Library during day hours, when there is no parking, parking enforcement is ticketing and their immediate supervisors are not available to help guide them through the process. Plus, you are asking 3rd shift staff to interrupt their sleep in order to accomplish this. It is the equivalent of asking a day shift worker to drive to the Library at two in the morning to get their paperwork completed. This is VERY INCONVENIENT for 3rd shift staff. A nice compromise would be for UITS to provide extended service hours at the Library for 1 or 2 nights a week, so 3rd shift management could arrange a convenient time to assist their new staff members with acquiring crimson cards and fobs. PLEASE EXTEND SERVICE HOURS AT THE LIBRARY TO MIDNIGHT ONE OR TWO NIGHTS A WEEK.  The staff has been very helpful.  The help desk is wonderful. Keep up the good work.  Your on-line request for service needs a lot of attention. It is difficult to navigate and does not offer the kind of support needed during the design of a renovation. It is even less helpful when we are forced to use it to acquire UITS support when a project is under construction.  Also in need of attention is your email response to any sort of request for service. The email messages are cryptic and do not help move the conversation forward.  Smaller departments that can't fund an onsite IT staff would greatly benefit from UITS support. I think it can be confusing to individuals (faculty and staff) as to whether they are allowed to use UITS and what departmental cost would be incurred in situations where a departmental IT staff is unavailable to assist them but perhaps they could reach out to UITS support. I think in these cases faculty/staff are just waiting for their departmental staff to become available to resolve their IT issue, either because they want to avoid cost to the department or they don't realize this is an option to them.  1)         Linux support could be better. Too many services are Windows-centric & don't play well with others.  2)         I occasionally have to research lab purchases & then forward the information to a departmental administrator for fulfillment. KFS is very clunky for this, with a different procedure required for each vendor.  UITS has always responded very fast to all of any issues I have had and fixed them the same day within hours. I wish every place was like that.  My last positive was the person that assisted me in the Wells Library to change my passphrase. He was patient and made sure it updated correctly.  I've had nothing but positive experiences with UITS.  I have no complaints as to the service I require from UITS.  I often wonder if IU isn't spending too much money on glitzy technology when low tech is a better use of resources.  I HATE the knowledge base. It seems when I have a question I always get directed there, but to my knowledge, I have NEVER found an answer to what I need there. I have wasted so much time trying to find the answer or solution and always end up calling for help. Sorry, but I think the KB is a terrible waste of resources.  Recommendation for new service: Sycamore Hall needs a student printer. I work in an academic unit in SY and have at least one student every other day ask where a printer is located in Sycamore and/or if they can use our department printer (no they cannot).  Integration of systems, for example KFS and Chrome River would be helpful for staff. Chrome River has not turned out to be the pot of gold that we were promised and now we have two separate actions lists to check on a daily basis. Just the problems with Chrome River could take a whole other survey.  IUIE while helpful, is clunky, dated, and not user friendly for those who are new to the system. There has got to be a better way to pull reports from KFS, and in real time.  Same with SIS, which is also clunky and not intuitive.  Fillippo Manucci, who works at the IU Health Center IT Dept., is always quick to respond, knowledgeable and easy to work with. Not always the case with others in the dept.  I've had very little contact with UITS this year personally. However, I have observed another staff, who submits request for approval of software purchases, and UITS has responded to those requests in a timely manner.  I have found the staff to be available and knowledgeable.  I would like to have secure IU fax services be able to fax critical data such as credit card information.  I am very frustrated with the overall IT services at IUHC. I certainly understand the need for patient confidentiality, but the number of passwords and the frequency with which they need to be changed is almost unbearable. And it is frustrating to have all these protections and STILL not be able to work on patient notes anywhere but my IUHC office. Today, I am home [IRD], knowing there is a ton of work I could get done, if only I was treated like a competent, responsible professional. Similarly, I have been training [IRD] interns for IU for 20 years, and we still can not get a videotaping system that works. I mean we are 'I f'n U' and it appears we are still patching together a series of outdated hard and soft wares.  In my experience the IT staff are quick to respond, kind, and explain in detail how to troubleshoot something if I can't figure it out first.  UITS staff have always been very helpful.  I find the UITS staff to meet my needs and I am satisfied with their service.  I understand that the volume of technology requests must be high but having a phone number for direct contact rather than putting in a work order for a simple issue would be wonderful.  Sometimes it is hard to know where you should go for information needed or help with a problem. Some of the tickets request information that those of us less computer savvy might not know. Overall, once I have gotten to the right place, I have received the help I needed and been happy with the assistance given.  I would love to be able to have printer access as a staff member when I am away from my office, but still working. This would include places like the library or the union where there are printers, but may need to print off something for work.  1.)        As I work remotely (outside of Indiana), I heavily rely on VPN and sometimes the network is extremely slow (not sure if it's because I'm a few states over in NY?)  2.)        The IU online fax service is great! I just wish it was available/secure for transmitting information for PCI DSS as some recruitment events my department hosts require a faxed credit card authorization form and I don't have access (being remote) to a secure fax machine.  3.)        The biggest complaint I have regarding technology at IU is the RC level support for OEM. It becomes quite a challenge to get help or even a straight answer from the tech team, as if they're unaware of how technology works or what they're responsible for (ordering tech and supplies, and servicing specific equipment). I understand this is not a reflection of UITS, but still incredibly frustrating and could leave a bad impression of UITS on other departmental staff.  So far in my short time with the University my experience with UITS has been very good. I like the notifications about system updates and changes. Most recent examples are the Antivirus update for the Macs, moving to Eset, and the VPN certificate update notification. We received a few reports of certificate errors so the notice that it would be updated was helpful.  The telephone hardware is awful. Cheap, cheap, cheap.  Trying to get updates to KFS and other systems is almost impossible. Workaround is the only thing. We have workarounds for our workaround. It is a disgrace!  I have had good interactions online and in person with UITS staff.  While I understand the need to be vigilant about data security, I feel like we are way over the top on this issue. We can't get the programs or software we need without a very long review process and we're being asked to purge files that we would prefer to keep.  I also regularly have to restart or shut down my computer because it loses it's Outlook connection.  I am new to the university and haven't had but a couple of interactions with the staff. I have found everyone so far to be very helpful, patient and informative.  After taking this survey, I'm realizing that I don't know about a lot of the resources that UITS has to offer. As a staff member, I don't think we're trained or well informed about all that UITS offers other than what is already on our computers (skype for business, one.iu, etc.). I really like the MONITOR newsletter, so maybe there can be a Did You Know section.  Exec IT is truly wonderful. They're responsive and helpful.  Sometimes instructions on Knowledge base or IT instructions in general need to be better explained in simple, layperson terms. Do you have people outside of IT read written instructions to test if they can be easily followed? If not, I highly recommend this as a QI project.  Generally, UITS staff respond quickly to requests we make for their services and they complete their tasks with thoroughness and excellence. There are times that, due to the nature of business that our office conducts, issues rise rapidly and IT services are urgently needed. The UITS team who serves us, although occasionally short-staffed, usually retains flexibility and manages to cover our urgent needs.  On the negative side, there have been a few situations where scheduled IT assistance did not arrive and a reminder call had to be made. The IT staff either overlooked the request, or through some glitch/oversight, the event \"fell off\" their calendar. On one of those occasions, we were unable to reach an IT staff member by email or phone prior to a meeting requiring their services and our office staff had to perform their tasks. The negative experiences are rare and the positive ones are abundant.  Stop using ThinkPad's, slow or no responses.  I use our internal department technology services and am very pleased with the service I have received.  My experience with UITS Staff has always been delightfully positive.  UITS Staff conduct themselves with the highest professional standards in speech and behavior. They are patient, and they listen carefully before responding.  They don't rush you. They make sure that they have addressed all of my concerns and they don't make me feel uncomfortable when they ask questions.  The UITS Team is a top notch professional group of respectful individuals with a mission to serve and help instruct those of us who are not as computer literate as they are without making us feel inferior in knowledge.  I appreciate them and their good nature interaction style of sharing technical knowledge. They represent their department at IU very well.  I like all the communication concerning security and phishing. I would like there to be phone numbers to contact UTIS staff in the Library.  I haven't had many interactions with UITS staff, but the few that I have had have been positive. The only problems I've had have been with Canvas or Digital Desk related and they were resolved quickly.  Main thing I'll say, from an academic staff perspective, is that it's too bad everything has become so centralized \"system-wide\", meaning things we need to get done to benefit students in our unit or even campus become placed low on the priority chain. This is perhaps a broader issue with administration, but I believe the effort toward \"shared services\" across the entire institution has hurt service to individuals as a whole.  I have frequently over the last 18 years called 5-6789 and always received excellent service and swift assistance from a polite and patience customer service person. Best service possible. Always consistent.  Do not find the KB helpful AT ALL - never clear steps 1, 2, 3 - time-consuming trying to fathom what is meant - instant and perfect assistance speaking with UITS customer service.  I enjoy that IU has been keeping up to date with our current technology changes. Although, as general supervisor for the building services department, not a lot of our staff have the proper training to use the kuali system. Also on that note, the IU library card services have changed there hours for the many of us who work third shifts. Not sure if that relates to this or not but thought I'd throw that in there. Also with Kuali all of our clock in screens are to small of print with many of our staff that have large hands. Our senior workers have much difficulty learning the system. Maybe a way to enter hours could be changed.  Interactions with individual UITS reps during tech help phone calls is generally very good. It's unclear to me what all is in the UITS portfolio, so this next note may not be relevant. SIS course search has its strengths, but doesn't properly filter for \"Show open classes only.\" It shows orphaned discussions, lectures, and labs that the student can't take because another required component of the class is closed; meaning that the class itself is essentially closed even if there are some seats in one component. It's very frustrating to know that these kind of bugs hold no priority with respect to the Fix List. They are hugely impactful on students and staff, just as the loss of rain checking from the registration system years ago continues to be a serious loss to the process of registering. Those who use \"upgraded\" or \"new and improved\" software so often experience it as a step backward, and a net loss.  Generally, the people I have interfaced with have been helpful, polite, and professional.  In the world of academic advising it is often unclear whether issues with systems such as AdRx, iGPS, SIS, etc. should be reported to UITS or OCSS.  One very inconvenient issue I run into is when my computer has to be updated, especially in the middle of a conference/video call. The computer has to restart and there is no way to dismiss it.  It would be nice to see my degree map process in real time. I can see an outline of the courses needed for my undergrad degree, but as far as I can tell, there is no way to see which of those courses I have already taken or apply to the degree.  No thoughts, concerns, issues or ideas.  I have had many positive experiences with UITS. There have been several stellar UITS personnel who have treated me and others in my department with respect. That said, though, the overall culture of UITS seems very centric. There are IT people outside of UITS who are competent. For example, when Brad Wheeler says good things about IT at IU at Statewide, his only focus is on UITS. That seems to be a common attitude at UITS. There are lots of good things happening at IU with IT that don't involve UITS.  Numerous positive experiences with UITS. Our team works largely with EITS. They are a very supportive team and have good systems in place, willing to go the extra mile and to help us with the exec-level needs with which we work. The times when we have had concerns or issues arise have been when the team is overworked or understaffed. The teams really do a very good job in trying to be there for each of us!  KFS/IUIE UI is not user-friendly. Would love to see updates made to these systems for better front- and back-end functionality.  Why is there so much focus on bright, shiny, new things like Salesforce that are useless to the majority of IU's users, while services such as purchasing, financial management, travel, student systems and services, WCMS, etc. remain clunky, appear outdated and are not user-friendly?  Why does this survey have no options for \"I have never heard of this service\"? I didn't know securitycenter.iu.edu existed until I took this survey.  My area falls within the College of Arts and Sciences, so I usually interact with CITO. However, UITS has been very helpful and responsive when I've needed assistance from their staff.  No negatives so far. The one thing that has been interesting at IU is the division of what gets handled at the school level and what gets handled at the UITS level. The separation as a systems user is difficult to understand and creates inefficiency in getting issues resolved. I feel like issues get resolved but you don't always know where to start and it often takes getting bounced between UITS and KSBIT or the opposite.  Overall my experiences with UITS has been positive. I have especially appreciated those who have worked in the Wells Library and with the OVPR IT team. Sometimes it can be difficult to navigate getting new employees the equipment they need in a timely fashion but that has very much depended upon the department we're working with (and the department the new employee is in) rather than UITS as a whole. My experiences as a staff member at SPEA have been especially positive, even when there have been issues with my computer equipment.  I think there could be improvements to KFS and other administrative trainings. I think that IDAH is an excellent resource for creative activity & humanities research for faculty.  I have been working with UITS e-Design & Learning Services team for 2-3 years now to support online programs. Without a doubt, their team is beyond supportive! Not only that, but they are informative, compassionate, and dedicated to providing a quality outcome for all constituents. They certainly make my job easier, as it is a service I can trust and depend on to meet deadlines, policies, and other matters.  I'm relatively new to IU and I have experienced frustration with implementing changes related to IT. It's hard to know who to go to for what. The software I use must be HIPAA compliant which adds to slow changes, complicated systems and are not user friendly and don't produce reports I need.  I do not interact with UITS.  I have had positive experiences with UITS staff.  All UITS personnel are friendly and knowledgeable.  They are always responding very fast to our questions or problems. Every staff is wonderful to work with.  Will/Can UITS initiate a license agreement with an outside vendor to assist with unit website monitoring and improvement? (i.e. DubBot, Site Improve, etc.)  Need more institutional development offerings regarding basic skills through experienced levels. Too many of our staff and faculty are far behind in computer skills, etiquette and understanding. It puts the entire institution at a disadvantage.  I find that the UITS offerings are robust, that my questions are always answered fully and promptly, and that the UITS employees are always more than willing to help everyone no matter their IT skill level. I am very impressed with and grateful for UITS.  IUIE tech services is quite slow in giving a solution to a request.  I just started on January 22nd, but so far so good.  My primary points of contact with UITS are Laura Klein, Rose Ann Hasty, Christine Conklin, Sam Roadruck, & Steve Brahaum. These UITS staff members are a joy to work with. They are knowledgeable, quick to respond, happy to answer any questions I ask, and are very friendly (even when telling me 'No'). Other sections in UITS could benefit from their customer service skills.  IT staff is very helpful and punctual. They admit they do not have the Macintosh training they wish they had. So, sometimes they need to search for solutions, which is fine. It would be nice if you could hire a Mac tech guy who is available for issues with Macs and apple or adobe products. MDSS or the new software is clunky to download and access and only a few staff have passwords to access.  Sometimes in the library stacks at wells it is hard to get a signal.  I've been pleased with the help I've received.  Mickie Leibacher takes care of athletics specifically and every single one of my interactions with her have been nothing but fantastic. She is always super helpful. When I was hired, she made sure I was set up with everything I needed and made sure I understood how to use everything. She makes regular rounds to us to make sure everyone is good. She is fantastic and a pleasure to work with.  Overall I believe IU is about 30 years behind in technology on the administrative side. When I came here I thought I went back about 20 years in software for budget, employee compliance and infrastructure for management. We are wasting sooooooo much money due to systems inefficiency. I believe a good systems engineer and solid software would do wonders for IU. I realize we are here for students, but the cost keep going up due to admin burden. As an administrator, I look for collaborations with the academic side as they have nice research and evaluation software/tools.  Very happy to have the collaboration - recently worked with IT Community Partners to see where we could use UITS tools. Trying to align and leverage UITS services.  The SPH IT department is great at what they do. They completed requests in a very timely manner, very courteous and if we have problems they are quick to fix them.  Better Wi-Fi coverage.  Sometimes reports that have been run in IUIE don't want to open up. It seems like the system thinks the report is open, but it's no where to be found. I keep clicking it to open, then I've got 3 or 4 of them. I run reports in IUIE all the time. It's not me, it's the system. I just visited the security website and changed my passphrase because I knew it was close to 2 years old. That website said that my electronic signature is expired and I disagree. My emails have the little red ticker and I use an electronic signature on some forms.  Can't think of anything right offhand. Nothing to add.  I've found UITS to be very helpful. My main interactions with them have been at the library. They were friendly and helped me get done what I went there to do.  I like working with Tier2 techs. They are polite, prompt, and usually helpful.  Why is it so hard to find out where to go to get an answer to a question or problem? Then, when you do speak to someone who possibly may be helpful, their cookie-cutter reply is \"You need to send an email to blahblahblah@blahblahblah and someone will get back with you.\" There needs to be a general directory listing all of the blahblahblah@blahblahblah's (and a brief description of the types of questions appropriate to send to that email address). I spend a lot of time looking for someone to help me resolve an issue, sending emails to the \"general email address for that type of question\", then waiting for a reply. Am I impatient? I don't think so. Just frustrated with the structure of customer service within the university.  I have had only positive personal interactions with folks on the UITS Help Desk--I feel very comfortable using this as my initial point of inquiry for any technical problem, and the consultants are personable, persistent, and try to stay with me until I report that my question is answered. As an academic advisor, many of my questions are really about academic systems, and the primary consultants are in other offices. In these cases, I feel that the UITS staff are not as familiar with the key resource contacts for my central areas (SIS, AdRx, etc.).  It would be amazing if IU had a license for Filemaker Pro. In shared offices having one phone attached to one person's computer has caused problems (the other computer is a student workstation). Kuali Time could be radically improved by not having every timesheet generate an email. One email  reminder that it is time to go approve timesheets would really make my Monday inbox far less horrifying.  UITS staff are generally helpful when they can be. As a webmaster, I would appreciate better communication when a search server is taken down or changed without my knowledge (it breaks my website)...or if webserve maintenance is happening - please let us know before the plug is pulled.  These situations have occurred and cause a lot of frustration for users.  As far as desktop computing and Windows administration goes, I sincerely feel there should be more lenience in letting professional staff (especially developers) have more administrative control over their workstations. My Windows machine is very slow and impeded by all the policies and controls imposed on it by TechSelect. The 15 or so minute timeout lock is very annoying and impedes productivity. Could it at least be 30-60 minutes? Developers need to install and uninstall a lot of tooling - its very inconvenient to have to request tech support for simple application updates and app installation. Any flexibility in this would help.  Last, I'd like to touch on the WCMS Cascade Server - its really time to get rid of this dinosaur in my opinion. It offers little usability to developers and users. The interface and associated languages are not conducive to productivity with web content management. Updates, upgrades, and migrations have been very difficult and painful. Web development is now much more lean and streamlined with more popular current open technologies and platforms like WordPress, Drupal, Static Site Generators and most recently JAMstack. Newer open source alternatives are far more usable and more well- documented. Using the WCMS is highly inconvenient for everyone and NOBODY I have ever spoken to at IU (developers or users) really cares much for it. It's clunky, slow, complex, and highly inefficient. Let's stop already with the quiet polite political correctness toward this old system and address the elephant in the room (the WCMS) and escort it out the door already. The WCMS framework, is in my opinion, an admirable but unsuccessful attempt at creating a more friendly user interface layer for an obsolete commercial CMS system. It also makes many websites at IU look very much like cookie cutter bland design. There is nothing unique or interesting from one site to the next. Excellent alternatives are available - let's move on to current technology that would make content management much easier for everyone! I do support using IU Branding - but lets not let it kill all creativity and uniqueness. In fact we should discuss how we can explore making sites unique within the constraints of IU branding. Thanks!  As a student, UITS has always been a great help.  As a staff member, UITS billing for server charges and contacting for helpful information has not been good. We have gotten charged several times for things as financial members, that we are not sure what they are. The description of the charge does not give any detail. My suggestion is to look into changing this, that way we, as staff members, know exactly what we are being charged for.  Great people to work with, excellent service.  Response time on desktop very slow and Wi-Fi hard to access.  I have always had positive experiences with UITS staff and I greatly appreciate their knowledge and help. They have always been respectful and kind, and they have always helped to solve my PC software issues.  My interactions with UITS over the years has been positive and I have always received the help I need.  I have had positive interactions with UITS staff over the years.  Jeremy Simpson and his team at Tech Select were new to our startup but have done a great job of meeting our needs as a wholly new department alone in the woods.  The help desk at the Library is great. Always able to help when I/we have a problem with our home equipment and connections.  All is well as is.  In regards to IT classes, instead of all online course through Canvas (which is difficult to navigate) I prefer in person sessions which are no longer available. I have attempted to use the online portals, but don't feel it meets my needs as I am unable to ask questions.  UITS have been helpful for the most part. CAITS have been lacking a bit though. Maybe it has to do with new set ups and the amount of demands that are being requested with reduced number of people working.  The help area is wonderful. Emails informative and quick. Chat was amazing. Cascades publishing is not adequate. Slow internet at my work computer is frustrating - I get better service on my phone - maybe it's just the computer. IU BOX is amazing, simply amazing.  Any time I have contacted UITS, I have always been treated well and the issue/s resolved.  I have always had great experience with UITS staff.  It is hard to know what goes through UITS vs Creative Services. Additionally, it has been challenging working with UITS as it seems that everything is at such a high level that it no longer can cater to our specific office needs.  I do not have any at this time.  I have used UITS to make conference call requests many times over the last 20 years and have always had quick response rate from helpful staff. Other than that, I really don't have that much interaction with UITS.  Support queries and requests have been handled quickly and professionally. Enterprise CRM needs to do a better job of communicating upcoming changes to the CRM to end users.  UITS staff has always responded quickly and well to my calls.  I have had a great experience in working out tech issues with SPEA IT staff. They are friendly and approachable and more than willing to help you regardless of your tech experience or knowledge of a certain issue.  As far as recommendations, I do have a few: First of all, as a staff member it would be really helpful if students and staff used the SAME email platform because it makes it very difficult to try and schedule things with students who work for me and even if I put a calendar event on their calendar, they don't typically see it or check/use outlook so it is worthless. They also don't have the ability to send me a meeting request if they needed to meet about an upcoming event or project they have prior to our regularly scheduled one on one time. If we didn't change the email platform and have all students use outlook, then we NEED to have the availability of using a website like Calendly which is able to sync to exchange accounts and you can provide students a link that they can click to book a time with you and it automatically syncs to my calendar and whatever calendar they are using so they get a reminder.  Currently I am not able to use Calendly or the similar \"Youcanbook.me\" as there is an error in attempting to sync. I have used Calendly at a previous institution that also used outlook (though students also used it and didn't have another option so it wasn't as critical to have but very useful) in addition to DUO authentication.  Secondly, I think that the university should look into investing in a better app platform for student engagement. I have heard many students talk about the lack of usability with the one.iu app. In my opinion it is useful for certain things. However, when it comes to student engagement and finding out about events and resources and opportunities for them, one.iu doesn't not do that well and currently the FYE department has an app through guidebook. I have worked at a bigger school prior to IU and we utilized Involvio as they have systems in place for both orientation but also for campus engagement and retention so it is an app that students could use even beyond that FYE experience their first year. I would love to use that app for our specific academic college but if there was an app all students had and each school could tailor the resources available to their students I would absolutely jump on board with that and I think it would be VERY well received by our students from my conversations with them. They want something that is accessible to them but also well-done and not just linking them to the SPEA or IU website.  One final note is it would be AMAZING to have a way to track attendance at events using student IDs. I know a few departments have gotten permission to do so on their own but at my undergrad institution, [IRD], anyone who was hosting an event could request and borrow a \"Q card machine\" and not only could they have students swipe or tap in, but they also could allow students to use \"Q-cash\" on their ID to pay for food or merchandise they were selling or fundraising. But even just the attendance aspect would be very beneficial to reduce wait times having students check-in or sign-in when having a larger or mandatory event.  Had an issue last year. After reading the instructions for setting up by phone to log in; needed help setting up my phone instead of Duo password. The UITS tech was helping said I had to go through UITS. While on hold, he was doing something, my coworker said to hand up and he would show me how to set it up. Got it figured out.  The IT staff at the IUHC in Bloomington is great. I really haven't had any interaction w/ UITS, but my colleagues have.  UITS has always been prompt and have always been able to solve any tech problems I have had.  I have had mostly positive experiences dealing with UITS. My only concern is the lengthy SSSP process. It takes quite a while to get something approved for that.  I have nothing bad to say!  Box is showing its age and clunkiness. I now have more than 14 pages of boxes with thousands of documents in them, making it difficult to use.  I have only had positive experiences when using UITS for help.  I think the UITS staff is great, when I have problems they always make it a priority to help, even when it is not a priority.  During the past year, I believe I've interacted with UITS staff twice. I don't remember the specifics of the first encounter, which leads me to believe the experience was neither horrid nor fantastic. The second experience was replacing my login token at the Wells library. The service was quick and painless, but the wait was longer than I expected.  The times that I have called UITS or emailed them, UITS never responded.  I have experienced quite a few issues with Mac laptop and associated printing services, as well as with Skype for Business. Ongoing issues, and all of this took over a couple months to resolve (Skype not yet resolved). That said, my College IT representative works diligently and consistently with campus ITS to resolve issues as best and as quickly as he us able.  They have been very responsive and flexible.  I got to work with Mickie in Athletics. She is wonderful and set up my computer and phone so quickly.  UITS has always been responsive and I'm satisfied with the great customer service. For some of the issues the responses went on an online blog and I'm not sure I like it (seeing myself in a public forum) but I can see how it might be useful to people troubleshooting issues. I believe this was just related to website matters. The last issue I had was not published.  I have almost always had great response times and help from UITS.  Overall, UITS is really helpful and responsive. I'm an advisor on campus and work with tech all day long. I know that if I ever have an issue that I can contact UITS and they will be patient (despite likely getting trivial questions regularly!) and helpful. From the instructor standpoint (I also teach on campus), I find classroom tech to be less intuitive, but I have not taken as much time to learn those functions.  No  All interactions I've had with the IT department at the Library (in particular Keith Welch) has been prompt and very helpful.  I can add, though, that I work from home many days, and when we have Zoom meetings in BL-LIBG- E174 the audio is often so bad (crackling, too quiet, feedback) that it can make it very difficult to hear what's happening in those meetings.  The IT specialist in Bryan Hall are all very helpful and knowledgeable regarding any issues that I might have with computing. My personal concern are hackers and criminals that seem to be finding more innovative methods to trick people.  I recommend allowing ATT to broadcast their Wi-Fi on the campus again. It was convenient to have and no announcements were made before getting rid of it.  UITS can be delayed in responses which can be an issue at times.  Only positive interactions.  Great training tools. Enjoyed discount subscriptions to Plural Sight. I miss free subscription to lynda.com though.  My interactions with UITS have been minimal, but I can say that the one experience I have had with the Support Center--when I picked up my Duo Token--was easy and pleasant. I was impressed that, despite the line of people behind whom I waited, the staff moved thorough their schedule efficiently and still had plenty of positive words and energy left for me when my turn came. Whatever they were doing at that Center that day, it was working.  The UITS staff is quick to respond to any requests and suggesting different ways to implement the task at hand.  UITS staff is always very polite and helpful.  Tech support in my building R/TV is very thoughtful and often even caring.  I often call the support folk at 56789 and have been impressed with their knowledge and helpful advice.  All my experiences have been positive.  The whole campus uses smart card readers for access. Kuali uses a mag stripe reader still, why can't we figure out a way to use the schlage readers with this software. I have provided a reader, I think would work, to our IT department but he says it won't work. The mag stripe wares out to fast.  As a supervisor at a branch library, it would be good to know when they will not have staff in the library to help patrons with printer/copier-related problems. We rely on the UITS consultants in order to help patrons with the myriad printer problems that arise throughout the day. So when they will not have someone here because of sick staff, change in schedule, etc., we really need to know.  Thankfully, I do not need to call upon UITS services very often, but when I do, the representatives are quite helpful.  Overall good support. Recent confusion about what shows in UITS notices when a system is down and a problem has been reported.  My experiences and interactions with UITS is very limited. Therefore, I do not have strong negative or positive interaction with UITS.  I really miss Lynda.com for online learning at my own pace. It's great to have course opportunities offered through UITS but if a scheduling conflict comes up at work then the course is the first to go.  My experience has always been positive. As a new IU staff, November 2018. I have had plenty of contact with the UITS. Always informative and always professional.  Confusion about where to go for what when it comes to technology concerns.  IIDC has received great support for from UITS when it comes to onsite issues however, offsite is a bit of a different issue for us. Many of our end users travel all over the state or have home offices therefor they are not always on the IU network. Typically information is given out with the assumption that users are on the IU network and or admins of their own computers for us this is not typically the case. This causes us great challenges in providing remote user and endpoint support.  Help desk is always extremely helpful in solving issues.  UITS has always been great help to me.  Forgot CISCO password to open encrypted messages had to contact UITS for help. Response was very positive.  I have no concerns.  In general, UITS staff provide excellent service when it comes to Windows, OSX, and mobile devices. My work at IU requires that I develop in a Linux environment however. While I'm able to administer my laptop for the most part, occasionally issues come up that are beyond my expertise. As an example - a recent UITS update to the VPN server software obsoleted my vpn client I had installed (incidentally, software that the knowledge base -still- recommends as a valid VP client - Open Connect). It took about 5 days to resolve the issue and only happened out of lucky happenstance - a technician at the Wells UITS support desk happened to be one of the tier 2 support staff and was finally able to sit down and resolve the issue with me.  I realize that I probably comprise less than 1% of the users at IU (as a Linux user) but it still is frustrating not being able to get timely support for these occasional issues. I lost a week of work as I needed to be home those days but was unable to connect to IU's network. Having a dedicated Linux support desk (I'd happily travel to some location on campus for this) or phone number would be a large step in providing better support to Linux users.  I've had great response times and members following up on concerns I've expressed when the email chain has gone silent. Overall, I'm impressed and satisfied.  I have received help from UITS staff in Wells Library and was satisfied with the help I received. I have also used Knowledge Base.  UITS does a pretty good job : )  The phone system is in no way useful for any office that receives a number of customer service calls. The phone often doesn't ring until the caller has heard several rings (making them impatient). Also, coworkers cannot pick up a call from their desk if the person at the main number is away. Also, I worked with telecommunications for over two months before I gave up on being able to hear my voice mails. For times when I cannot make out the voice to text message, I need to be able to hear the message. I don't have speakers on my computer, but even if I did, I am in too open of an office to play the message out loud.  No complaints, and all of the individuals I have worked with have been very professional and friendly, including student, staff, and faculty representatives.  I am currently trying to get assistance in regards to hosting a podcast via IU resources but it seems like we have already sunset the add-on that would have been used.  My interactions with UITS staff have been positive. They are quick to respond, and very friendly in their interactions. They ask good informative questions.  My office currently has one of the slowest wired internet connections on campus. It would be great if we could get upgraded to the same level as the rest of the School of Public Health building.  I feel that as an overall feel UITS service managers and their technical decision makers do not consider or vet the repercussions of their decisions. Changes are made that seem like little regard to timing, communication, effects on academics or auxiliary units. There have been several times in the last couple of years that changes are launched with little or no time to prepare for rollout or aren't communicated at all. This leaves IT departments frantic with providing a fix and loads of unplanned work.  UITS engagement with the university as a whole seems pretty terrible. Community partnerships does a great job with what they do but many of the other core service providers seem to not have much if any engagement with the customers they service.  Telecomm is woefully understaffed and undertrained in customer service. They don't close tickets or get back about support issues. They don't know how to accurately provide training for how to use the new phones. The new phone system rollout has been the most atrociously rolled out project I've seen in a long time.  I've found that Tier2 has gotten better over time at answering questions or moving along tickets to the correct service provider.  Most staff interactions are very positive. One change that needs to be made is for users to have the ability to accept upgrades for programming they are already approved for on their systems.  Only problem is random arrangement of icons/navigation on One.iu.edu landing page. I wish there were a way to order them--alphabetically would be ideal. And maybe some clue as to what some of the icons mean.  The UITS staff is very helpful anytime I call!!!  UITS is always great about taking care of problems, they do a good job of working with me and my staff to solve the problems and teach us how to continue in the future. My biggest complaint is the timeliness of the services provided. Sometimes, I will not get a follow-up email until nearly a week later. We often have to call and get it expedited. Since we are a service-oriented department, we cannot always wait a week to move equipment, solve technology problems. I think it would be good if a triage system to analyze more prominent needs, that would be extremely helpful.  The copy machines that UITS provides for the students to use doesn't hold enough paper in the paper trays. There should be at least 1 tray that can hold more than one ream of paper. Filling it up repeated times is tiresome. The copy machine in Merrill Hall - Clouse Lounge does not connect to laptops, tablets or the computer that is provided for them to use all the time. This is frustrating to the students and faculty who want to print something using that particular copy machine.  My interactions with the STC group is always great. Also with the CTS folks. They respond promptly to my request or questions and are always pleasant to work with.  The handful of times that I've needed to visit the support center in Wells have been great experiences too. The consultants were kind, courteous and able to help me with my issues.  The Knowledge Base is an awesome tool.  Whenever issues come up with iGPS or Adrx, they seem to always address them in a timely manner. I have not had any negative interactions with UITS.  Pop up's from Adobe all the time get old and pop up's about new software that I am not to install only UITS can.  UITS did a GREAT JOB getting us hooked up to the network as we relocated to an out-building during renovation of our regular building.  I work a lot with systems that UITS maintains and for the vast majority of the time they work flawlessly. If there is ever an issue, UITS seems to take the concerns, or problems, very seriously and addresses them promptly. From what I can tell, UITS does a fantastic job keeping us up and running.  No recommendations.  UTIS has always been very helpful and quick to respond.  I am relatively new and have only had a few interactions with UITS, but all have been positive experiences.  Positive experiences with classroom teaching stations and tech support.  My experience with UITS services is very good. Always patient and helpful.  I am always amazed at how much a UITS staff person has to know in order to provide satisfactory service to so many people, and for varied products and issues. I seldom encounter someone who can't help me with my issue.  My biggest ongoing issue is Outlook. I am constantly rebooting my computer to keep Outlook working properly. It is the one software I can't do without and it is the one that gives me problems daily. It freezes constantly, can link to the internet, loses emails I am in the middle of writing and more. Wish it were more dependable.  I love One.IU and really like the IU secure access on campus. SIS is a dinosaur as is the employee center, it's time for an upgrade.  Not sure what all UITS extends to. Most of my daily interactions are with IUB Libraries discovery services such as Media Collections Online (MCO). The cataloging interface for MCO could stand to have some fields added for contributor roles, catalog and matrix numbers, generating reports of what's been pushed from the Dark Avalon database to MCO, etc. but seems fine for the most part.  Maybe something to improve existing service support would be having people on staff who are knowledgeable on Adobe Creative Suite troubleshooting.  The UITS staff is very knowledgeable and are highly intelligent. I wish communication was a little better in some of the projects I've worked on, but I think that is specific to particular projects.  I haven't had many encounters with the UITS, but the one time that I did have, they were very helpful to get me the right information and point me in the correct direction.  I have limited interaction with UITS, but the few times that we have connected, it was very professional and extremely knowledgeable. Very happy with the services provided.  Positive: quick response times and excellent service approach.  1.)        Statewide was great this year! I hadn't been in a few years and I really enjoyed it.  2.)        I wish there was more notice when your computer is updated. Either send an email out before or after the update to let you know what's happening. The transparency would be greatly appreciated!  I have not used computers much before I started working for IU, but ones I have used are extremely slow compared to IU's.  I have not had direct contact with UITS for over five years. Now that we have an in house IT department, any technical problems are handled by them.  Seems there are too many systems that do not report to each other. Recorders enter in one system, advisors in another. Some systems AdRx, SIS, have glitches that seemed to be unsolvable last semester, particularly the removal of V03 holds that were not sticking. I reported it multiple times last semester and eventually had to give up because of lag time and registration. It came to a point where it was not fair for me to have a student wait for it to be investigated. I just had to redo the removals.  UITS staff have been very helpful to me when having issues with IU Secure access. They have also been helpful in getting Building Services staff the duo token & up until they changed their hours made it convenient for 3rd shift employees to get their Crimson Cards. They need to have at least 1 night a week they are available for us to get Crimson Cards.  It appears to me that, in our department, concerns about security have become the only yardstick. My guess is that this is driven by university policy.  I have had nothing but positive interactions with UITS.  My experience with UITS is always positive. The crew is friendly and efficient. They are thorough in their troubleshooting.  We are currently transitioning to a data storage setup on the big data capacitor. IT has not been particularly helpful here. Every few months we check in on their progress and they are still at the same spot. It is unclear if anyone actually works on the project or if they only thinking about it when we bring it up. What was supposed to be online a year ago is no closer to completion. Again, this was supposed to be done quite some time ago.  AdAstra is a terrible scheduling system.  No concerns  Started in current role January 2019 so experiences are limited.  Positive experiences with OTP token support staff.  Yes. At one time my CAS login into the system \"remembered\" my user name and password. That made logging in very easy, but still secure since I had to enter a code from my token. It has since switched back to needing the username password requirement, and now saves my token code for 7 days. I would love to see this work remembering my name and password because it made logging into the CAS much less involved.  Downloading the Adobe software at the start of the year wasn't clear to me. It took me awhile to figure it out and I couldn't find an answer! I think the process has changed from the year before and it wasn't clearly explained anywhere.  Overall my experiences with UITS have been very positive.  I rely on UTIS a great deal.  I would like to learn more about various IT processes on campus, but I am really busy with my job, so I will have to bypass participation.  The only thing that is really weird is that each UITS group can only help certain tech things. It would be great if they (UITS) could do all types of tech help for all devices. For example, I have to take my phone to the other UITS team in the union. Why? As an executive, shouldn't we just have all of our computer devices serviced by the same team? Also, there is confusion over which UITS group works with which executives. That's just really odd. I have had very wonderful work with the EITS team. They are helpful, responsive and go out of their way to assist me. They are also responsive when I am traveling or on another campus, I ask for directions on how to do something and they always assist me in a timely manner.  So far all the UITS staff I have interacted with are very good. The services I used are good as well except the Exchange server. We have several users in the school who experienced some problems using Exchange service with non-Outlook email clients such as Thunderbird or Pine.  Great people to work with.  When I returned to the university most recently for employment, I experienced an issue accessing email with my smartphone. I checked the website tutorials first, which are written well and easy to follow. This did not resolve my issue. I proceeded to the Learning Commons where they just followed the tutorials I had already tried. I did preface our exchange with the fact that I had followed everything on the knowledge base, but in typical fashion we had to run through all of it again to no avail. The only useful part of going to the Learning Commons was that the issue was logged, so when I emailed UITS for a resolution to my issue, I could reference the earlier interaction. Eventually, everything was resolved, but it did take some time. I feel as though the Learning Commons could have been bypassed, chances are in the future I will look to do so because I can follow a knowledge base article. I feel as though the Learning Commons is more for people without any practical experience.  I'm always happy with the service I get when I call the knowledge base.  I am frequently struck by the over-representation of men who work the UITS tech desk on the first floor of wells library and on the 4th floor plotter printers and 3D printing labs.  I have found the live chat to be a very useful and effective means of communication and obtaining quick answers.  Many of the question do not apply.  Typically UITS online KB is a great resource and when its confusing, staff is easy to reach. I love the chat feature as it's very convenient and typically it is quick troubleshooting.  I have had nothing but good experiences with UITS staff/services.  UITS has always been helpful for me, both as an undergraduate student and a member of staff. They are knowledgeable, kind, and helpful. I also love the hold music y'all play when I call the 5-6789 number.  I have been able to call UITs for technical help.  When needed, I have always been able to have any problem solved by UITS staff.  My office has a memorandum of agreement with TechSelect and their staff goes above and beyond to assist our office with new resource requests, trouble shooting, etc. They are very friendly and very knowledgeable.  The support has always been and continues to be superb.  I have worked with UITS several times and have had very good experiences each time.  All my interactions with UITS have been pleasant and helpful.  Job aides needed for more in-depth aspects of peoplesoft/SIS.  Everyone has been very helpful.  An IT chat room might be a good idea. The chat can have a few UITS staff in it to field questions. Others in the chat can also share their experiences.  I have had many positive experiences with UITS.  Positive experiences with all of the staff.  I only interact with the tech staff (KSBIT) at Kelley. They are great!  Whenever I have had to deal with UITS on any occasion, the response has been very good and the staff has been excellent.  Overall, I feel UITS does a good job.  It's great to know you are available when problems arise.  I have had many wonderful positive experiences with our Music IT staff at Jacobs School of Music. They are always so patient and helpful, and take care of the problems we are experiencing.  Really pretty much everything I need for my job is available and works well. Thank you. The Microsoft Outlook mobile app has not been allowed for a really long time now though. There must be a fix?  Development resources to assist a department to improve service and efficiency of its applications is very limited. Governance of development resources seem closed and rigid. The ability to leverage central systems, to avoid redundant expenditure of reporting and development resources and to tailor applications at point of sale/delivery very limited.  Overall I really appreciate the services UITS provides. People are mostly helpful and dedicated. Exceptions: The Chrome River product selection and rollout was not managed well - end users were not heard and treating patronizing. Too much money is spent on UITS communications - this money comes from assessments paid by schools, schools who do not have funding for communications activity a fraction of the level you provide; you seem tone deaf to this in your delivery of communication tools. IU Anyware rocks. When I call the support center at 7AM on my cell phone to report that the network is down in my building, telling me to contact my local IT Pro since they need to verify that the network and phones are indeed not functional is insulting and not practical. When I call the Support Center to report that an application is down and the consultant tells me that they don't have a record of that since it isn't on the outage notification, it is just mildly annoying.  Here are just a few items:  - Departmental IT staff are still seen as below UITS in skills, knowledge and experience. While OneIT and OneIU are promoted at Statewide and in periodic communications, there still exists a divide. In many cases, departmental IT staff have to deal with a much larger variety of support needs for their customers.  -Denodo  Connections to Denodo are not reliable. Additional work needs to be done to make sure that connections don't drop randomly. There seems to be limited experience with Denodo and how Denodo can be leveraged to meet specific needs for Units outside of UITS.  -Docker  UITS doesn't have specific plans yet around adding windows container support. Departmental IT will need to pave the way again for their own use cases.  -WHE  WHE has no intention of supporting .NET Core2, so Units must spin up their own servers. Docker and Azure are additional choices. Docker container support for Windows is untested. Azure has issues.  Tableau is a good data visualization tool but it is not a good tool for operational report development. Also, if there is any need to develop a report using complex data, it is a very complicated process to model the data within Tableau in order to build a report.  I would like to recommend the University at evaluate Power BI Service (Premium Capacity) as an additional reporting tool. With PBI, report development is very easy even for non-technical users. Another advantage is the ability to triage issues as the steps taken through the data modeling are transparent and easy to evaluate and change unlike triaging an issue within Tableau. As I understand, there a number of other units who are very interested in using and learning more about the PBI Service but to leverage the capabilities, a premium capacity license would be needed.   ### Undergraduate responses:  I went through a chat conversation once because my computer wouldn't connect to the IU secure Wi- Fi. The person was very helpful and resolved my problem quickly.  No concerns as of this moment.  They are helpful.  They set up shortcuts on my personal laptop that made it easier for me to do work from home.  When I have gone to the staff they have always been friendly and helpful.  Great! I go in all the time and they help me right away  I don't have any negative experiences but my friend once went to get help with downloading something and the person helping her wiped her computer, I think it was accidental and she had backed it up a couple days before but still. I also am always having connection issues when I'm sitting in the IMU student tower.  The printer in swain west does not work well at all and is extremely unreliable and slow.  Never had a problem with UITS. They've solved every problem I've gone to them for.  A few months ago, I needed helped with my Apple MacBook. I went to UITS services in Wells library. I don't remember the guy's name that helped me but he knew a lot about what he was doing, and it was overall a positive experience.  Nope  I personally just have issues with IU Secure. As a freshman my Wi-Fi was great and never had issue. Now as a senior, my laptop is randomly kicked off and my phone rarely connects to IU secure. Other than that, UITS has been great in helping me solve non Wi-Fi related issues  As a senior, I think I would have benefitted from tech demos and introduction classes to different tech apps freshman year that I now wish I had learned how to use (i.e. Photoshop).  Some of the printers get jammed and don't get serviced for a long time. The one time I did call to have a printer fixed, no one could get there for at least an hour and I needed to print something for a class that was starting in less than an hour.  UITS staff has been very helpful in the classrooms of professors who are not as knowledgeable about technology. The staff also helped me get a token when my phone broke last year. However, when my little brother was trying to apply for a IU High School Online class, UITS was largely unable to help him and just kept directing him back to the people in charge of the high school courses, who could not figure it out. Having the UITS staff be more educated on certain things IU offers off-campus would be helpful.  They have made it very easy for me to connect devices to IUDEVICENET and download Microsoft Office on my computer.  They helped me with any technical issues I had very promptly.  I have had positive experiences when I am at the library and they help me out with any questions that I have. I have not had any negative experiences other than waiting to be attended to. Other than that, I feel that Wi-Fi on campus is always really spotty and it can become very frustrating at times.  Positive experiences this year.  I have had positive interactions.  They spent 2+ hours with me trying to fix my computer. It was very kind.  UITS services helped me get my duo token set up. It was easy and convenient. I don't have additional recommendations.  I have received fast service, but at times I got lost in the instructions. Perhaps finding ways to more colloquialize common issues you face will improve your perception. I also believe that putting one.iu.edu on the desktop across all computers allows us to work better than by just putting Canvas.  Staff have been very nice but not always helpful at fixing problems.  I really like how the school network system provides us with the most convenient use on campus, easy to access with fast speed. The only problem I've encountered several times was that when I used the online printing webpage to send out a printing request (with money paid) and went to the printer right away, it didn't work as expected.  It would be great if the mobile app for One.IU wasn't just a browser window. It works better for me to just pull it up on my phone's own browser.  One time I could not get a computer in Woodburn to work and had a time sensitive document on the computer that I needed to somehow get off the computer (the screen crashed but so I couldn't see anything but the computer was still running). A UITS employee came out to Woodburn at like 8 PM to help me fix the computer and get my document. He was super helpful.  All of my experience with UITS has been positive. Any time I have had a question or needed assistance, I was able to receive the help I needed.  Usually good at computer problems. Very good with poster printing in Wells.  I haven't had many interactions with staff, but the online services (especially in terms of sites through one.iu) are extremely confusing to access because of the layout.  I think there should be more Ethernet connection points in dorms and on campus apartments.  My main complaint is that on various department sites, login pages for conferences, etcetera, the links don't work, taking me to error messages, dead pages, or simply not taking me anywhere, like the Hip Hop Conference registration page. Also, on some pages, like the reset password pages, you end up going in circles pressing links that take you to pages you've already been.  I have had positive experiences with staff, but the cisco secure messages always give me trouble.  They didn't know how to fix my print problem.  Printing issues. Positive interactions with person on the phone.  At my time here at Indiana University, all my experiences with UITS staff have been very positive. Every time I called or walked up, the staff member was always able to help me answer a question or find a solution to my problem.  UITS was able to fix the issue I had with Duo Mobile at the beginning of the school year, although they weren't sure why I was having the issue.  I'd like improvements to the print system since the printer sometimes fails to print or be recognized. I'm also not sure who to notify about printer error messages.  I had a great experience with UITS when I had an issue with having no funds on my account to print a large assignment and I did not know how to get more funds to print on my account. I was upset and frustrated, but a UITS member talked me through where to locate the website and what I needed to do. I had been very upset but UITS talked me through it and made the process faster and easier.  I have had positive experiences with UITS support. I've gone to them for diagnosing hardware issues, help viewing encrypted emails, and virus protection when my computer froze up.  Most services work pretty well. One.iu can sometimes be hard to find things on. I have interacted with UITS to print plotters and they were very nice. Could work on making it easier to print from normal printers though.  I think UITS does a great job with cybersecurity and I appreciate that there are people set up in the library for help with technology issues.  Mac computers in the fine arts building should be networked to all the photo printers instead of just one computer connecting to each of the six printers. This created so many problems when I had photography classes.  Greatly appreciated the staff who helped me set up the Wi-Fi in my on-campus apartment.  I had trouble with connecting my laptop in the beginning of the semester, so I called a representative and they were very nice and helpful!  The only interaction with UITS support that I can remember is regarding a bunch of spam messages I was continually receiving on my IU email address, and each time I reached out to UITS they only gave me obvious and general suggestions, like marking the messages as spam, not an actual solution to this clear bug in the IU email system. I wish they had been more willing to help or push my problem to a higher level. In terms of technology provided, I really utilize a lot of the various technologies, but overall find myself wishing the design on SSI was much better and easier to understand.  I think the two-step login sometimes was not useful by getting a phone call. I cannot receive a phone call immediately.  Since I'm taking the survey online, PLEASE stop calling me!!!!  UITS staff over the phone is always great! Although sometimes in-person they aren't the most helpful.  Not many interactions. They came to fix a computer while I was peer tutoring for a class and it was a little disruptive but nothing that could be avoided if we wanted the computer fixed for the next class. Not sure if UITS deals with the printers but it seems like they are always broken, or out of ink, or paper jammed.  Most interactions are seamless. Every time I have to call UITS for an issue, the attendant is always knowledgeable and helpful. The computers are sometimes slow to log on at the psych building, and the printer doesn't always print correctly. Specifically, about half the time I print lecture slides from PowerPoint with a black/white scale, not gray scale, they come out gray scale.  Nothing negative.  I have generally had positive interactions and experiences with UITS. I most frequently use the mobile print services, and similarly to how you can download a client to a laptop to print directly from applications (IU mobile print appears as a printer option), I would like to see this option come to a mobile version so I don't have to upload documents onto the mobile print website on my phone. This process works, but it's somewhat cumbersome.  I have only had positive experiences with UITS staff and services.  All interactions I have had with UITS staff have been great. I've had some people help me with technology issues but I have also had people help me with homework and assignments which is very much appreciated and nice.  UITS staff was very helpful when I got a new phone and had to set up duo mobile again.  I had a really hard time figuring out the mobile print process. The online help pages didn't really seem to help. However, every single time I talk to a UITS staff member in person, I have a phenomenal experience! They're very well trained, respectful, and conscientious.  The student center app/program feels so outdated. It's nearly impossible to navigate at times, and it takes me back to the home page after nearly every step, it feels.  All my experiences have been positive.  I was very thankful for the UITS help I received.  I have only had good experiences with UITS staff and services.  My computer crashed freshman year and UITS was able to help me recover as much as possible. They've also been helpful with any software download malfunctions I've had over the years.  I have gone to the UITS help center twice for issues that I have had with Canvas and One.iu on my laptop and they were very helpful and patient both times.  I haven't had much need for the staff, but the services are pretty simple, direct, and easy to follow.  They are extremely helpful at the library when I needed to print a large sign for a class.  The computers in the forest computer lab seem to stutter occasionally.  The staff is quick to help if there are any problems and seem patient via email :-) I am an ACP instructor so not on campus to use facilities.  I am an online master's student and have no IU resources beyond online.  I do not like Canvas, I don't find it as user friendly as Google Classroom that we use at the school corporation I teach at.  I do find that when I have had to get help from IU for myself or my students, they are very helpful  Any time I have had to have a UITS staff member help me, they have been very kind and helpful. The services are also extremely easy to use and are very helpful as well.  For myself, I don't feel like it's clear where to stand and get help. I was with a group of people just in a big pile waiting for help!  I like the experience I had with UITS.  Every experience I have had with UITS has been positive thus far. I have had many technological questions that they have always answered full and well.  With all of my interactions thus far with UITS I have had an easy and seamless experience to get in and get out which is all I need.  I have only had positive experiences. They helped me figure out how to get Word on my computer, and I have heard from a friend that they helped her when she had a virus!  Two step verify/Duo Mobile should be revoked or made optional. Students who come from a less privileged socio-economic background are made to feel outcast due to their lack of cell phone. Those who have a cell phone often experience problems using the technology and it wastes time. If a student does not feel the extra verification is necessary to access their accounts there should be an option to not have it.  I have not had to ask for help from UITS staff recently, but have had positive experiences in the past. I have always gone to the desk at Wells, and my only concern is that sometimes there have been very long waits.  The thing that always frustrates me is some of the hardware at IU, specifically the printers and some of the desktops. The printers often will go down and IUPrintMobile does not cooperate and let me login about once a week. The desktop computers in the SPEA/Business Commons are also very slow and take a substantial amount of time to login.  UITS is usually very helpful and kind.  When it comes to technology, I believe it's very efficient. I've never run into any problems when using the computers. When it comes to service, from what I have experienced in the past UITS has been very patient with me and it felt like they wanted to help rather than feeling like an inconvenience.  All my UITS experiences have been pretty good.  They always help.  UITS staff have always been friendly and helpful no matter what the problem is.  All my experiences have been positive. They have helped me clear cookies and fix my Wi-Fi problem.  There should be an easier way to log in to one.iu instead of duo.  I have only had good experiences with both the UITS staff and its services.  I have had several encounters with UITS staff because of printing and they were very helpful and kind. That being said, I wish that the printing system at IU could be improved. There typically are not enough computers on campus to sign on and directly send documents to the printer, so being able to send documents to the printer via email and through the mobile print upload, but this often does not work very accurately, such as documents disappear once you actually sign in on the printers, you'll release a print and it won't actually physically come out but will disappear from the task list, and sometimes the emails to the printer or mobile upload doesn't even go through.  This past semester my hard drive on my Mac needed to be replaced. I was not sure what was wrong with it, but when I took my laptop to UITS, they referred me to MacExperience and my hard drive was replaced by the end of the week!  Overall, I have had no major issues with the technology services on campus and am largely satisfied with them.  I think that downloading Word should be easier and that the Wi-Fi at the IMU needs to be fixed.  Receiving emails through both Outlook/Exchange vs. Gmail can be frustrating, having to check both emails at times.  Every service experience that I have had with UITS has been positive. The printers at SPEA need to be serviced often, so I think another printer available to students would be most helpful.  No.  I really like the chat service offered from UITS, and the live consultants helped me out a lot. I just wish the chat service was easier to get to.  They were incredibly helpful and quick to find the solution.  I have not had much experience working with the UITS department  Usually it's good and everything works perfectly fine.  No concerns/recommendations.  I am satisfied with UITS services.  No  I think UITS is very useful when you don't know how to do something on the computer. Also when something isn't working they help.  Goods:  Concerns  In my experience, UITS has a great support staff. They are prompt, kind and knowledgeable. I do not have many issues with IU software. I would say the one area for improvement is one.iu, and the Student Center. They are old, and somewhat confusing sites.  The most frustrating software is the IU mobile app. On multiple occasions I have tried to login to the app, been prompted to input a verification code, and then been prompted to login again, ad nauseum. I ended up not being able to access my IU mobile app at all and gave up.  I've always been impressed with how available tech services were when I needed assistance. They always showed that they had a high level of expertise in the area.  I have only had positive experiences with UITS.  UITS staff is generally friendly and helpful. I tend to have issues with the school Wi-Fi, however. There are also times when the mobile print site does not work.  They are the hardest working employees at IU. I've had excellent service while printing from the plotters on the 4th floor of the library. I think that should be staffed in more locations so that they are easier to access. There never seems to be enough employees around to help in certain labs.  I brought my laptop to the UITS area in Wells Library and the man that helped me erased the viruses off of my computer and showed me how to check for viruses and keep my computer protected. He was very nice and knowledgeable.  I am on the UITS live chat frequently and often the person isn't very helpful or tells me they can't do anything to fix the problem unless I have a staff member, multiple students, etc. contact them.  I have had few interactions with staff, but none have been negative.  Nope.  There was a long line when I had a computer Microsoft Word question.  I have had issues with iu anyware. It is not as user friendly as the downloaded application and tends to freeze or shut down often. Every time I have called or messaged for help I have received good assistance.  No issues. You guys are great and the technology and service is wonderful.  I think that they are very friendly and helpful. I have no concerns or negative interactions. I don't have any recommendations.  It's nice that you can call someone late into the night if you're ever having a problem.  No negative interactions at all. The two times I used IUTS services I got the answers I needed and I was satisfied with the process. No recommendations, just positive feedback.  They helped me get my DUO login working when I was in Costa Rica.  My experience with UITS staff and services has been pretty positive.  The UITS staff at IUB Wells is great. I've never had a problem they can't solve. I really like the online help.  UITS has always been the best help for setting up my devices on campus.  When I first moved into my apartment I had to wait almost a week for a UITS staff member to come and register my router. So I couldn't do anything for a week and it was very inconvenient, I would have preferred a way that I could have registered my router on my own so that I could get work done.  I like how there is always someone to assist me when I needed help. Although it is convenient, it doesn't specify or direct other resources that are not able to address with UITS.  Depends on who you get on the phone, some are very knowledgeable and some are not. Those that are not claim to help but make stuff worse when they could just pass the issue on to the next representative.  There was connectivity issues while on campus taking this eval. the error message was as follows: Connection Error. We were unable to connect to our servers. Please check your internet connection and try again. #B.2xmitiw.jrwbval1  The printers are normally the largest problem on campus. They are slow and often times do not work all together.  Only worked with them once, they were helpful with what I needed.  The only issue I have had is after sending something to print it not showing up on my card the first time. I often have to go and hit print again before it will show up.  Great research and services. More is always the answer to these surveys.  Every time I've had an issue they are quick to respond and have never failed to help me identify and solve the technological problem at hand. The instant chat service has been beautifully efficient and I hope you guys continue to run smoothly.  I haven't had any negative experiences, but have been promptly helped by them in the past and appreciate it!  Every experience I've had with UITS has been positive. They address and understand my concerns or questions, and help me solve any issues in a timely manner.  The only negative experience I have had is that the internet in the Union Street apartments is very spotty.  I have no concerns with the UITS staff.  Only been there once, no negative interactions.  The UITS staff has been extremely helpful to me, helping me with problems on my computer. The service is fine because they are available all throughout the day.  Very helpful  I've neither had concerns nor particularly good experiences.  Earlier in the school year, I had several problems with my apps downloaded from IUware. The UITS staff at the IMU was very helpful and walked me through the process of deleting my Microsoft office and redownloading. I did not have any negative interactions.  I especially appreciated how the staff member didn't know exactly how to do it but was able to look it up online and follow the instructions, which I know I couldn't have understood by myself.  I have had positive experiences with UITS. They have helped me with several different computer issues I have had over the course of my time at IU.  They helped me fix my computer and find software that I needed for class. I like the services; I wouldn't change a thing.  Give uits funding back so they can hire me.  I have never used UITS services.  I have had UITS staff help with email problems in the past when we switched from umail.iu.edu to iu.edu. Their responses were prompt and helpful.  They have always been very helpful to me.  They've helped out a lot when it comes to navigating box and providing us with research tools for projects  FIX IU MOBILE. WHY CANT I SAVE MY LOGIN INFO SO I DON'T HAVE TO RETYPE IT EVERY TIME. Also the gmail never loads (at least for me). The duo mobile logs me out half the time when I go to accept the push notification and I have to repeat the process. Also my gmail occasionally saves emails to drafts instead of sending them, after I press send and it says that I sent it.  I have only had one experience with UITS and it was great. The motherboard in my computer stopped working and they were able to diagnose it and let me know what the problem was.  No  I have had great experiences with UITS.  I have an overall positive experience receiving help from the UITS staff throughout my college career.  How do I get a job with you guys ha-ha  There are times when One.IU crashes, but overall good quality.  I had a hardware problem and they made me wipe my computer. I was sad but I eventually sent it in and got it fixed.  A few weeks ago I called UITS because a file got corrupted and I wanted to try to recover it. The guy who answered just told me that if it wasn't in \"Open recent\" then it was lost and there was nothing else to do. I'm not upset that he couldn't help me recover the file, but doing a quick google search gave me a dozen more suggestions than he did. I'm not sure these guys are actually very knowledgeable about tech.  More printer paper.  When I have any issues they are readily available to help.  I have had good experiences with UITS staff and services. My only concern is that they charge for some services, such as helping with bootcamping a computer, which discourages students from using the services. Also, I'm not sure if this is under UITS control, but the scheduling system for IU could be improved and easier to use.  I have not had any experiences with UITS so far.  Every time I go to their office they always find a way to help even when they do not have time.  Assistants are nice.  There was once I had a problem with duo service. I left my old phone back in my country and was using a new one. I received a token from the UITS and I thought the service is good and not as complex as I thought.  Last year when I went abroad, I had issues accessing my IU email because my dual login hadn't been properly setup. I had to Skype with someone from UITS and they were extremely helpful in helping me to fix my problem with my email, despite not being in the country.  I would like to see Microsoft project added to the software available to students.  I currently work at UITS as a Technology Center Consultant. I have been able to help students with multiple different problems and cant seem to find any negative interactions I can think about right now.  Good  They helped me set up my printing when it wasn't working!  When I had a problem with opening an e-mail, a staff at Wells Library was willing to help me. Sometimes, copy machines don't work well and I get error messages.  I don't like the call to push notification to get into canvas. I lost my phone last semester and had no way to log into my canvas for two weeks. I eventually had to call UITS and have them help me with duo.  They were very helpful. I'm just not a fan of the log in.  I have only had positive experiences with UITS. I have only used UITS a handful of times, and each time they have solved my issue quickly and properly.  All staff I've interacted with have been really nice and usually respond/fix things quickly.  So far, I only had positive experiences with UITS staffs/services. They were really nice and helpful when I had technical issues with my laptop or software. I couldn't think of any recommendations, except just continue doing their best at servicing or helping others. As for the online services, it has been good so far, only sometimes they are some issues related to the webpage.  I have always had positive interactions with staff. There was a time when the printer was out of black toner for a day which was frustrating, but all other issues have been fixed timely.  I wish the Wi-Fi system can be updated...sometimes it just fails in the dorm.  Wi-Fi goes out all the time on campus. It is very spotty and annoying. UITS staff and services are wonderful but can do nothing about the lack of Wi-Fi connection in places on this campus. Please improve Wi-Fi connection for the sake of all kids who cannot afford data.  Everyone and every service is awesome. When I have any problem, they help me as quick as possible.  I am concerned about the inaccessibility of Iuware.  I have used UITS enough to have a good opinion on them.  All positive interactions.  The IU Wi-Fi networks are almost unusable for me unless I am physically in a building, even if I am on campus.  I went to UITS three times the past year. Each time the staff was very helpful and genuinely cared to fix the issue I had with my electronic device. I had some bug fixes on my laptop a few times that I needed to resolve. There was also a problem with my headphone jack that was resolved quickly. I had some issues with my cell phone and IU Secure that they helped out with too.  UITS has helped me with printing and computer issues multiple times throughout my years here at IU. No negative interactions nor concerns.  UITS staff is always calm and courteous. I am never afraid to contact them.  I have not had any bad experiences with the staff/service.  Computer services for broken computers not just technology issues.  I do not have any concerns.  Nothing really stands out.  I feel the IU community has fulfilled their promise. The staff here are very nice and helpful. It just at times in the library, I don't know who to ask for the books.  All positive stuff, very helpful.  All good experiences. The services are available at great hours and everyone gets back fast.  Were very patient and friendly.  It is easy to access. But the Duo system is kind of annoying as we are required to type such long passphrase to log in.  I called UITS for help with connecting my Roku to IU Secure and the person who did so was very helpful and nice. This was a few months ago, I never really utilized UITS on my own because I didn't know what all they could do for me.  IU Secure network is very poor and rarely works properly with my IPhone even when I am in my room or most places on campus. I don't know if that's because I need an upgrade because my phone is older or just a connection issue in general. IU Secure also doesn't automatically connect to my MacBook. I have to manually get on it every time. My MacBook automatically tries to get on IU DeviceNet or IU Guest.  I have not had to use the UTIS staff or services before so I do not have an opinion. The only thing that I can think of is the IU Wi-Fi is terrible to connect to.  So far I have had no complaints. The staff have been very helpful in anything I needed help with. Keep up the good work!  I took an old laptop in that I thought would not be able to function again due to the viruses and large amount of files left on it. However, the person who helped me took the time to wipe the unnecessary files and clear the virus. They also educated me on the safest way to protect my information.  No problem. I got the help I needed every time.  Any issue I've came to UITS with has been solved in good time. I've had no problems.  For inquiring incoming freshman making your overall website much easier to use and much more direct and simple.  I have no recommendations at this time.  I think UITS is great. Whenever I had an issue they always helped me fix the problem in a timely way.  I have gotten help with malfunctions with IUsecure and had a good experience.  UITS has always helped me regarding any technical issue. The services they provide are adequate and they should keep up their work.  -           Excellent Wi-Fi all around campus.  -           Sometimes printing doesn't work.  In my experience UITS staff have always been prompt in addressing any technical difficulties my friends and I have had.  I like the staff's help and the website provides a lot of information.  I have not had too many interactions with UITS staff. I have emailed them before, I believe, about a problem which they quickly responded to and helped me find a solution.  Positive: many of the lab classes have IT that can help with computer problems. Many resources with information about technology services. Negative: WIFI problems, Wi-Fi many times asks for login and password.  Poor Wi-Fi connection.  I really like that you can find everything through one.iu.edu, including Canvas and email. I have never been able to figure out how to go to gmail.com and log in to my IU account through the gmail log in screen.  Great experiences! Very helpful and quick.  The UITS staff at Wells Library has been very helpful in solving a lot of the technical problems that I've had with my computer. They're also pretty quick to fix computers or printers that aren't working. I usually never see a printer that is out of service for more than 2 days in a row.  I really like the myprintcenter website and I use it for all of the things that I want to print; however, there are some instances where the website is extremely slow to the point where the files that I upload get timed out. There are also one or two cases where the printer took a long time to print from myprintcenter. It would be nice if that process could be more efficient.  No concerns. Very helpful people and know what they are doing.  I have had all positive experiences with them.  '- The staff is typically always friendly and seems very dedicated to solving your issues. They care and put their attention all on you. Smiling goes a long way, which they do often (at least my experience).  - I do not like the email I receive about an open ticket. It is very confusing to read/reply. Not sure if it's going to a human or not. The email for an open-ticket should be overhauled to be simple and easy to ready. There's too much information on it currently.  I have nothing to say but positives things.  Sometimes the services will shut down for a while. That is annoying me a lot.  All good interactions.  I think that the UITS staff is currently operating efficiently.  Mostly tech bar stuff at the library. Always been helpful.  Registering for classes is confusing. At orientation someone just had to do it for me- it was too complicated to teach.  One.iu is navigable, but just barely. You have to know EXACTLY what you're looking for.  Wi-Fi likes to cut out or run slowly. The online classrooms are fine, but not enjoyable- (although maybe the classes just took advantage of their online environment poorly).  Room for improvement, but UITS meets the baseline requirements. Your tech help services are STELLAR though.  The UITS help desk at Wells library has too long of a wait. While this could be an incredibly helpful resource, I have had times where I cannot wait in line and have to find alternate help sources (online videos, company product support, Geek Squad, etc.).  I love the availability of printers all around campus but sometimes mobile print center doesn't work with my computer. Also I know the double login makes things secure but it is SOOOOO annoying.  UITS has been good. I don't know if it's run through UITS, but the support for the Linux computing infrastructure (silo, etc.) has been really helpful.  I was not happy to find that our wireless display to TV system does not support Linux.  Sometimes the printers have some problem where people can't login to their accounts and print their documents.  All outstanding. No recommendations.  Based on my personal experience, when I contacted UITS services for live chat it felt like I was talking to a professional company's services. They were patient and informative. The conversation we had showed their humbleness and their willingness to assist.  I do not.  Last year when I had internet and computer issues I got help from the UITS help center and the staff there were very friendly and helpful, quickly resolving my issues.  The fact that IU eTexts won't let you highlight text (for the sake of copying and pasting) without creating a study-style highlight (as in yellow as if highlighted with a marker), and the fact that you can't delete the highlight without clicking on it, manually deleting it, and waiting for the prompt to disappear from the screen, is bad and embarrassing. That's the single worst thing about any IU technology with the exception of Student Center.  I have had all good experiences with UTIS staff. They have helped me print papers when it was 3:00 AM at the library and it wouldn't work. They have helped me copy something on a printer. The staff is always very kind and helpful.  IU printing is terrible, why do I need to go through two different sites to find a printer and actually print when the name of the printer isn't even on the printer.  As a sophomore, I have used these services nearly every day for the last two years. So far in these two years I have had no issues at all. Everything is simple, easy, and help is easy to get when needed.  None  Thank you for all the effort you guys put in. The only problem I have faced is that One.IU tends to hang a lot on the Safari Browser for some reason, other than that everything works well for me as a student.  They are helpful when I need.  Good information, don't really use the service because there are not many issues.  Anytime I have needed assistance from UITS, their responses have been very timely and helpful.  Give the option to secure a device for duo login for longer than 7 days. Duo login is a great security system, but it makes it inconvenient when I have to use it every seven days when I log in on my home computer.  Very smooth and user-friendly.  Duo log in is seriously annoying especially because not everyone always has their phone on them.  I had someone come and set up my Wi-Fi and it was done very well and professionally.  UITS staff has always been very helpful and kind.  I do not have any concerns.  I have no concerns on the technological services at IU. The staff had been very helpful to me and the technology is running smoothly.  I would like to make a suggestion regarding the Canvas's to-do list. Since it doesn't show all the assignments, students might miss their assignments resulting in a lower grade. That is something that I would say that UITS should work on. Other than that I love everything that UITS has to provide!  I've had great experiences with UITS. They are always available and very friendly. 24/7 is great especially when you have an issue late at night.  I think UITS should work on a better way to authenticate your account when you don't have access to a phone.  I had a great experience with UITS, the only thing I would change is adding printers to more convenient locations.  I had issue getting Microsoft Suite on to my computer, so UITS was able to do it for me. They were very helpful.  I haven't had much experience with the staff. The negative things that I've experienced technology related, I'm not sure if it's this same department. For example, sometimes the professor runs out of batteries and the offices won't give them one, saying it's not their responsibility...it's all IU, it should be their responsibility. Also, it's frustrating that SciFi only works on campus.  UITS staff are always very friendly when I approach them with my technical problems. I have not had one bad experience yet.  It is difficult finding things on one.iu.edu if you do not know the EXACT label for the pin you are looking for. There is also not much instruction on how to navigate through this.  No comment  I have no complaints about UITS.  They have always been very helpful.  I would like to comment on Duo Two Authenticator. When UITS did not have this, life was better. I love the Google Gmail IU interface now, but sometimes it messes up  Overall, I think UITS helps me a lot. But, sometime there are bugs in Canvas. I still remember, because of the Canvas bug, I cannot upload my assignment and it makes me so stressful.  The staff is always helpful and very patient.  No  UITS Staff has always been very helpful with any technology needs.  I have had a really positive experience. I am not technologically savvy and the employees are very helpful.  I have not had any experiences with UITS staff.  The UTIS staff has always been more than willing to help and extremely informational.  During the email migration, several important questions were left unanswered, and the informational emails only ever repeated the same information without answering anything new. Nothing on the links answered certain questions either. For example, I remember trying to figure out if .indiana.edu could still be used or if it had to be .iu.edu. Nowhere was it made clear that .indiana.edu was the Bloomington campus specific email and that it would still be usable. I hadn't used the .uits one or whatever it was in years and didn't care about it, but couldn't find any information about .Indiana. I talked to a few UITS employees who also had no idea and no idea how to find out.  On Canvas, it'd be awesome if you could mark announcements as read in a course without having to open each one. Or, at least if you were able to move to the next or previous announcement without having to navigate back to the announcements page in between each one.  IU app is infuriating. I have serious problems accessing my school email from my phone - it won't load in the app and will show the first few with a load circle but will never actually load. Maybe display a certain amount per page so it actually loads? Also, if I login on my phone browser (Safari) it will just show a white screen after login and validation and won't ever load unless I go to a private window.  Changing the Adobe Creative Suite to the IU login made it so much more complicated if you were already doing the yearly license thing and it took me like a week to be able to get into it this year.  You guys don't need to contact people to help them with specific IT support problems, you need to find people willing to help you find the problems in the software they use every day.  UITS has been really helpful with some of the technological problems that I have experienced in the past.  One thing is it's not really clear to me where the \"central\" UITS office is. I'm not positive if Wells is where I should go if I had a problem, or somewhere else.  I think UITS does a great job of making students aware of their services.  I had not realized UITS does so much for the campus. For all of the services that I have used, I have been very pleased with the results.  I have always had good experiences with UITS. I have not needed their help too much, but they have helped me with issues connecting to Canvas as well as helping me various times during the transition with Duo Login. They were also very helpful with helping me print in color a few times before I finally got it down.  I think UITS could advertise and offer 1-2 informational sessions a month to students to help show us some of the technological services and short cuts that are offered at IU, such as educating on the products offered on IU Ware or the mobile.print.iu website (I was logging on to computers and accessing google drive documents to print them for most of my college career when I could have just done it from my own laptop).  Generally speaking, dealing with UITS is far less bureaucratic than most institutions at IU.  I had a negative interaction with UITS where Microsoft office stopped working on my laptop. The representative I was working with seemed extremely disinterested in helping and was focusing on the homework they were working on.  I've had two good experiences with UITS where my computer completely shut down and they were able to redownload Microsoft and all my programs back to my computer.  none  I have only had good experiences with UITS!  I have only had one experience with UITS staff, and it was good.  I don't have any issues.  UITS staff is very helpful! The one.iu.edu page is extremely difficult to use. The student center page is the absolute worst, I remember looking for something, finding it, then forgetting how I got there and having to spend 30 minutes doing it again. The one.iu.edu page is extremely frustrating and hard to use.  UITS has helped me install Adobe software and Box Sync in the library help center.  UITS has been mostly helpful during my time at I. I appreciate how they improved the duo login this year so we have an option to remember for 7 days.  I have had a positive experience with UITS. I feel that sometimes they can be condescending when helping with computer issues that I am struggling with, however, they do get the job done.  They do their job in the best of their ability.  I have always received the services I need from UITS staff with positive outcomes.  All of my past experiences with UITS have been good. I was able to solve a technology issue through contacting the support center and messaging an employee online through chat support.  I have never interacted with staff but I think everything runs smoothly.  All good.  Overall, pretty impressed!  Network quality on campus is superb, and I love using Mercury for projects.  Front end is pretty great, though there are some apps and course-management things that could be consolidated. Ie, We have like, two or three totally different portals for browsing the course catalog. I'm also not a huge fan of the \"App\" analogy that is used on the interface design for one.iu, BUT that's me, I can understand how normal users likely find that more comfortable for them.  I approve of, and a appreciate the move to canvas, even if it's a nightmare to administrate (which I hear it is, my girlfriend manages a canvas instance for a makerspace) Canvas will be much more secure than Oncourse was. Duo is good, even if people complain about it constantly, it is needed.  It could be improved, by selling more hardware tokens/ raising awareness of them. Tokens are more convenient, and never lose signal. Also, someone's personal device is a much higher priority for being stolen than something like a hardware token. So tokens are, in my mind, much more secure.  For learning spaces, I think it would be nice to have more staff tending to things like projectors and sound systems. Every class I'm in uses them, and there's frequently something wrong. At the very least, in the fine arts building.  I would really like to see a bigger push to virtualize the rest of campus. There are a few labs on campus that use thin-clients (I think the Smith computer lab in Collins LLC is one) and they're significantly faster, CHEAPER, and have advantages for accessing odd editing programs over the network when I need them. In my mind this might be cheaper than continually buying full fledged desktops that inevitably get thrown into IU surplus. More VMs, thin-clients, fewer mac labs!!  This next part is a bit of a tangent.  If anyone reading this has the power, Please, tell the Fine Arts building to stop pushing for mac labs!! no one wants them! They're significantly worse at everything. You can't manage them with hyper- visors, they have terrible hardware specs, they frequently lose connection to the schools network on startup, and have no support for virtual reality that I know of. Which is what the fine arts computer lab is intended for! No idea who petitioned for that, but a mac lab will be harder for everyone.  tldr; I don't want use them, and no sys admin in their right mind (that I know of) wants to manage a mac lab on a giant network like iu, they are not enterprise tools.  Anytime I have interacted with UITS, the staff has been extremely helpful in assisting me in my technological needs while at IU. I have used the online chat multiple times, which is very useful, since you don't have to go anywhere to get tech help on campus.  I think that the use of TopHat in classes is not necessary and is a bit distracting. For one of my classes, we use TopHat to answer questions throughout the class, which ends up in most people playing on their phones.  I have had good experiences with UITS at the library when I have had issues with my laptop. I should like the Wi-Fi to be better at IU owned apartments.  I really enjoy using box for my projects as that allows me to access it anywhere without any trouble. It is also great for team projects as many people can use it together.  The only concern I have is that the One.iu app does not work properly in places where internet speed isn't that great.   ### Graduate responses:  Fewer emails from UITS!  I really like all of the different technology available to students, especially on IUWare/IUAnyWare. Also, the library catalog space is amazing!  I would like to see tutorials on how to use different technologies that are not an entire course. The Student Central page is for dinosaurs and super difficult to navigate. The printers in SPEA hardly ever work and the graduate lounge computers take forever to boot up.  I have no thoughts for new services; perhaps, streaming platforms. Probably out of the purview of IT, but could we get a subscription to APA.  There should be a easy online/auto mechanism for students to apply \"ADMINISTRATOR\" privilege on public/specific desktops, especially those specific computer in some labs that some graduate student will touch every day in daily research.  No complaints other than the internet connection in the around the music buildings is not great.  Staff at Wells Library is very helpful and knowledgeable. Over the phone one staffer was a bit \"technical\", and went on and on about details that I did not understand, but in the end I got the answer I was looking for. Please bring back Stata to lab computers (as opposed to IU Anyware). Also, please make the user interface of IU lab computers uniform across buildings; SGIS seems to have a different user interface (at least for the computers at the front for instructors).  The cloud services are indispensable for my work (both research and teaching), so I hope you can improve them by addressing some of the bugs in IU Dropbox (to be clear: I am not referring to IU Box, but IU Dropbox) that is linked to my laptop account. I am unable to delete a folder on IU Dropbox on lab computers. Also, when using software from IU Anyware (such as Latex or Stata) on lab computers, I am unable to access my files via that software that are stored in the IU Drobbox cloud.  I am in a 100% online Masters degree program and live in Paris, France, so most of these services are nonexistent for me.  I do greatly appreciate being able to finding resources in the libraries.  As a new student I found the IT staff to provide a great service and be very skilled!  It would be nice if Wi-Fi was available outside the buildings on campus however.  Anytime I've dealt with UITS the response has been quick and effective.  Prompt replies and resolutions.  One.IU and Student Central are not very user-friendly or navigable. I was very confused and surprised, as a first year graduate student trying to prepare to move to IU back in the Spring when I was trying to navigate these venues.  Mostly OK experience.  UITS has always been very helpful for me - efficient, thorough, and friendly. No concerns!  The email blasts are hard to understand what's relevant to me. Lots of technical jargon and I end up just deleting them.  eTexts are ok but the note feature is pretty clunky. The search feature and TOC is nice but, I don't like being forced to use eTexts for class. I would rather choose.  Had a good experience with kisbit.  I love the UITS chat help!  Everything seems reliable. Things are fixed when there are problems. The systems seem secure. You are doing a great job!  There is definitely a learning curve to using one.iu.edu because of the sheer number of applications seemingly scattered around. Using the favorites list is a must for quick and easy access.  I don't know if you are the department over this, but I'm dissatisfied with the fee paying for so many paper copies each semester that I know I will not use.  All of the UITS staff have been helpful each time I have needed assistance. I greatly appreciate their help and patience when I struggle with technology.  I have had some positive experiences working with UITS staff at IUSB when I first got to campus and needed help setting up my accounts. I have been happy to have IUware access and to share these resources with students. I have had some frustrating moments when UITS has not been as helpful as I would have hoped and some staff were rude, while others were not listening to my issue.  Group email accounts keep making you sign in on outlook and it's frustrating.  I think the service is really good!  It will be better if student center is more flexible to use.  Maybe a time estimation of how long we should wait for the bus when we entering which stop we want to get on the bus?  Maybe staplers and hole punchers around each printer?  Great help with video conferencing trouble shooting and email issues.  Can we please add a service that allows the use of Alexa/Google home devices in the residence halls?  The folks answering phones are usually very helpful, but when they deploy someone to a classroom, it takes forever for them to arrive.  When I could not access some of IUIT services off campus, I went to Wells library and without much delay I was attended to in a very polite, efficient manner.  Kevin and the other guy in the back of the office at SPEABits are incredibly kind and helpful with SPEA related issues, and have even tried to help me troubleshoot problems I've had with my personal computer. The other fellas don't seem too eager to help me.  The instructions for some of the software downloads could use some help - simple things like screenshots with the instructions with boxes indicating the area of focus and error pages when things go wrong.  I also have no idea where to send constructive comments like these on a regular basis.  The overall service by UITS is excellent. I have received help whenever I needed it.  I'm in Kelley, so most of my support comes from KSBIT. But in terms of the network infrastructure and system, I'm not sure if anyone in a position of authority is aware, but Box is basically a running joke on campus and tends to not work when it's needed. We nearly lost a significant portion of our data for a research project. I can't be taking chances with hit-or-miss university resources when I'm working on my career as a researcher.  UITS has been great. I really enjoy the live chat (text message) feature. I've used it both on campus and off campus via my home computer and the staff have always been very helpful and nice. I've used some of their software training materials and attended some of their free training. Wish they had classes for more advanced users of Adobe Suite or had something on video editing.  Too many web pages with semi-related information!  At the beginning of my first semester, I had problem with DUO logging and couldn't get into my IU account. It was the IT desk service in the B Wells library that helped me to solve the problem. After that, I went there to look for help several times, on the issues of printing, email, software, etc. The IT staff are awesome and helpful. For now, my only complaint is that the DUO system is very annoying. Especially, when I left my mobile at home or somewhere else, the simple email checking will become impossible. I strongly suggest that IT service allow people to customize their own choice whether or not to turn on DUO.  Some buildings do not have even one printer (Sicamore). I wish there was at least one there.  The internet service in Ballantine Hall during the renovation process has at times been either off or slow/spotty. Many of the office computers also need to be upgraded/replaced.  All of the times I have had an immediate concern and have been helped by a UITS staff member, they have been helpful and thorough.  No concerns.  I have not had much interactions with UITS staff or services.  The imu computer bay downstairs by the printers is consistently terrible.  When I upload my documents to be printed through the mobile print site, they expire the next morning. This is inconvenient when I send something to be printed the night before. It would be nice if my documents could remain uploaded for at least 24 hours.  I participated in INTRO TO R FOR BIOLOGISTS and would like to tell you that it was the best workshop to introduce R at IU. The teachers were not only knowledgeable but also created an atmosphere of ease and fun to learn.  No  I always had positive experiences with UTIS  Wi-Fi on my smartphone often times goes off.  I often times cannot access Microsoft Outlook from my smartphone. IU Mobile crashes quite often.  Need to know more about research analytics and the use there of.  I had a good experience with UITS staff at Wells library helping me with an Outlook Exchange sync issue.  I saw the nice office room, which is nice!  For all the services you offered, how would you do to make them operate more efficiently? I don't know most of your services, and I assume most students don't either.  Sometimes I had issues with log in canvas.  My concern is that for the course I teach, I don't have a Mac and most students do. Therefore, some of the intricacies and troubleshooting is difficult and I simply don't know. When trying to find a way to book UITS to come to my class for 20-30 minutes, I was told no and to send my students to them.  This is not too conducive to my semester-long project and if I could just have someone come once and video record them with the computer, that would be so beneficial.  UITS is very responsive and I have noticed them following through with help tickets.  One.iu.edu is difficult to use. It seems as if every time I try to search for an application I come up with nothing.  Kaltura capture works fairly well as long as I am on campus. Off campus, I can hardly ever successfully upload lectures making it difficult to continue to hold class even when campus is closed.  The UITS newsletter is great. The IQ wall and VR that is on the IUN campus is complete news to me. I wish there was a better way to communicate with faculty.  When I have questions, UITS has always been helpful. I find the websites a bit cumbersome but full of some helpful information once I find exactly what I need.  I also struggled to figure out the new printing system. But now that I understand it, it is great! I love being able to send documents from my personal computer directly to the printer of my choice.  I have had trouble with SPSS as some computers in the library had it and others did not. The librarians were not able to tell me which computers to go to in order to use this program. Marking the computers somehow with which have certain programs and which do not would be useful. Or maybe having a computer directory at the library that can tell you which computers to use to access certain programs.  I'm a fairly new student, and when I went to get all my stuff/access everyone was very helpful. Since then I've had little to no interaction with any UITS staff. However, I have really enjoyed the UITS newsletter and other info/services.  I especially love all the access to the software for various purposes. I would love to learn more about what's available, but I don't know that I really have time to use for that.  Mobile print software needs to be updated. Have had positive experiences with UITS staff, who helped me install print software on my computer. Half the time I attempt to swipe my card on a printer though, it doesn't recognize anything.  All the experiences I had with UITS were extremely positive.  One.iu is very difficult to navigate. I also find the library difficult to navigate. The only way I could find the textbook for my class was to use the link the professor provided. As an SPEA Connect student this is very important.  The IU Secure Wi-Fi signal is extremely weak in many parts of the Music Annex, which is where I spend most of my time. I also use the printer in Merrill Hall often, but sometimes I am unable to find the correct printer when printing from the computer there--often the default printer is set to a different printer, and searching for the correct printer doesn't yield any results.  People here are extremely helpful. I remember I was new to the office and did not know how to use the coffee machine here. A kind lady happily and voluntarily helped me and explained in detail how the coffee and other machines work here.  Support has been wonderful so far. I reach out to them by phone, do they have an email address too?  Update canvas  The internet connection is really weak in Memorial Union.  UITS has always efficiently provided me with useful information. I have not had any negative experiences with them. I have received help in person and via online chat and both experiences were positive. The knowledge base is also a great resource and is clear and user-friendly. I don't have any recommendations for new services or improvements.  UITS staff are very responsive and helpful in my experience. Great team.  All staff I've interacted with have been quite friendly and helpful, but I have had ongoing issues with Wi- Fi connections in various locations on campus.  1)         Perhaps consider targeting these surveys to your audience; I'm a distance student, so none of the on-campus questions apply, but I can provide insights into some of the features distance students routinely use. (Heh. See below for more on this.)  2)         The Canvas app for mobile devices is a bit hinky. About 70% of the time, I get an error message (\"Whoops!\") when I try to access our course discussion forums.  3)         The entire Student Center has an antiquated appearance, and the Class Search feature uses odd descriptors for the drop-down fields (and even some of the options), making it not particularly intuitive. (The new class search tool, meanwhile, is completely hopeless at finding online classes I can take for my distance degree.)  4)         Unizin Engage etexts are horrible; slow and unresponsive, ill-fitting on the page, and with limited offline access options. I strongly advise instructors NOT to use these etexts; buying the ebook from Amazon is a MUCH better option, especially for offline reading/highlighting/commenting on mobile devices, and is generally worth the additional cost.  I had a good experience with UITS Staff, most especially when I just got to Bloomington from Nigeria and the only means to reach my family back home was via the internet.  I think the UITS is doing a great job. The UITS staff attached to my faculty has been of great help to me especially as a new student and getting me set up. I had a little problem setting up a new device for my DUO app, when I misplaced my former device. I think the Two step login under One.iu.edu specially managing of devices can be more simplified.  I live in on campus housing and the wireless internet is pretty unreliable, especially during high traffic times in the evening. I really like that we now have access to cable through the internet, but I am often unable to watch because there isn't enough bandwidth.  They have always been very helpful whenever I had any concerns in the Wells library.  UITS staff has always been very responsive and helpful.  I feel as though it's hard to get a hold of UITS. Often once they respond, they're fairly dismissive of problems. Especially about Canvas. This is bad enough for me, but then even worse for students because they'll have problems with Canvas and I can't reliably expect that the problems will be solved quickly.  I REALLY wish that instructors did not have to use their exchange emails. It is an utter pain, and it makes no sense given that the school has Google at IU.  Box works fine, but I'd much prefer if we got unlimited access to Dropbox. It's a bit of a pain to coordinate the two storage systems.  IUCAT is marvelous, but I don't understand why parts of it keeping going down. And I don't like how the library website was redone.  I am happy with the level of service I've received from UITS so far, and I don't really have any suggestions for the future.  Polite agents.    I haven't had any interactions with UITS staff or services.  They don't take care of the GIS lab in SPEA very well, printer system is confusing and one.iu isn't useful at all.  Top Hat clicker responses have many glitches. The app does not work for most students and many times, logging into the website doesn't work either. A different clicker/ participation source should be investigated.  Very much appreciate that staff disinfect the computers in the Wells Library. School of Education Library computer stations and printers are much cleaner and work better now that Dr. Frye is taking care of them. How does one access the Wells 24/7 commons to use the computers when the main doors are locked?  There are a lot of great things, but, the following could improve:  The scanning system on the school printers have a memory of about 35 pages; they cannot scan more than 35 pages on a single account.  There should be more options for the two-step login especially when one forgets their phones at home; maybe verification through a non-IU email?  Pulse Secure does not efficiently facilitate off-campus access to library material and links, especially for the school of music.  Some school printers, especially those not in Libraries can stay broken for days before you get to them, which is very inconvenient.  There should be some Wi-Fi access spots on campus that are not inside buildings to encourage people to study in the fresh air outside.  I have only got positive things to say about the staff. Each time I have issues, it gets resolved promptly. There's a need to ensure students are aware of the supercomputers and how they can aid learning  Not particularly- I have not had direct interaction besides receiving emails. Redesign one.iu, the only way to find anything is the search bar.  I have never had a negative experience with any service provided by UITS. All of the individuals are extremely helpful and patient. My only concern is that I am confused about what services UITS does and DOESN'T provide. But they are still pleasant when the issue falls outside of their realm.  I've had good and bad experiences with UITS. The [IRD] UITS unit is not very helpful with troubleshooting issues with software both on IUAnyware and software downloaded from IU systems, like ThinLinc. Also, the [IRD], didn't respond to my email promptly. It's been a week since I sent the email.  The library UITS staff are very helpful and know how to communicate well. [IRD] do not know how to communicate clearly. It would be great if they updated their website. There are lots of links to pages that no longer exist. I had the hardest time figuring out where I could access [IRD].  I don't like IUAnyware because it crashes frequently, but I like that it's a back up.  Microsoft Outlook has weird glitches when you are scrolling through certain parts of your inbox, the page will suddenly jump back about 10 messages and it does this continually at the same point in page every time.  Almost anytime I have to download a program from IUWare I have an issue with the installation.  The UITS webpage is actually difficult to navigate. I have to use google to find things instead of finding things intuitively through a menu on UITS' website.  no complaints so far  UITS staff have been very helpful with my technology questions. Throughout my time at IU, UITS staff have helped me override my laptop's restrictions and access Wi-Fi, access mobile printing, and deal with 2-step login issues. I have not had any negative interactions.  All experiences have been very positive, and I would be lost without UITS in my 6 years of grad school here at IU.  For nearly eight years, I have interacted with UITS on multiple campuses and in multiple roles. Overall, UITS lacks a customer service perspective. Systems and processes are clearly arranged for the convenience and understanding of the technical staff, with seemingly no attention paid to the customer's perspective. As a customer, I have been frustrated on numerous occasions.  Satisfied with all services.  The printing services are a giant, confusing mess. Please find a way to streamline it.  It was frustrating to have to login into One.IU every time I needed to get on to the magnitude of 10 times an hour. I would leave the computer to do something else and have to log back in. I would recommend increasing the length of time until everyone is automatically logged out of IU to an hour or so. I would also increase the length of time that it remembers your passcode to 2 weeks instead of the current 7 days.  I'm not sure if this counts by the IT people in my department have been beyond amazing. They have helped me with numerous issues relating to my computer and printing issues. They were friendly and responded very fast to my emails, a wonderful group of people!  I don't like the self service on the student account when it comes to registration. In order to register for classes, I go to a new fancy course registration website. The problem with the new website is that for some of my graduate courses it automatically selects the incorrect (sometimes) course number. In order to select the correct course, I have to remove the course on the fancy website and go to the old website to add them correctly. Sometimes it won't allow me to personally do it so my advisor (or someone) adds me into the course.  I have serious concerns for the 2 step log in system, because when I travel to a place where there is no power to charge cellphone battery of internet, I can miss critical messages requiring urgent actions. I just dislike this two step log in. it should have been optional not imposed. I know it is for security.  UITS staff has consistently been friendly, non judgmental, and has helped to find a solution. Sometimes this has led to investigating every possible option, even if a fix was found, which takes considerable time - more time than budgeted to spend with help staff.  Online help requests are answered promptly and followed up, which is much appreciated.  No comment.  Hope there are more classrooms with hearing aids coupling equipment.  UITS staff have always been so patient and helpful when I come to them with a problem! They're never condescending and have been so friendly and kind when I've emailed, called, or stopped by the help desk.  eTexts aren't very useful for students overseas because of the need for a constant internet connection to highlight, make notes, and review previous notes. In addition, highlights aren't transferred to the copy created by printing to pdf, so there's no way to preserve my notes.  Because of the internet issues, I've had to print the book to pdf 50 pages at a time and highlight in Acrobat by line (the text doesn't print as recognizable text). Something to keep in mind for online students please!  So far I have had very good experiences with UITS.  They have been very quick to respond to any queries I have had so far.  Help staff at the union seem knowledgeable when assistance is needed with things (i.e. duo login).  I have only had a few interactions with its services but they have all been pleasant.  As an instructor, UITS staff were always very prompt in responding to issues with technology in my classroom. However, the fact that I needed to call because computers would not properly display material for my courses in several classrooms on campus, showed that the technology here needs to be better evaluated, selected, and installed. As another example, when I was serving as technical support for an international conference here at the university, I called UITS to ask whether there was a camera and software installed in a large room in Jordan hall for us to use for recording a talk. UITS informed me that the room was ready to go; however, when I needed the camera that evening, I learned that the camera drivers had never been installed and the camera was merely sitting there on the computer while the software for streaming was properly installed. There should be checks to prevent these types of issues.  I have not had any bad experiences with UITS.  Canvas often has issues that IT consultants try to blame on users. Every time I've asked and insisted it isn't my computer, it actually turns out to be a legitimate issue with Canvas that takes a while to resolve. This is a great site when it works, but I wouldn't recommend online classes to anyone because it has a lot of glitches that seem to confuse people at the university.  Last year, I could not establish an internet connection in my apartment (on-campus housing). I appreciated the quick response from UITS. Unfortunately, the troubleshooter sent to our apartment could not identify the problem. It took more than two days for us to know that the issue occurred because our router was broken, and we found it ourselves. If they came equipped with the router to check, I believe that they would have revealed the problem quickly. So, please support your staff with an appropriate diagnostic tool.  No experience  No negative experiences yet.  My experience has been pretty positive. The only unsolved issue I've had is that I can't seem to figure out how to remote access the computer in my office from my laptop when I'm on campus. It is really important when I need to use Matlab in class on my laptop (because my laptop refuses to run Matlab).  Overall, I think UITS is doing a good job. I had a great experience at the start of the year when a member of UITS trained my team on a whole bunch of applications. A couple things I think could improve is the laundry monitoring system. It seems to not be functioning correctly every once in a while when I need it. Also, an update to the Wi-Fi system so that google homes, amazon echos, alexas, etc. could work would be awesome. Lastly, I wish graduate students and staff could pick whether they want to use gmail or Microsoft outlook. It is hard being a graduate student supervising undergrads and communicating events and other info across platforms. I also think Gmail is a much friendlier platform but I understand outlook is easier to secure.  I have had only positive interactions with UITS staff.  I think that the UITS staff are friendly and helpful whenever I need them.  Printer service in the JH atrium has been spotty.  I oftentimes use the online chat with UITS, and have found it to be convenient when I run into a problem.  The IU Mobile app feels awkward to use. Is it not just a trimmed-down web browser that always loads One? I'm not sure what other form it could take - maybe just some QoL changes?  I've received responses in a timely manner, which is very helpful to the process. I also like that my file can be opened whenever I have a question on the same topic again in the future.  Be sure not to send emails to distance ed students that are only specific to on-campus students.  My biggest problems are the printers and trying to upload documents through print.iu.edu. It barely ever recognizes my documents on the first attempt, or when I scan my ID card, my documents don't show up. Forwarding emails never ever works for me. When I have something to print, I'm always more than let down and know a hassle is coming. They are a drag unless you print directly from a university computer.  I am an online student, so no issues!  I work at the library, and when I have to refer patrons, UITS is usually pretty responsive and helpful. I also had a computer question and issue, and went to UITS for assistance and although I ended up figuring it out on my own, the UITS personnel were attentive to my issue.  Largely the problems I have are navigability of sites/services, and consistency in accessing information.  The few issues I've had have been resolved very fast.  UITS does not support people who do not own Mac computers or iPhone. I do not own either of those two and every time I have had a tech issue I have never been able to receive any help to resolve the issue. "

    "body": "  ## Jody Whiteside  Residence manager, Residential Programs and Services, IU Bloomington  It took her a while to come around, but now that Jody Whiteside has learned the benefits of Teams, there’s no going back.  “Microsoft Teams was a little scary at first, but I have to admit, this is one of the best programs I've had to deal with and work with professionally,” she said. “It has made my life so much easier.”  As a residence manager for two of IU Bloomington’s largest residence halls, Briscoe Quadrangle and Foster Quadrangle, Jody handles the living quarters of nearly 2,000 students and staff living and working in the buildings. She also manages a staff of around 80 part-time student workers, their work schedules, their training, and their eventual departures from IU.  “Teams has really helped me keep on top of the sheer amount of work day-to-day, all the little things,” Jody says. “We also have a very transient group of employees at multiple levels, so I’ve told my staff no work should be on your personal device. It needs to be done in Teams. That way, when you leave there's an archive and history, so the next person coming in isn't starting and reinventing the wheel.”  The Teams tool she uses most often is Shifts. She's even developed her own RPS-specific Microsoft training: Welcome to Teams 101 and Welcome to Shifts 101. “I really like Shifts. It took me a while to figure it out but it’s so incredibly versatile and ties in with the Task system.”  Build skills in Shifts and check out UITS IT Training’s Teams offerings.

    "body": "  ## 2019 UITS User Survey Summary IUPUI   ### Brief guide to understanding the data  The UITS User Survey is administered by the Center for Survey Research. Surveys were sent to 8,286 randomly selected people at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (835 Faculty, 1,108 Staff, 4,405 Undergraduate students, 1,938 Graduate students). Please note that respondents who reported in the first question of the survey that they did not use UITS systems or services were not asked any additional questions and were removed from the results presented here.  The questions on the survey are primarily Likert opinion scales (1-5 rating scales with 5 being the most favorable rating). Responses to open-ended questions (for example, Question 9, see the survey questionnaire [INSERT LINK]) are not presented here. The results include:  For the average opinion and the satisfaction (helpfulness, importance, awareness, and agreement) scores , confidence intervals are provided. The confidence intervals indicate the sampling error for each estimate at the 95% confidence level. Average opinion and satisfaction (helpfulness, importance, awareness, and agreement) scores and their associated confidence intervals are not reported if they are based on fewer than 25 respondents. For categorical response questions that do not involve ratings such as whether the student lives in University housing or how often computing problems prevent accomplishing daily work, data are not reported for the full question if they are based on fewer than 25 respondents and data are not reported for a particular category if at least one (1) but fewer than five (5) respondents selected the category. Data that are not reported are indicated by “N/A”. “Not Applicable/Do Not Use” responses were removed prior to the calculation of estimates, except for usage rates. Missing data and “Unsure” responses were excluded from estimates as well.  This summary includes data from 1,022 people who participated in the survey (131 Faculty, 355 Staff, 308 Undergraduate students, 228 Graduate students). Results were weighted to reflect the total counts of faculty, staff, undergraduate students, and graduate students at IUPUI in the fall of 2018. This helps to correct for overrepresentation of some subpopulations (for example, staff) and underrepresentation of others (for example, students) among those who chose to respond to the survey by bringing their representation in line with the total counts in the overall IUPUI population. Sampling error estimates account for weighting of the data.  It is important to note that some services are used only by certain subpopulations, so results are shown for the appropriate subpopulations. Subpopulations are indicated by FAC for faculty, STF for staff, GRD for graduate students, and UND for undergraduate students. In some cases, the scores are for groups of subpopulations, indicated for example by [GRD, UND] for services used by graduate and undergraduate students. Results are shown separately for multiple subpopulations where appropriate.  For detail on the study methodology, please see [INSERT LINK].   ### General Services  1.

    "body": "  ## 2021 IUPUC User Survey – Methods Summary  UITS at Indiana University contracts with the IU Center for Survey Research (CSR) to conduct a biennial survey aimed at assessing current usage, awareness, and levels of satisfaction with UITS services.   ### Population and Sample:  The target population for the 2021 UITS User Survey is all current IUPUC faculty, staff, undergraduate, and graduate students. A random sample of 25% of each subpopulation was drawn from IU administrative databases. The university databases should be highly accurate and complete in providing coverage of the target population. The 2021 UITS User Survey was administered as a web survey and distributed via email invitation on January 27, 2021 to 370 randomly selected people at IUPUC (47 Faculty, 23 Staff, 275 Undergraduate students, 25 Graduate students).   ### Questionnaire and Data Collection:  The survey questions were developed by UITS. They ask about usage of email, devices, and services, as well as satisfaction with various tools and services available to the campus. The questions on the survey are primarily Likert opinion scales (1-5 rating scales with 5 always being the most favorable rating). Most questions include an “N/A” or “Do not use” response option. The survey was programmed in Qualtrics and thoroughly tested by CSR and UITS staff. The survey was administered in English only.  The field period for the 2021 UITS User Survey was January 27, 2021 through March 1, 2021. An invitation and five reminders were sent by email to maximize participation. As an incentive for participation, survey participants were entered into a drawing for one of fifteen $100 cash prizes (drawn from participants at all IU campuses).   ### Final Dispositions and Response Rates:  Table 1 below indicates the population and sample size (the number of surveys originally sent out to the randomly selected individuals), the number of actual responses, and the percentage of responses received by subpopulation. Population sizes were obtained from University Institutional Research and Reporting. A questionnaire was categorized as a respondent if at least three questions were answered.  Final dispositions for all cases were classified according to The American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR). 2016. Standard Definitions: Final Dispositions of Case Codes and Outcome Rates for Surveys. 9th edition. Table 2 itemizes final dispositions and the AAPOR Response Rate, RR2.  AAPOR Response Rate 2 is calculated using the following formula:  \\(RR2 = {(I+P) \\over (I+P) + (R+NC+O) + (UH+UO)}\\)  AAPOR Response Rate 2  12.2%   ## Weights:  Results were weighted to reflect the total counts of those employed by the university (Faculty and Staff, combined) and students (Undergraduate and Graduate students, combined) at IUPUC in the fall of 2020 (shown in Table 1). Since there were fewer than 20 respondents in the faculty and staff subpopulations, faculty and staff were combined for weighting purposes. Similarly, since there were fewer than 20 respondents in the graduate student subpopulation, graduate and undergraduate students were combined for weighting purposes. Weighting helps to correct for overrepresentation of some subpopulations (for example, staff) and underrepresentation of others (for example, students) among those who chose to respond to the survey by bringing their representation in line with the total counts in the overall IUPUC population. More specifically, the weights were defined as the number in the population divided by the number of respondents for each combined subpopulation (employees, students). For example, for employee respondents (included faculty and staff), their weight was (144+73)/(14+10)=9.0.  All estimates were weighted. Sampling error estimates account for weighting of the data.

CRM executive leadership will review, approve, and prioritize the project charter for incorporation into the enterprise-wide IU CRM Initiative’s strategic roadmap.  Because the project scope will focus on technical solution design and implementation, your stakeholders and the adopting units will own and manage adoption, business process redesign, and all other functional-related tasks.  If you have an existing CRM pillar that has an established stakeholder steering committee, the CRM team will manage your users’ submitted change requests in an established backlog and the appropriate steering committee will approve and prioritize the requests. The project executive sponsor will designate a stakeholder group to review requests to establish new pillars.   ## Roles and responsibilities   ### Project stakeholders   ### Project change control  Any change or addition to identified objectives that will impact timeline, budget, or scope must be approved by the designated change control team. They will also provide approval to all changes or additional requirements that impact project scope (deliverables/timeline/budget).   ### Project functional partners   ### Designated approvers  Designated approvers will be one to two stakeholders and one to two functional partners that will have the authority to provide all approvals on behalf of each group where they are needed in the project.   ### CRM project lead   ### CRM analyst team   ### CRM technical team   ### Implementation partner consultants  Projects may require third-party consultants who will be contracted to work as implementation partners. The CRM project lead will manage and leverage consultant resources as needed.   ## Incremental releases  Project objectives will be developed and delivered in increments. Each increment will represent a complete subset of functionality, and the increment may be either small or large. Once an increment is complete, the next increment will start and repeat all increment stages.   ## Stages of development   ### Stage 1—Analysis  CRM business analysts will schedule and conduct meetings with functional partners to define, refine, and document detailed requirements of each scoped objective along with user acceptance criteria. The purpose of the analysis process is to define requirements of business objectives, but not to prescribe technical solutions. Technical solutions will be designed in the development stage by the CRM technical team to ensure extensibility and alignment with the IU CRM platform. Each requirement will be documented in a project space in Confluence. Functional partners must approve requirements and acceptance criteria before development begins.   ### Stage 2—Development  Requirements will be transitioned to the CRM technical resources unit for development.   ### Stage 3—Design approval  CRM analysts will provide solution demo in the CRM stage instance to project function partners.   ### Stage 4—User acceptance testing  After the design is approved, the CRM technical team will move the solution from CRM stage to the CRM sandbox instance.   ### Stage 5—Deployment  After user acceptance testing and signoff is complete, the CRM technical team will package the completed solutions and push them to the CRM production environment as part of a standard monthly release cycle. Once in production, any issues identified will be considered production support. Any revisions or updates after solutions have been moved to production are considered change requests and will be incorporated into future project phases.   ## Find the help you need  Want to learn more about IU CRM or have other technology questions?

    "body": "  ## The CIB is for IU and for you  The CIB serves education, business, and the community. The interactive work environment brings together more than 600 IU staff, previously dispersed in offices across campus. Bringing offices together under one roof means better focus on issues where IT@IU can make a significant difference.  [Find directions, contact details, and more for the CIB](https://kb.iu.edu/d/anpr)   ## It’s easy bein’ green  In 2013, the CIB received Gold LEED (Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design) certification, an internationally recognized process for green building developed by the U.S. Green Building Council. It remains an energy-efficient, sustainable building model for the university.   ## A sustainable model for IU  The CIB set a new standard for university carbon footprints. The construction and design maximize sunlight and solar power, staff workspaces are designed for energy efficiency, and paperless document management is the norm.   ### Commuting  Fuel efficient and carpool vehicles. To contribute to lowering carbon emissions, the CIB offers preferred parking for carpooling and fuel-efficient vehicles. Bike room. To encourage biking to work—good exercise and a means of reducing carbon emissions—the CIB has a secure, indoor bike storage area with room for 35 bikes.   ### Water management  Landscaping. Many of the plants outside the CIB are native to our region and were chosen for their hardiness. The CIB has no permanent irrigation systems.  Rooftop water drains. Rooftop water drains on the flat CIB roof transport rainwater through drains embedded in the building wall, to the rain gardens below.  Storm water. The rain gardens absorb much of the water from the roof. The tiers of soil and vegetation filter this runoff, reducing the amount of water flowing into storm drains.  Pint urinals. It takes only one pint of water to flush. Along with low-flush toilets, these help reduce water use.  Automatic faucets. Automatic faucets contribute to our goal of reducing water use by 40%.   ### Energy and atmosphere  Chillers. The “chiller unit” is made up of two, 200-ton, liquid-cooled chillers that maintain cooling and heating. This chiller was salvaged from the Wrubel Computing Center, saving the university the cost of buying a new one.  Louvers. Exterior louvers and interior sunshades work together to block or capture light as needed, according to the season. The louvers are in fixed positions to block summer sun coming in from a higher angle, and admitting winter light that enters from a lower angle.  Shades. The sunshades are programmed to adjust over the course of the day and year. They can be open all the way, half way, or at 25% intervals, according to the need for sunlight.  Reflective white roof. The roof is covered in a white rubber membrane that reflects the sun’s radiation, lowering the amount of heat absorbed by the building and contributing to the building’s overall energy efficiency.  Solar water panels. Rooftop solar water panels use the sun’s energy to heat a portion of the hot water needed in the building for the locker rooms, kitchens, bathrooms, and dining facilities.   ### Material Use  Recycling. The CIB Green Team encourages recycling. Staff recycle plastics (1–7), aluminum cans, batteries, paper, cardboard, and glass bottles. Trashcans are labeled “Landfill” as a reminder of the impact of landfill on the planet.  Water bottle filling station. Bottle filling stations set into the wall provide filtered drinking water throughout the building, eliminating the need for plastic. The digital readout logs the number of plastic bottles kept from the waste stream.  Print release stations. With very few exceptions, printing at the CIB is conducted through Print Release Stations located in the copy/scan rooms at the end of each wing. Staff pick up printouts at any printer by signing into a password-protected computer. Encouraging staff to “Print Less, Go Green” is an important part of lowering the environmental impact of our work.   ### Indoor environmental quality  Views and space. The glass-walled, light-filled CIB provides most staff a view to the outdoors. The open floors promote communication, collaboration, and creativity, and generous hallways and stairs encourage getting up and moving around.  Enclosed copy/scan rooms. Copy/scan rooms are enclosed to minimize the amount of paper and toner particles released into work areas.  Flushing the HVAC system. The building's heating and cooling systems were “flushed” before staff moved in to remove gases that can escape from new carpeting and wall paints. Filters placed over the vents capture particulates. This helps maintain cleaner air and comfortable temperatures and humidity. "

    "body": "  ## 2021 UITS User Survey IU Bloomington (IUB) – Open Text Responses (Edited)  This text file includes responses to the following question of the UITS survey:  (At start of the survey): As you get started, please take a moment to share with us any thoughts, concerns, issues, and/or ideas that you may have. What positive experiences with UITS staff or services have you had? Are there concerns or negative interactions that you want us to know about? Do you have recommendations for new services or improvements to existing ones? (You will have a chance to review, amend, or add to your comments before submitting your responses.)  (At end of the survey): If you entered comments at the beginning of the survey, they are displayed below. If you would like to edit your comments, share recommendations for additional services and support resources, or add additional comments or suggestions please enter them below.  The responses are listed by respondent case number. Case numbers, in which the respondent did not leave any text, are not included.  Identifying references have been removed from this document and replaced with “[IRD]”. Responses are grouped by sample: Faculty, Staff, Undergraduate students, and Graduate students.   ### Faculty responses:  I have always had positive experiences with UITS.  I've had a great experience working with the staff at UITS. Some people I want to call out are [IRD], [IRD], and [IRD] But I could go on - everyone's been really nice and helpful.  I wish it was easier to search UITS for help guides on tech issues. I spend too long searching for it.  So far every time I had an issue (big or small) I was able to work with my local department's IT team or broader UITS to get it resolved.  I also am overall impressed with the types of technological solutions that I was given access to through IUware.iu.edu.  Whenever I send a student to you for help, problems always seem to be resolved quickly. I appreciate that deeply.  One.IU is quite nearly useless. There are too many apps, it is not intuitive, and it's not clear what apps are important or not. Apps are not suggested to me based on my role(s) within the university. It's basically a dumpster fire that I'm told to go digging in if I need something without any helpful way to navigate it.  I have had a good experience with the IT staff. They have been helpful during my few visits to the helpdesk chat. The only frustrating thing was the multiple email issues I have had. They could identify the issue, but were not able to resolve it. The email services in general are a bit confusing. It feels like I had to hunt for information on my own when it could be centrally located or linked on the email management page.  The IU anyware is very hard to use with IBM SPSS. I don't know if there is a way to work around this, but it makes it very difficult to work with students. If I have to work with a student in SPSS we typically spend as much time troubleshooting and setting up SPSS as we do actually using the application. It is very laggy and is hard to get set up, especially with accessing files.  I enjoy all of the \"free\" software through UITS, including Office and the Adobe Creative Cloud.  UITS has always been helpful when I've contacted them. The printers scattered throughout campus are SUPER glitchy sometimes. Some of the printers in the residence halls (i.e. Collins, Foster, and Read) aren't connected properly to the network, so you can't print to them, or they don't print at all. They also still charge you for the print job, but then they won't print. Also, just a friendly tip, if you want to increase chances of people participating in your survey, you should consider writing a mail merge that pulls preferred names and not legal names.  The staff at UITS has always been very helpful, professional, and polite.  I work in the Hamilton Lugar School, and it is frustrating for scholars abroad not to be able to fax us documents but to use the \"secure\" email system. It would be much easier for all concerned if the school had a fax number and fax machine.  It would also be helpful for faculty to receive detailed instructions on how to access and use OneDrive!  I have very positive experience with our Departmental IT people. I cannot say the same about the University UITS staff. Their responses are slow and in some cases not very well informed.  The quick service and no-BS way of helping students get their technology problems solved quickly.  Tough to wait for my computer to be updated (native software updates on my Mac) through an administrator's assistance, as it requires their log in and password....  It's very annoying not to have administrator privileges on my own desktop computer. I can't install or update software, unless it's the standard stuff that IU offers.  That, combined with the pandemic restrictions, have made me move most of my work to my home computer.  My office computer is also painfully slow, despite being a new Macintosh. It must come with pretty minimal RAM.  Sometimes there is a lack of clarity on best way to get stared with HPC and what pricing looks like for supported services.  Biggest issue: many of us are Linux users, and it is just about impossible to get any support. This is a significant problem, especially for the scientific / STEM disciplines.  Overall my experience has been good. However when things go wrong or don't work properly, the lag time to get help is very frustrating.  My main negative interaction is the constant shifting of available resources and how to access them. For instance, we now have the move to Exchange online that is inconvenient, happening quickly, and to my mind ill-motivated. Each time you shift how we use information technology, you cost every member of the community some amount of time and energy. This is burdensome and seems to happen on more and more rapid cycles. I understand that someone working in IT might want everything optimized and up to date. But on the user end, having consistent products and systems that don't require changing installations, programs and learning new software is simply better. Learning new IT tricks isn't part of my job description, and it really should not be. Another example is mathematica, where it went from being available offline, to being available IUAnywhere, to no longer being supported. In something like 5 years.  For as long as I can remember, UITS staff and services have been positive. Having said that, it's painful when I have a technical problem on a weekend and call the helpline. The consultants sure try hard, but sometimes what seems to be a simple request can turn into an hour of frustration. The solution, of course, is for me to avoid problems on the weekends.  Good experiences so far.  All of my interactions with UITS staff have been professional and positive.  I have been really satisfied with my experience. Out of the dozens of times that I have called UITS, only once did I feel that the representative wasn't prepared to respond to my questions.  I love UITS and sing its praises in my class. I also use UITS services on a daily basis and am very grateful for UITS.  Only complaint is that I used to be able to talk directly to the people who ordered software for the STCs and now I can't. I don't like just filling out a form. I want to also have an email/phone number for the human touch that leads to more details.  Also. I despise WCMS and think it should be eliminated like the plague.  UITS services generally seem to be deteriorating. Canvas is more or less a disaster. The upcoming e-mail migration, in contrast to the Box migration, is simply unclear--who has to migrate and what do we have to do. The communication is horrible. Whenever a problem is reported to UITS, especially about Canvas, the first response is \"clear your cookies and history\"--the attitude is very much that we must configure our computers to be compatible with whatever piece of software they choose to make us use, and everything else be damned--even other pieces of software that they force us to use that require cookies.  First, I want to thank the UITS staff for all of their (extra) work during the pandemic. My frustrations in terms of UITS have always been with programs or tools and availability, not with the helpfulness of the staff  My basic issue with UITS is that the help-desk services are extremely unreliable. The last three or four times I have called for help, I have been given contradictory answers, and also answers that turned out to be simply wrong. In my calls I have been misdirected to a variety of offices, each of which claims not to be responsible for the technology that I am inquiring about. UITS seems very poorly organized, with no communication among its employees, and with poor access to current information among the front-line help desk staff. And don't even ask me about CITO, which takes an average of THREE WEEKS to respond to help requests, and when they do, the problem is generally not solved, e.g., they have never been able to set up network printing from my office to the department printer down the hall: I have not been able to print a pdf from my university-owned computer to the university-owned printer in the 20 years I have been employed here. Ridiculous.  Platforms and procedures change too frequently. Just when I think I have mastered something, we switch to something new, and I have to start the learning curve all over again.  I was impressed with all that was done to make online teaching work. I had a lot of anxiety about it before fall semester started (I wasn't teaching last spring), but with all of the resources that were available, my transition went pretty smoothly.  n/a  UITS has really gone downhill in the last 6 months - unstable systems, poor migrations.  Mostly positive.  I have interacted with IT a couple of times. Every time the response has been in a timely manner; they have been very helpful and have solved my questions and helped with the equipment of my office station.  All positive, as I frequently require assistance in unlocking my account.  I understand this occurs (my record is 11 times in one day & over 30 times in a week) because I have a simple user name that is compromised when individuals with that same user name + digits fall to notice that the spell check on their device has removed the digits when they attempt to log in.  I ask that the practice of assignment to new users with my 5-letter user name + digits be discontinued. It is wholly impractical for me to change the username I have had for over 30 years.  Biennial renewals for affiliate accounts – as in the past – are far preferable to the annual process now in place.  It is frustrating that there are functionalities of Canvas that have been requested & received substantive support that have not been implemented (e.g., the ability to have all content copied from another course UNPUBLISHED when transferred, flexibility in configuring extra credit points, grading based on choice of question …)  UITS has always been helpful by phone, with staff available to address rather complex issues. Moreover when I taught online for the first time during the pandemic I received excellent support whenever needed. I have a high opinion about the knowledge and skill of the staff and their ability to communicate to a layperson.  I'm an Adjunct Instructor in the School of [IRD]. I've always been \"technologically challenged\", and the impacts of Covid, virtual learning, and conducting communications with my students via Zoom made the Fall 2020 semester even more challenging. Without exception the capable staff at UITS were there to help me, provide useful tips and instruction, and well, kept me from going crazy. I especially appreciated, and by the middle of the semester relied heavily upon, their exemplary accountability and rapid response to my questions and needs and problems.  Yes, I have called 812-855-6789 dozens of times the last year and continue to be very very satisfied with my service there. My hats off to you in this regard. I have worked at three other universities and none come close.  However, I have spent about four hours trying to install Creative Cloud on my secondary laptop and it just won't work. Two calls to help support, and it just hangs. I gave up, but I really miss adobe acrobat on that machine.  I hardly ever called UITS before the pandemic. With the move to online teaching, I called them A LOT. 9 out of 10 times I got help right away. A couple of times I had to wait to be contacted by a \"special team\", but I always got help eventually.  The few interactions I have had with UITS staff have been very positive. Friendly, helpful, patient people.  When I have contacted UITS for live support, they have always been very timely and helpful. They have been great in this time of pandemic.  I have had good luck calling and chatting at odd hours (weekends and nights). I appreciate the 24 hour support.  The UITS Support Center staff have been very helpful this past year through many challenges technology-related issues. Most recently, a staff member helped me troubleshoot an issue where Canvas was not allowing me to embed videos from Kaltura (it turned out that one of my browser extensions was causing issues in Chrome).  I understand that UITS is under pressure to cut costs. Please, please do not sacrifice the programs utilized by social scientists and humanities scholars (e.g., Qualtrics, Stata, SPSS, SAS, ArcGIS, Adobe). These programs might seem like low-hanging fruit, especially compared to big-budget research infrastructure like Big Red 2, but they are *essential* to the work of many scholars (including graduate students and undergraduate students) on campus. Social sciences and humanities scholars cannot compete with the physical sciences and health sciences for government and private funding. Thus, it is very difficult for us to get the grants necessary to pay for our own technology licenses. Losing access to these technologies would absolutely cripple social science and humanities scholarship at IU.  More generally, I hate that the RCM (Responsibility Centered Management) model forces units like UITS to cut their own costs by passing work or costs onto other units (e.g., with the Box migration, and with threats to other essential programs and software). I hope that the leaders within UITS will lobby university administrators (and particularly the new President, whoever that will be) to abandon this broken funding model in favor of one that ensures that all units have the technology resources and support they need.  I have had one encounter with UITS, and they were very helpful and professional.  For my IU mail, I receive my emails on two different portals, mail.iu.edu (Microsoft app) and gmail.iu.edu (Google app). I have not been able to fix this issue and keep checking both of my email accounts as I never know whose email will go where.  It will be an extremely useful tool if you can add ocular to supercomputing accounts. I have never understood why is it so difficult or a big problem to do so.  I have also faced a problem with my slate-project account that my access to the file in my slate- project directories is much slower and lags a lot.  Overall, my experience with UITS is very good. I think the departmental support I receive is exceptional. However, I don't like using IUAnyWare because I think it's challenging to figure out and slow to use. I also would like more access to more qualitative and quantitative software-- especially if the expectation in courses is that we use it.  I arrived in August so have had very little interaction with UITS. The only major issue I had was that for whatever reason my Canvas sites could not be merged. I could not do it, and the tech team could not do it. In the grand scheme of things, not horrible, but required having to post 3 versions of everything, which wasted time.  Unilaterally deciding to close off IMAP email access and forcing exchange/Outlook is very bad, and y'all should feel bad. Many faculty rely on IMAP and have built tooling and processes around it.  Using a proprietary email protocol that forces the use of certain email clients is an academically criminal act by UITS. Shame.  Once in a while, a course in Canvas has some type of \"clinch\" such as missing assignments I created. Lucky I am able to access a previous course and import again. This is similar to other things; one example, I created Zoom links with schedule from the beginning to end of the semester. Next thing, 3 courses were missing with Zoom links. Again lucky me had to click on the previous meeting and edit from there. Weird stuff's been happening lately.  None that I can think of.  The knowledge base only offers the option to do full-text searches. This makes it difficult to find relevant information for specific problems. It would be helpful to have an advanced search feature that would make the knowledge base searchable by keywords only in titles, e.g., or to have subject tags that would allow for both more precise advanced searches and browsing.  I've called UITS several times this term and they have always been prompt and helpful. Sometimes the audio quality of the phone call has been poor, but it hasn't been a major issue. I use the Knowledge Base quite often and am grateful for it. Thank you!  I have always only had positive interactions and experiences with UITS staff. I have always felt really supported in regards to anything that I might need that involves technology devices or classroom technology. The only concern I have moving forward is if we are going to move to a more Microsoft-based organization or not. I would not mind if we do; I think there are a lot of untapped resources in the Microsoft suite that we probably pay for and don't use, and I think we should use what we pay for instead of paying for another tool that does the same thing, but I would like there to be a lot of training offered if we are going to move that way. Even if we aren't, I would be interested in learning more about all the Microsoft tools we have and how they can all be integrated.  Overall experience is satisfactory/good.  I have had good experiences with UITS. The response time is really good.  As a new faculty, I have had only positive experiences: help setting up my IU computers and getting the classroom tech I need for teaching hybrid.  I've been fortunate to interact with UITS staff/services for years now through faculty initiatives that I was involved in (such as piloting Next technologies, Communities of Practice, etc.). My experience and interactions have always been great, and when I've reached out to individuals with questions, they have always pointed me in the right direction!  Easy to request for help, many options to get help, and there's follow up to my inquiries if the problem is not resolved  I was given a deadline to renew my SMIME certficate but was having difficulty retrieving the original passphrase that was stored in my work computer. I could not have access to my work computer remotely due to various complications - I moved my office location and my work desktop had to be set up, I filled out the exemption from mitigation testing which means I could not show up on campus etc. All of that made it stressful, and there was no way to extend the deadline. I was given the choice of retrieving the passphrase somehow to renew my SMIME or letting it lapse and apply for a new one again. None of these two was a good option!  The chat helpline is great, but I was promised a follow-up on something over the break regarding an office computer and never heard back. Our office Mac was wiped and given a software update. It no longer has the windows suite and we can't download any other software without an admin PW.  Additionally, the wifi in our office does not work. We cannot use personal devices in the room. We have to use the only wired computer.  NO  Chatting online has always been really easy and quick. I haven't had a bad experience yet in dealing with staff. I have run into issues using printers on campus where paper is out or print options won't be followed through on. I've also found creating supercomputer accounts quick and easy with the documentation online easy to follow.  I often have trouble scheduling COVID mitigation test through iOS.  Data classification matrix is helpful, but there are others that are not included in the matrix that I am unsure of.  All in all, I appreciate all the various resources available through UITS. They are not perfect and have some kinks, and you might need time getting used to all the functionality, but once you know how to use them, they are very convenient.  For the most part, my interactions with UITS staff have been helpful in guiding me to solutions of access issues and concerns about personal and classroom technology.  The one exception was this Fall of 2020. A Canvas course I was teaching as part of a team somehow got unpublished. When the course coordinator contacted UITS, he reported that their initial response was \"we've been experiencing a number of unusual issues this week.\" Rather than approaching the problem as \"unusual,\" I searched Canvas help forums and found the answer almost immediately. While I don't blame the UITS employee for being puzzled, it was an exception to the more methodical troubleshooting that I expect and have experienced from other personnel.  I'm generally quite happy with the technology services provided by the University. But I didn't respond to this survey at first because the email only referred to \"UITS\" and I don't know what that is. Acronyms surround us, and many of them are meaningless to many of us. Please consider sending out correspondence to the University community that refers to \"Information Technology Services\" so that we know who you are and what you do!  In general I have had good experiences with UITS when I needed their help on campus and have used some of their web resources. I wish IU (I realize this is not necessarily a UITS power) had helped us buy or borrow all the technology we have needed this year to do remote learning well.  I receive the UITS newsletter-style email and often do not read it, so I would suggest anything like a security threat should always be sent out in its own email.  I also wanted to take a moment to recognize the great work of the Kaltura team. In the fall I had to use it for the first time and the team was extremely helpful and proactive.  I call UITS fairly often and nearly always have spoken with folks who have helped resolve my issues. I'd suggest all UITS folks be able to access my computer system remotely. I'm fairly low tech, and the time it takes for me to explain the issues I'm having is not a good use of anyone's time. It would expedite service if all UITS staff could simply access my computer to resolve the issues.  It is good so far; when I started my semester it was a little bit slow-responding, but now all good.  Good experience picking up a loaner laptop.  Uploading Zoom recordings often fails. Canvas is often sluggish.  Changes to Zoom settings are communicated well. However, it would be nice to have an option to opt in or out rather than the changes being pushed through to all users. For example, disabling waiting room on Zoom was a nuisance to many users.  I am fairly new to staff. I do wish that I’d received information about the tech steps I needed to take upon hiring (how to set up email, how to find payroll information, how to access IU services, etc...). I was just emailed at my personal account by department management with a contract to sign, and set free from there! Thank goodness for Google.  I have no recommendations because UITS does an excellent job!  I had a very prompt service call with UITS that was very helpful, and the staff were very nice.  Good experience so far  I wish there were an easy, obvious, super-visible, and easy to remember place to go to to contact UITS.  I recognize this is a big institution, but if you intend to make it easy for people to use your services, there needs to be some human - UITS connection, a go-to place, a number, which one can call (or email address to write to) with any tech trouble and that can then direct on forward - the same idea as \"call 311 for city hall\". Unless, of course, the intention is to leave people to figure things out on their own or with their friend network. Which is what I do 80% of the time - and I hate it!  I had to contact our departmental administrator because I did not know where to turn (and obviously one needs help at moments when one is most frazzled).  Once contact was established, the person couldn't have been more helpful and nice, and he has helped me on a couple of occasions now.  I feel like, with the elimination of Box, I don't have a centralized place for accessing all the documents from the Department, University, and other offices. I always feel confused which sources I need to look at to find the necessary information, because every office has its own storage place.  Over the year, I have only had positive experiences with UITS. Prompt and efficient service. The staff are very knowledgeable and cordial.  I have only had positive experiences with UITS, and I want to thank you all from the bottom of my heart for all the hard work, support, and help.  Responses to service requests are prompt, and issues have been solved to my satisfaction, for the most part. Remote service also has been very effective.  the fact that CITO has administrative rights to our computers is really time consuming. Sometimes I need to download something very simple (a very simple program), and I always need them to do it.  I hope the UITS can provide more GPU service for faculty who are engaged in deep learning.  Mostly positive--very helpful overall, quick to reply. There was some confusion about the Box to OneDrive transfer, and there are ongoing issues when multiple users on a project have to manage using both Zoom Health and Zoom at IU accounts.  The assistant from the UITS provides a quick response to my questions or difficulties, which helps me to solve problems much easier.  I have not had any personal encounter with UITS staff yet, but I use my department's desktop for research at times, which is serviced by CITO. At the moment, I am satisfied with the services.  Taking Box down was a bad idea, but maybe necessary. And the new exchange mail setup not being compatible with IMAP is awful, if it is going to happen that way. But the tech capabilities are, generally, pretty amazing.  The UITS staff or services are very efficient; they are quick to respond and solve any issue in a timely manner.  I have only had negative experiences with UITS. The mandatory Windows updates performed by UITS interrupts our running code to process data, and it's very annoying that to install basic software, we always have to go through UITS. This slows down research and is extremely frustrating.  Too often received \"I don't know\" responses, particularly from first-level support, without escalation. Sometimes, KB articles are incomplete or contradictory. I would prefer fewer/longer KB articles than more/shorter ones (the latter seems more likely to lead to conflicting information as things change).  I appreciate the desire to help and solve problems when I contact them.  All positive. Help with setting up my new computer. Help with campus technology.  So far, I have only had positive experiences with UITS! They've always been super helpful and quick in responding to my requests!  Most interactions have been great. Obviously, lately the turn around time has been a little protracted. The SPHBITS team is able to cover most of my needs, and going out beyond to Canvas, Kaltura, or other services, the staff is usually helpful. I seem to be a lightning rod for edge cases, and so I end up having problems that no one can resolve. The Box transfer is a perfect example where my migration is still not complete and had over 300,000 errors. I had to use my own server to make the transfer successful. My officially moved files I believe are still co-owned by the third party assigned to the moving, so that is concerning. Box has not switched ownership either. Just one example of where I have odd issues that seem to have no resolution. Nonetheless, the UITS staff I discuss with are helpful, even if at a loss with what to do. For the other services throughout the survey, I have colleagues that use several of them and are happy with them, even if I do not personally use them. Thus I marked NA because I do not personally use them, but I am sure several of those services are supporting my work through others.  Extremely unhappy with change of e-mail. Very sudden, and we can't meet with our excellent departmental computer person in person so we're on our own. The kb instructions online didn't work. I tried to get chat help for an hour and the UITS person was not able to make it work. He said I should do some things to try afterwards, and they didn't work either.  You did not think the Exchange switch through and you are springing this irresponsibly on us in the middle of a pandemic!!  Also, all you do is to keep pushing all of us more and more into doing everything with Microsoft products.  A much better security approach would be to have a separate password for less-secure activities and a separate password for more-secure activities, rather than to throw us all into some crazy Microsoft business system with features that nobody wants. Or at the very least to wait till the end of the pandemic.  Basically the great majority of people need e-mail, Canvas, Kaltura, and some kind of text- processing. It's nice that you're adding fancy other capabilities for the people who want them, but your main task should be to reliably deliver the basic things that the great majority of people need, and you are not doing that.  THANK you for all that you are doing and have done as faculty and students move to online learning. I have had much help and assistance, and I am most grateful. My complaint is the time I have to wait for answers, usually days and weeks. When in reality I need an answer immediately or sooner than multiple days. As a faculty member, my department and students would find that unacceptable.  Training is great but never heard about the service.  I am not happy about having to pay money to keep using Thunderbird for email.  I am always so impressed when I call in for support. We are truly spoiled to have the resources we do at IU. When my doctoral students move on and start at other universities, one of the first things they comment on is how good they had it here with UITS!  Have been very happy with UITS whenever I've had issues in physical classrooms; haven't dealt with them much during the pandemic.  Last year UITS allowed me to borrow a laptop while mine was broken down, and the staff was very helpful with the process. They even allowed me to borrow a hard-drive transfer doc. Their helpfulness made my transition to a new laptop about as smooth as it could be. I still say hi to the representative who helped me when I see him in the hall (well, before COVID at least).  It takes a long time for the job I submitted to the supercomputer to be executed. Everything else is great!  This past year, several of UITS responses seem like a cut/paste of weblinks that only broadly relate to my initial question. For example, same broad topic, but nothing in the resource/weblink addresses my specific question.  As a faculty member, it is my experience that UITS does an excellent job of resolving technical problems relating to my most common tools, i.e., Canvas and Outlook. The only criticism I have is that certain problems are \"systemwide\", affecting not just me, but whole swaths of University users. In those cases, UITS staff can walk me through a solution, but when I point out that the problem is inconveniencing large numbers of people (i.e., everyone), and that the UITS person should inform somebody at a higher level, the UITS person just shrugs and says, \"There's no way to do that\". An example is a recent change to Outlook. It took me and the UITS person several days to resolve the problem that change created. It made me wonder how frustrated your technical support staff feel to be getting hundreds of calls from frustrated users. It was just rolled out without explanation or documented steps to fix it.  I have always received wonderful help whenever I needed it.  When I have problems, I use the chat feature, and for the most part, it's been very quick and easy to use. When we could still go into the library, I would also go into the library to the UITS help desk, which I found to be the easiest UITS process.  I know this already exists, but I think having more information on how to build good online courses would be helpful for faculty. Some of my faculty are aware of UITS resources but others are not.  I have had problems with classroom technology services, as we have a classroom in our office. However, that is in a residence hall, and there is always an argument over whether that is governed by UITS or the auxiliary team.  I need phone support. That has recently been difficult to get. I find the Knowledge Base totally overwhelming and thus useless!  My experiences with the UITS staff have consistently been very positive, and every time I have brought up a problem which is solvable, I am impressed by how quickly it is addressed. When the problem is not solvable, the UITS staff are always courteous and offer alternative options. I also attended a workshop last spring right before IU shifted online, and found the introduction to Zoom and Kaltura particularly helpful during a stressful period.  I have also been very happy with most services/software offered, especially IUCAT. I have had some issues (which are perhaps not 'solvable') with certain programs like Microsoft Outlook, which create frequent headaches due to running slowly on my computer or not consistently applying rules I set up to organize my inbox. There are a number of other programs which have minor issues or could have clearer user interfaces, but overall I think the services provided are very good, and I greatly appreciate the work of the UITS staff!  Remote guidance is difficult. Sometimes, I feel like I get sent a link or documentation that I've already found but am having trouble implementing. Sometimes, I'd like more help.  The entire student center service via one.iu is cumbersome and frustrating to use. The app structure of one.iu is also confusing. Both should be redesigned.  As always, my answer will be that, from the user perspective, it's hard to know what is a \"UITS\" and what is an LSP issue. But I'll add this year the double-edged sword of the introduction of MS Teams/SharePoint/OneDrive/GoogleDrive over the past few months. These tools add incredible flexibility but their rollout was not very well supported with information or training opportunities. As a result, all units are trying to figure out what to use for what purpose without any guidance. Do you set up a Team in MS Teams or a Group in SharePoint (what's the difference)? Why are we using OneDrive for sharing when it is meant for personal files, with sharing through Teams/SharePoint Libraries? That's just one of a zillion areas where users could use guidance.  Generally good experience with UITS though sometimes I feel like I get the runaround. CITO sends me to UITS, and UITS wants me to go back to CITO. Some recent problems are still unresolved because everyone thinks it is someone else's responsibility.  I have had a hard time downloading and using software or applying for license for EndNotes.  UITS changes to Microsoft exchange were poorly managed; info for Mac users was misleading both on what you could do before, and what you had to do after. Until a late change, website implied you could amend the existing account settings, which was not true. The initial instructions also suggested you could change the settings in advance, which was also not true.  What is generally excellent is the UITS call line - apart from the Bohemian Rhapsody waiting tune. Responders are generally very knowledgable and very helpful.  While I realize that UITS had extensive extra work due to Covid, all of us have. This year has been made far more stressful and unproductive due to the failed transfer of files from Box. Mine were tried 2X, and I am left with having to manually transfer enormous amounts of files, or have my Research Associate stop what he is doing and help me. Some of my files are for me alone and are not meant to be shared; the sharing is not very flexible. Further, many servers have been moved here and there, and new policies for printing were in the mix, i.e. nothing staying stable for months with Covid on top of this!  It is very difficult to figure out how to organize enormous amounts of research and teaching data with the new system. The security is far more difficult to implement than might be expected. More thought needs to be given to methods of storing and transferring sensitive or critical data, and not just to tell people that they must protect these data. Give tools that are robust!  A few years ago, it had been agreed that there would be minimal software changes without faculty buy-in first, but there are several rollouts of administrative systems. Some of these have training that is likely to be needed. This is too much extra work, given that everything that I do takes more time than usual.  Working remotely is impacted by the uncontrollable upgrades to my desktop. It has to be restarted by someone in the building. For many months, almost no one was in the building. It is not just my computer.  The model used to build our computers was said to be based on the one for the clerks at the front desk in the Evansville Nursing School, rather than reflecting teaching and research at IUB. We have spent considerable time on the issues of what software can be installed, leaving lab computers running long enough to finish an experiment, etc. Assuming that the Dean is the appropriate person to understand computer difficulties is counterproductive. A hierarchical structure with a Dean's approval on technical computer issues and feedback from the Dean is not working. I do not know how things stand as of today because my lab research is on hold.  The Canvas aspects of the UITS help have been successful. Covid has interrupted the good work on this.  I am not as big a fan of Kaltura, since the lack of accessibility that is a major reason to not use other products is not fixed by this, i.e. the visuals that may be difficult for people with low vision are not edited. Making written audio transcripts from word slides that I read is a waste of my time. I do not see why we cannot use a standard product, i.e. learn only 1 piece of software for editing, such as Adobe Premiere.  I think some instructions of WCMS in the knowledgebase are not updated; sometimes, I cannot find the button, folder, or items on my side. That was really depressing, I followed steps 1 to 4, then on step 5, the folder did not exist, or did not look like the instructions. Like got stuck right in the middle.  Also, the Microsoft Outlook on my Mac never works as I want; the emails go to two different places (the iu.edu with Google and the indiana.edu with Outlook), which really bothered me for years.  I have had no experience with UITS staff because I have been off campus for the whole of last year.  So far I have not had any problems with any IT-related service. Everything works great.  There haven't been any negative experiences but I did wish there was a way that accessing this resource is easy. I can say I have no idea how I would go about asking for help if needed, off the top of my head. I would have to ask around, research before stumbling on help.  I have had good response from UITS staff always, from the more general questions that are answered by whoever is the Help Desk- chat, to the response I got to more specific and kind of stranger issues I had using Kaltura.  Generally good experiences. The real reason for taking this survey is to voice the annoyance at the choice of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" by Queen as a background music for those on hold. The lyrics go, \"Momma, I just killed a man, put a gun against his head, pulled the trigger, now he's dead...\" and also, \"nothing really matters\" as a recurring chorus. I cannot turn the music off, so I am forced to listen to this objectionable material until the line is open, which can be more than ten minutes. \"Nothing really matters\" is not what I want to be hearing when I am trying to untangle some issue with Canvas, and am on hold for a long period of time. This is IU, a known music school, ought we not do better than this?  You all may want to take another look at your survey format. Many questions which I would have ranked as 4 of 5, I seem to have ranked as 2 by the sequence of options presented. Somewhat dissatisfied = mostly satisfied (ought to be 4 and not 2), and somewhat satisfied = mostly dissatisfied, which ought to have been 2 and not 4 in the sequence from bad to good.  Positive and helpful, including a timely follow-up email to check on the status of my problem.  I have always had positive experiences with UITS staff except for one--and that was taken care of quickly. [IRD], [IRD], and [IRD] ROCK!  UITS has been pretty responsive  Please do not migrate anything in the middle of a very busy semester! Additionally, I have yet to find a UITS consultant who knows how to present information in plain English. Just having computer savants available does not customer service make.  Prompt response time  My experiences with UITS have always been positive, professional and solution-oriented.  No negative interactions, but it has been hard to get in contact with them. The phone number is difficult to find, and submitting a ticket consistently takes over a week, which is not helpful as an instructor who is usually dealing with immediate tech issues for a class. Since we're all remote and can't just walk over to Wells anymore, it would be helpful if you expanded your remote help options and made them more obvious and easy to find.  The staff have been very helpful the few times I have contacted them.  7/24 chat Box is really helpful.  I have had experience with the phishing team, and they have been prompt and very helpful. Given the pandemic, I have been at home since March and have not had other occasion to call on UITS for help.  Positive experiences: all staff at CITL for their knowledgeable help; some long-time support staff at the Bloomington IT Support Center who help faculty with setting up courses on Canvas. Some dedicated staff at STC.  Concerns and negative interactions, both from myself as well as reported by students in courses I teach: many interactions with some Bloomington IT Support Center staff who did not seem to know anything about specific UITS-provided services and systems, nor even know to whom to direct questions and support.  Recommendations: provide knowledgeable support for all systems and services offered by UITS, not just the main ones. For example, non-Microsoft based services don't seem to have almost any knowledgeable staff supporting them. Specifically, having one single knowledgeable person in charge of all system administration for Mac systems on the Bloomington campus seems to point to a completely neglected endeavor.  Finally, very often often the response from UITS is to contact the \"local IT support\" for help, e.g. from the department or school. Unfortunately, this oftentimes results in no help at all. The process of delegation and intermediaries quite simply does not work as it should - the time it takes to get any response may take days, weeks, and in specific situations I personally witnessed, months went by without ANY response to requests for support related to UITS-provided services for regularly scheduled courses.  The old exchange web platform was great. The new Microsoft office Outlook web platform is [REDACTED]. It looks terrible, it is super slow, and its functionality is way worse than before. Examples: the calendar is not well integrated and opens in a separate tab requiring several more clicks, the search feature does not sort things by date as one would naturally expect but uses some kind of bizarre algorithm that tells me that the 'top results' for my query are those in my trash can that I have already deleted, or it finds emails I sent four years ago rather than ones from yesterday, and other smaller things such as marking items as read when you switch between folders. I have no need of whatever extra functionality that this new interface is supposed to provide, but I would suggest providing the option to return back to the old exchange web portal.  The biggest improvement this year for me was the addition of Lynda / Linked In Learning again. That's game changing for the kinds of courses I teach where students need to learn a technology and the resources and time for me to make and maintain videos on all that is a non-starter.  The new email is good - I find it annoying how much it bings at me and wish I knew how to turn that off, but I appreciate that upgrade.  Beyond the email though, Microsoft - enh. I didn't care for Box that much either, but have no plans to use the new Microsoft, or plan to use it as little as possible. The Google tools are just better and more intuitive, and I don't have to teach students how to use them because they came in from high school knowing that for the most part.  Changes to Canvas this year have been really helpful.. especially in how assignments are muted/released, and I appreciate the work CITL did in setting up templates for us as we all moved online.  I have had limited but positive interaction with UITS. Most of my interactions re: IT are with CITO, which I believe is completely different from UITS. But on the few occasions, mostly related to help sorting out IT in classrooms, where I have called UITS, you all have been extremely helpful, prompt, and clear. Very high satisfaction already!  My one major complaint relates to Zoom's reporting feature. For all of its capabilities and data capture, it is remarkably difficult for me to get longitudinal attendance data for my online classes. (I have to go to the report for each class period, download the data, import it into a single Excel file, sort it, and organize it.) In contrast, it seems like it would be quite easy for Zoom to be able to generate an attendance report since my class is a recurring Zoom meeting. If it is possible to actually do this, I have not heard about it despite inquiring with CITO. (Maybe I should have been inquiring with UITS!?)  I also rated wireless connectivity on campus low (\"relatively dissatisfied\") because about half the time, my phone does not seem to connect automatically to EDU-ROAM when I'm on campus.  I have had pretty good support from UITS staff when I've reached out, primarily via the chat service that is provided. I only had a frustrating experience one time, and that was probably due to my not explaining my issue very well over chat.  I had a wonderful experience when communicating and engaging with UITS staff. No complaints whatsoever.  My main issues are with email. I'll withhold opinion on the brand new platform as I've just migrated, but I know little about how to access Gmail, and it says I cannot access Gmail through IU. At the moment I think I'd rather use this platform for its features and accessibility over Outlook.  I have no idea about this topic..things just appear about changes being made. Half the time, I don't know if they are relevant to me or not. I try to deal with all of this as best I can. Anytime I have tried to call the help line, it was either busy or closed or something (which is not my preferred way to get the changes done anyway). Thank goodness my unit has its own tech support team that is WONDERFUL.  UITS staff have helped me with a number of log in and outage problems over the years. I have not had negative experiences with them.  UITS is generally friendly and helpful. I don't know why they had to migrate email the week that everyone was coming back to campus this spring, but generally speaking, UITS is great.  No  Our research group (lab) relies on numerous services provided by UITS. We have often needed to reach out for assistance. For the most part, people respond quickly and positively, but there have been occasions when this has not been the case  I have huge concerns about the timing of the big IT changes that impacted faculty, staff, and students this year. They retired Box and moved all cloud storage right before the toughest semester start, with COVID teaching formats and challenges in the Fall 2020 semester. Then, they migrated email at the beginning of the 2021 semester when we are all still facing the extra challenges of covid teaching. It's like UITS is out of touch with their audience. This created extra stress and confusion during a very challenging teaching year. Also, I wish we had more support to deal with the technology issues and changes for face-to-face teaching this year.  Very quick to respond to support tickets!  The support from the School of Public Health IT is outstanding. I do not call on university UITS very often. When I have they have been quick to respond with a solution. I have used the Knowledge Base several times and find the information very useful in solving issues.  Chat support.  Please hire more experienced IT staff to be more competitive for fixing issues in an efficient way. We might cut other unnecessary \"logistics\" staff as they seem to be more than needed. But we are in short of technical staff.  I've always had good experiences with UITS.  I appreciate the 24-hour availability and generally brief wait times for assistance by phone.  IU's ongoing promotion of e-texts and related proprietary platforms seems to me way overboard and not mindful of the ways that students may learn more effectively with physical texts.  It's been mixed for me. When I first came to IU, I initially had a fair bit of help. But it dried up after that. Fortunately, when newer colleagues arrived, they got the help I had hoped for, to the benefit of all.  UITS is usually very helpful when needed.  Classroom technology varies greatly across campus; some rooms have no computers while others have touch boards. I wish it wasn't so disparate across buildings. I would often have issues with WiFi connectivity on campus. IUanyWare also posed many problems with the Citrix receiver and trying to use apps through IUanyWare. I do really appreciate that those programs are available to use on personal computers through that service; it is just often difficult to use.  UITS has always been very attentive and quick when responding to my needs. Particularly when I had issues with the Kaltura recordings of my face to face classes.  UITS staff really helped me a lot to set up wifi in my on-campus apartment.  I've had productive experiences with staff members when setting up my email and troubleshooting why it wasn't working/ setting up properly for me. I felt like the UITS staff members at times provided me with more information than my department could.  I've mostly had very positive experiences with UITS! Of the many support experiences I've had, only one stands out as not great because the support staffer did not seem to understand my problem and simply told me to restart my computer/clear the cache and cookies (which I had already done prior to reaching out). Otherwise, staff is attentive, responds quickly, and are very knowledgeable. They don't give up on an issue even when the problem becomes more complicated then they think, and they are very polite. Overall, very pleased with my interactions!  I have called the UITS number for help with Canvas (I am an instructor and a student had an issue with an assignment upload). The staff member I spoke to was extremely helpful and gave me the information I needed to resolve the issue in just a few minutes. This was only a week ago, and it was a very positive experience.  I was able to borrow a Macbook Pro as an instructor. The response was quick and really helpful.  Nope  I have had useful professional assistance from UITS staff with regards to e-mail configuration on the movement of emails to Exchange, etc. and in solving problems with Zoom.  UITS staff and services are prompt and good. The staff is knowledgeable. I do not have any complaints.  It would be nice to see more sanitizer/wipes available throughout the STC's in Wells Library. They seem to be all located near the entrances, which makes it less likely that folks will sanitize before leaving.  It's also notoriously difficult to get local/classroom support since practically none of our classroom equipment is managed by UITS. Instead, it's handled by an LSP who manages all of the stuff within the Colleges of Arts and Sciences (at least that's my understanding), and since they're understaffed, you can't call them. If you miss a call from them, you can't call them back either, which is infuriating. I know it's not anyone's fault, but it makes it next to impossible to get even the most basic issues fixed in the same business day.  N/A  I have only needed to call UITS for help once, but the person I spoke with was very helpful. Also, all alerts from UITS about transferring email systems were helpful.  UITS has been enormously helpful. The hotline has often solved issues with both dispatch and unending patience.  I have nothing to add.  Mainly positive interactions with UITS staff and services. Thank you! Transition to online modalities was difficult, and responsiveness took a bit longer, but that was understandable.   ### Staff responses:  All my issues were attended well and resolved.  I think IU has a great IT crew. Working at the student health center [IRD] has helped me on numerous occasions. I have enjoyed being able to access some free online learning in regards to Excel.  Out of all the places that I have worked in my life, and this includes my time working in the military and for the DoD, Indiana University by far has the best Internet and Computer Technology team out there. They are vary valuable with a breadth of information about just anything you may ever have questions for, and if they can't answer it, they find the answer or get you to the person who can answer it without bouncing you around like a ping pong ball to 10,000 people just to get the answer to \"restart your computer and it will all work again\". I thank you for that because it is a tremendous time and life saver.  My experience with this department has been great. They are friendly, helpful, and respond promptly.  Overall I've had a pleasant experience using UITS services.  Zoom has been reliable while I work at home. I don't feel like I'm made aware of updates leading up to, or after the updates. The updates have all been helpful, but I've usually had to spend more time than I need to troubleshooting small issues that arise with updates.  The Box Migration happened during a really inopportune time. The beginning of the year was extremely stressful, and the migration happening at that time added stress unnecessarily.  Every experience I had with UITS has been positive. My one criticism is that in April/May, response times were slow, but that's understandable with everybody transitioning to working from home.  In my job (IU Press) I receive many complaints about the Buy.IU interface and difficulty of navigation (especially for individuals who must register as suppliers), but personally I haven't had any issues with it. If possible, I think some kind of reform should be made to make the site more accessible to individuals who need a one-time payment for their professional services.  I've enjoyed working with the individuals who set up, install and deliver software/hardware  My experience is almost 100% satisfaction; rarely does my IT question get unresolved. I've been here  3.5 years, and I have been VERY pleased!  When I contact my UITS staff in Bryan Hall, they are always professional, courteous, answer all of my questions, and then they ask me if there is anything else they can do for me or do I have questions about their visit.  I always begin with Knowledge Base when I have a question, and usually that answers it.  I've had positive experiences with UITS staff overall. They've been friendly enough, attentive to needs, and knowledgeable.  My interactions with UITS have always been positive.  UITS response is typically fast. However I often get confused with UITS and my school IT services, not fully understanding who to contact when, what emails are important, etc.  I would say about half of the time when I call in, it is helpful. Sometimes I just get referred to KB or to my unit's IT pro.  I thought the roll out of Teams, etc. was done poorly. No one seems to know how to use it including our IT. It seems like whenever some new technology or update is done, we are just expected to figure it out while we try to continue to do our jobs.  On-site IT services for staff in my building are responsive, helpful, and polite.  Outstanding service and professional and polite service.  I feel neutral about UITS and have no suggestions for new services or improvements.  All positive experiences.  Recommendations: find a replacement for FootPrints. Maybe consider something like Freshdesk.  I have no complaints at this time.  UITS staff has always been very helpful and responses address my questions and concerns quickly and efficiently.  none  The IIDC technology staff are awesome. I do not have any recommendations for improvement for the services they provide.  Overall I believe UITS provides superior support and services. As we see instructional modalities continuing to shift to a combination -- in-person, hybrid, and online -- it will be imperative that IU and IUB find ways to ensure those who are negatively impacted by the digital divide receive assistance.  I will say that since we have moved to Tech Select, I have been quite impressed with the way that Tech Select has taken on its role and working to fix our needs quickly and efficiently. I have had several problems, and they have taken care of them in a very professional and timely manner.  The biggest problem we had this year was the migration to IU print service. It gave us a lot of headaches for a few days, but this was not a problem Tech Select; it was the printing service.  In general UITS support staff is very helpful. I prefer to call support rather than email because I think it can be easier to work through a tech issue. Perhaps there could be a way to have a \"call back\" system so you don't have to wait on hold for a long time when call volume is high. But I've always been satisfied with staff even if I've been waiting. If the classroom support IT people are also someone I can evaluate in my comments, I would like to give them rave reviews. I've dealt with one person in particular, [IRD], who has been exceedingly helpful and willing to accommodate.  I'm not sure if this is part of UITS purview, but there is one frustrating thing that happens with university computers, where you get a notification saying your computer is going to restart in X number of minutes, and you can either snooze (which doesn't push the restart back) or restart right away. Totally understand the need to update the computer, but it seems a little aggressive to not be able to postpone.  I have been at IU for 35 plus years. I have never had an unsatisfying call to the help line. (5-6789) In addition the IT team within my department is excellent in maintaining and making sure that I have the IT needs- hardware and software--that I need to fulfill the IU and departmental mission. Thank you very much!  Regarding the focus group question. I don't think I am tech savvy enough to assist in that regard.  Things change so quickly it's challenging to keep up with it all and remain efficient.  The knowledge base is a fantastic resource. IT Chat has been very helpful in the past, as well.  One concern that was brought up just this week was the migration of Email. This is taking place right as classes are starting, and it would have helped if it had taken place prior to the semester starting. Also, my Director and Ast. Director are being migrated this week while I am not. So now our calendar sharing function will not work correctly until my migration takes place. Better planning of office wide accounts taking place together would have been helpful.  I was a bit disappointed by the confusion surrounding the exchange migration. Our departmental IT person had to send three separate follow-up emails with extra information with details of how we needed to make the migration happen. It was pretty technical stuff, and I was surprised by the lack of institutional support.  I feel like UITS shares information via e-mails very well. I feel informed.  The migration away from Box has introduced significant workload for our research center this year. We appreciate the support we have found, but could use more. Training for staff on Google Drive, best practices for organizing our folder structure in Drive, and a dedicated point person we could contact specifically about the migration would all be/have been very useful for us. These resources might exist, but we have had difficulty finding them.  Always have positive experiences working with [IRD] and [IRD]on renovations of spaces. They are great!  Interactions with staff are always productive. They go above and beyond to help in any way they can. They don't mind clarifying details or working through follow-up questions (simple or difficult). Even more importantly, I appreciate that they never seem condescending or exasperated. It has to be a tough job, so kudos to the frontline staff. We're lucky to have them.  Improvements: I wish more attention and training would be given to how software interacts across systems. For example, we are beginning to use Microsoft Teams, but we find limitations for our department. Not enough in-depth training about how to manage our data so files aren't duplicated on our server vs. One Drive, etc. IU Office 365 seems to have programs like Microsoft Project, Whiteboard, etc., but our department doesn't seem to be able to access many of those programs.  I have always had positive, helpful, and timely responses from UITS.  As we have moved to many online video and shared file storage platforms, training in these areas have been limited prior to rollout. Our organization is working to catch up.  For the love of all things good, the loss of productivity and time due to the Box migration into the land of the Wild, Wild, West of Microsoft and Google could have paid to keep Box a part of our file storage and collaboration for the next several years. This is our department's number one nightmare - aside from COVID issues, if that tells you how disruptive it has been.  Something that our dept would find helpful would be to make sure all LSP's and Support Services are fully aware and trained in any upcoming change, and then an email to us users could be 'dumb- downed' a bit for those of us who do not know the lingo. Some emails make it sound like we need to do something right away, but it doesn't always apply to each person so better explanations would be ideal. Thanks!  One suggestion would be someone in UITS with expertise with Macs.  All in person and email communications have been very helpful. Sometimes working on the work PC, needing admin help for common programs like adobe acrobat, Microsoft, skype/Lync, and printer drivers gets to be a little tedious. It would be great when setting up the new machines to have all those and other common programs listed as to-dos for the turn over cycles.  Every interaction I have had with UITS staff and services has been positive. Staff reply promptly to help resolve any issues or answer questions. If the issue is complex, there is always willingness to chat over phone or Zoom. The only exception to this is TechSelect. They are slow to respond, and it often takes a manger or director to contact them to \"light a fire\".  The decision to migrate to different platforms--for example IU Box, and IU email migration was done with no concern for how it would be disruptive to the people who use those tools.  The process to purchase software in the School of Education is very time consuming and a waste of time for all involved. The $120 upgrade I recently purchased was paid with the p-card after weeks of waiting for multiple approvals.  Wouldn't know what to do without UITS!!! Very thankful for all that help us!  Our IT support group is always very helpful and knowledgeable.  I've had very positive experiences with support during the transition to work from home.  However, I'm very, very frustrated with the transition away from Box. I feel like the timeline and messaging have been confusing, and we are being left without a truly equivalent replacement.  I am 100% pleased with my UITS interactions. I commend them for all the work helping us staff during the pandemic!  Though our school has embedded UITS support, I find that when I have issues it's much easier/faster to call 5-6789. The folks that work that support line are amazing. I've only had one or two times over the years where the person wasn't helpful or was short. Mainly I know I can call that number and the folks will really listen and try to help me.  Because our school has instituted tighter data controls than the University as a whole, I often struggle trying to do my collaborative work with others. It is very frustrating because the policy put in place does not allow for my work to be done in a satisfactory manner.  Well first off you all do a great job of keeping us up and running, especially during COVID. Kudos to all your efforts.  But really, during one of the most challenging times we have ever faced at IU, that's when UITS decides to move everyone out of Box and then to top it off, ask us to start using Microsoft Teams. It would have been very thoughtful if those quite disruptive moves could have been postponed for a year while we adjusted to this new way of teaching and learning.  Losing Box was not pleasant. I am still not satisfied with the replacement options and no guarantee that IU will not jump ship to another vendor next week.  I know the project work load appears very heavy right now and maybe at the worst time for that work load to be higher. With that said I feel the UITS Tier 2 response has still been very good, professional, and making every effort to keep things moving along.  The one improvement I would like to see is the continued efforts to provide IT Pros with project communications. For Example I feel the IUSecure wireless retirement and the transition to Eduroam could have been better. I know less people are using the wireless networks but even more reason to have communications about that service. With many IT Pros remote we are not always experiencing the same services as those that may be on campus. I feel the overall communications from Campus Network could be improved.  I have only had good interactions with UITS. I work remotely, and I lose connection to my desktop while on my laptop from home. This is usually something that happens regularly every day. There is nothing further to report.  I believe UITS does an excellent job! Every time I contact a UITS representative, the service is extremely helpful!  They have been very helpful and polite when I've had a need.  I have had almost all positive experiences with UITS! They are very helpful. I am still using a very old version of WCMS to edit my departmental website, and it's not even supported anymore by anyone so it can be super hard to get help with it. I basically had to find one person who will help me from time to time from IU Studios, and she is nice enough not to charge me for small questions, but it is very challenging. I know the College of Arts and Sciences is working on migrating everyone, but it seems like they don't have enough time or staff to do it very quickly.  I have generally have good experiences with UITS, though most of my IT interactions are through CITO. I think you've all done a phenomenal job in supporting us through a very difficult time moving to a virtual campus. I do, however, wish that there had been more instruction/guidance on the changeover from Box; my group did not use institutional storage beforehand, so trying to navigate and understand what our options are and what to choose has been a little frustrating. Still, I have a couple people from UITS/CITO helping me try to learn the systems and determine the best choice. It does help to have LinkedIn Learning available, since sometimes the UITS training options are few and far between for the topics I need.  Know what you want in the first round of development; you may never get another.  The chat with a UITS staff member function was very helpful when I was troubleshooting Canvas issues. They provided helpful advice; however, once our conversation was complete and the issue was marked resolved, our chat disappeared. I was not expecting that to occur so I was unable to save the instructions they provided to reference at a later time. This is something that I would recommend is changed so that the chat Box does not automatically close once the issue is marked as resolved.  I have no concerns or issues and have only had positive experiences with UITS staff in terms of service. The IT Staff with IU Athletics department is superior in terms of availability, service, and professionalism. Thankful to work alongside such knowledgeable and caring personnel.  None  I normally resolve computer issues with my department's IT department, but I occasionally access help from UITS. They have always been courteous and helpful.  Always have positive interaction with UITS staff when I call for support.  Concerns over the migration to Microsoft 365 for email. I haven't had to deal with it yet, but staff and faculty have.  It's not very easy to do on own--need assistance from our IT people to get it to work. Bad time of semester to migrate given emails were not working and needed to make contact and do Zoom meetings.  We are going through this email migration process currently, and it has been a pain. Our office is extremely busy right now, and due to the changing of emails, it took down our skype and therefore our ability to answer calls. Not everyone is tech savvy and doesn't understand what we need to do.  I NEED HELP LEARNING HOW TO OPERATE THE COMPUTER. CLASSES WHERE OFFERED A FEW YEARS AGO FOR THOSE THAT NEEDED HELP, AND I SIGNED UP BUT WAS NEVER CONTACTED.  I have not had to contact UITS in a very long time. Appreciate that you are there if needed, though.  All of my previous interactions with the CITO staff have been good. The personnel are very responsive, knowledgeable, and able to fix whatever problems I have had in the past.  TechSelect needs to be more responsive to phone calls or emails. Emergencies are treated almost the same as routine questions, instead of being highly prioritized and quickly resolved.  It seems UITS has been rolling out new processes (Office 365/Exchange Online) while most of us have been working from home due to Covid. This has led to confusion among staff who aren't always the most tech savvy. It would have been nice if additional instruction had been given besides saying your local IT person will help.  The folks with SCT2, the SCCM team, & IUB DNS Admins are great to work with. Whether I'm looking for assistance with accounts, DNS, SCCM or just have the random issue, they are polite & professional.  None at this time.  I deal with them when they need to do work on servers at our houses. It always goes well.  Is it VPIT or UITS? What should ya'all be called?  The Finance office folks are very nice. And, the people who've helped me from TechSelect are also very pleasant.ADVICE: Some of your TechSelect folks are about to burnout. They need more staff to carry the load. Please get HR exception and hire more people. The ones left are struggling. (My unit gets exception approval frequently. It can be done.) DATA WAREHOUSE: I need clear instructions on how to access the data. It would be nice to start putting out info to help people since many people are now trying to create in programs like Power BI.  I miss having free access to Lynda.com. So many options and levels.  Love my Adobe software, but I checked that option in the survey somewhat low because of it being in the Cloud. I'm old and feel more comfortable with something more concrete than a cloud. In the same vein, I'm missing my IU Box Sync . . . especially now that I'm working from home with a slower Internet service. Searching for images in the Cloud was excruciatingly slow! I prefer having my files on my computer (can view and find images quickly) and the Cloud being my backup. And, that IU Box Sync backed up my files automatically was a dream. I'm operating similarly with my Google Drive account: files on computer--except that I have to remember to back up the files, which isn't always dependable. This system also won't work well if and when I return to the office and need office and home computers with the same files. Maybe I can retire before then! My department required that some files be put on MS 0365 account, but it doesn't work well. I can't copy up files from my computer, but I did find that I can copy them from my Google Drive account to the 0365 account.  I use Mac Mail, but appreciate having access to OWA to set out-of-office messages.  I understand that IU had to leave Box for financial reasons.. and I am sure UITS is aware of the cost in terms of person hours to make that change themselves - but for the record, this has cost our group a lot of time (= money) as well to transfer, rearrange, retrain etc. to TWO new systems.  Pretty pleased with the stability of our video platforms. The transition away from Box for document sharing and storage has been problematic  Everyone is helpful, professional and positive.  I have not had any negative experiences with UITS.  I think OnBase could use some upgrades; I don't like how it times out after few minutes of not being in use, lets you do everything, and when you get to save gives you an error. This is only one issue of many I have noticed.  No  I keep losing my secure signature in Outlook during power outages and surges. Am not sure what to access to get this back.  I've always had great experiences with UITS. They swoop in in my moment of desperate need and then *poof*, problem solved.  I appreciate the educational efforts UITS has put forward during the pandemic. The videos and tutorials on how to use Zoom, etc., have been very helpful. My only complaint is unrelated; when there are outages, it is often quite a while before they are reported on the UITS status page.  This is in response to the question below about participating in the UITS focus group. I just want to say I do work remotely. So anything I could help with from home I would be willing.  The majority of my interactions with IT at IU are with EITS. The professionals in that department are  excellent stewards of my individual tech needs and the needs of the office in which I work. No complaints or recommendations for improvement!  We rarely interact directly with UITS staff because over many decades at our lab we either had IT people or worked with RSTS or now Tech Select.  My biggest complaint over the years has been that UITS encourages safe practices to best avoid loss of data & privacy yet encourages the use of Google services, when Google is the biggest criminal organization involved in such information theft on the planet!  I have always had excellent interactions and support from our IT professionals. Timely resolution of issues and quick turnaround on requests.  I have had almost entirely excellent experiences with UITS support staff over the phone. So much better than the vast majority of technical support offered by most companies. Even when I have stumped the person with my problem initially, they have been patient and well-resourced to dig deeper and find an issue, and they're not condescending. I think the whole team who is answering calls should be celebrated.  The only thing I can think of right now is that there should be more locations for getting the token for logging on to your email or other IU sites. A lot of my staff don't use computers on a regular basis. So, they either misplace or lose their token and then have to go to the Library to get another one. We have a UITS computer lab here in the IMU, and it would make it easier to for them to get a token here.  Offering more classes on computer basics would be helpful.  I appreciate the complexity of maintaining a secure network with the diversity of needs across the IU campuses. However, the customer service interactions generally are bad, and the failure of UITS to understand its roll generally as a supporting unit and instead drives processes that it does not own. The lack of problem solving and innovative thinking I've observed from my UITS interactions is disappointing. Instead, the response I get are rigid and condescending. The technology that I use should support the work that I do; the work I do should not support the technology. Often it feels like the tail is wagging the dog.  UITS has helped with getting students through creating a guest account for Canvas and quickly answering questions that the students have had for the classes I teach. They are quick and help out, quicker than I can get back with students, and the problem has been solved and students share it took a matter of minutes.  I have participated in the IU Online annual trainings, and I am grateful for those, and it helps me to stay up to date on current trends, best practices, and all with technology.  UITS help to educate and keep me up to date as well on Phishing to keep me and the university and students safe. I am very thankful for these reminders, updates, tests, and communications.  The one continuing frustration we have is the 24 hour wait period between a student creating the IU IT account and being able to login with that information. Our program works with high school students, and it would work best if they didn't have this delay.  I have never had a negative interaction, I have had to wait a few days for a response a couple of times, but understand that instant responses are not always possible, especially with our current work environment.  I really liked Box and how it was so easy to organize and share files with my coworkers and keep things nice and tidy. We have not figured out a way to access and organize things as easily in One Drive.  Your job is not easy, as you deal with lots of \"issues\" and time constraints, but you are appreciated!  Lack of good Linux/Unix workstation support. 90% of my tasks require this, so I end up running two machines to run the mandated Microsoft Software.  Red Desktop is wonderful! Best computing interface - easy for everyone. IU Anywhere is getting better. Wish there was a brief description or link to a page that quickly describes the purpose of the installed applications - something like IUware. Also it would be GREAT if IU added Globus connectivity for Google Drive ( Globus Google Drive Connector).  I will first say that every person at UITS I have interacted with has been friendly and helpful. My only negative is that the SSSP approval process is unpredictable--sometimes almost instant, and sometimes a few months. The process seems like a \"black Box\" and it's difficult to know what is happening with a request, why it's delayed, etc.  My only thought is that there have been a lot of changes recently that have been even more complicated because we are working from home. Things like moving from Box to Teams or migrating to a new email provider may seem like they are simple steps for us to complete, but it is just harder and more complicated with us working from home and not meeting as we normally would. Hopefully these changes will make next year easier and less cumbersome. I will say, I do enjoy the use of teams more than Box!  Generally very satisfied with IT support and services, although too many system replacements/upgrades where little or no notice given and glitches in productivity result due to either inadequate testing before implementation or lack of adequate explanations to prepare users for uninterrupted services. It would be great if central offices better engaged the university community in  plans for these type of upgrades/revisions, particularly in the realm of administrative systems.  Maybe this resource exists and I just haven't come across it, but it's become very confusing to understand the differences between, and intersections or overlaps among, OneDrive, Teams, SharePoint, IU Google Drive, OneNote. Frankly, at least part of the difficulty is due to confusing rollout processes which never seemed to explain the latter factors, and the subsequent conflagration of seemingly competing storage and information management options; which explains why I mentioned OneNote above: the new Teams and other software seem to overlap with previously available software, which made it additionally difficult to understand what software to use for what. All too often the answer seems to be, \"Talk with your unit's tech support.\" This is a legitimate referral, of course, but it's inadequate. UITS could do a better job of contextualizing apps, sites, and related features in relation to other apps, sites, and related features. It isn't enough to just provide a brief description or a few isolated, siloed bullet points of features of a given app.  As I went thru the survey I noticed there are services I didn't even know existed; for example, apparently I can somehow create a personal webpage and have it on the IU server? I subscribe to The Monitor but rarely read much of it because there just isn't much there and it's boring to look at. Wouldn't The Monitor be a great place to make people aware of services like the ability to create your own website thru IU services? I also wasn't aware there is a Report Phishing Outlook plugin, and when I did a Google search for it nothing helpful came up. (Is the Knowledge Base mapped in Google?? Whether UITS likes it or not, I think most people go to Google, and fewer people think to go to Knowledge Base search.)  By the way, Tableau is god-awful. It's too complex, too big, too difficult to use and navigate. I would love to look up how many students changed majors and to what in a given chunk of time, or what the average GPA arch is for students in major X or Y after they transfer in to IU; but I'm not a data miner, nor is it my job to be. It isn't enough to supply a bunch of data. There need to be infinitely easier ways for staff and faculty to simply ask for certain institutional data and be supplied with the answer or information, instead of being told, \"Go to this very dense and complicated data site or Tableau object and find it yourself.\" And I don't think lobbing that one to unit IT is the answer. They have their hands full already.  Generally, really good service and UITS staff. No problem and everyone is reactive.  It would be good to have an option/explanation on how to share easily calendars between IU Outlook, IU Gmail calendar, and external Gmail/Outlook calendar. It is confusing and complicated.  The past year and semester was full of positive experiences with UITS staff. I work in the IMU with meeting services, and with the implementation of academic classes in the building, my staff called upon UITS staff to help with tech issues in the classroom. They were quick to respond and help us get and keep the classes running smoothly. It was simple to get into contact with someone, know when they could make it to the building, and know that the issue was going to be fixed. Thank you UITS Staff!  I have always been impressed by the friendless of every interaction I've had with UITS staff. I am starting my 3rd year here as an IU Bloomington employee, and I know that I have not even scratched the surface of the resources and benefits you guys have to offer. I know it's on me to take the time and do the research on your website to see what's available. So I'd say, anything you can do to make  digesting all the stuff you guys do and have to offer for staff would be helpful for slackers like me.  I'm not sure if TechSelect should be included here? When I have submitted a ticket and used their services, I have been extremely satisfied, pre- and post- pandemic.  Regarding managing technology remotely, I have felt out on my own. I've had to study KB and other resources to educate and troubleshoot for myself (I'm still not sure I'm receiving updates for my computer - there's no WIFI servicing the area so I don't always connect to VPN, does this matter? Not sure. Who do I ask?). Microsoft Storage/ Microsoft Secure Storage start up and implementation has seemed a bit confusing, and I know Outlook Exchange is coming, so Microsoft Teams will need to be learned.  I search through the Monitor for info, not always knowing if it is applicable to me. The targeted emails have been the best.  While I'm sure there are many things that UITS does very very well, all I can think about is how frequently the UITS-owned printers have issues, and how poor the UITS assistance is when this happens.  I had a positive interaction with UITS staff today when I called the help desk for questions on the exchange migration.  it's difficult to get things done as needed without in-person visits.  I was wondering if it is possible to get an institutional license for Overleaf, which is a collaborative LaTeX writer. I noticed that both the Luddy School and Purdue have such licenses.  I have never fully understood the costs associated with services provided by UITS, especially as they involve researchers. How are researchers and/or their academic units expected to pay for services that should be at the core of what UITS provides? The services provided by UITS are extremely hard to understand. A lot of technical talk, but practical, on the ground application to researchers is severely lacking.  The UITS help desk (5-6789) is always extremely helpful. They are able to provide guidance in a timely manner.  I don't have any negative experiences really; however, I have had a security review that has been in- process for a year with very little updates. I can't imagine how many security reviews there are, but I do think if there was a place where users could log in and see the status easily that might be beneficial (especially if you need additional information).  More autonomy in terms of the individual computer and email account usage would be highly appreciated.  More Wifi outdoors around campus.  My experiences with UITS (and/or AIT) staff have always been positive. There was some confusion when I initially brought my entire work set-up home about how UITS could support me remotely, but I brought my computer to the UITS building so the issue could be fixed.  Wow. Didn't realize UITS's reach until completing this survey! I have some small grumbles about the way things work/don't work well, such as: recently, the asymptomatic testing registration site said there were no available appointments (for the entire week of January 25), which just seems unbelievable. I wish there was a reason why there were no appointments.  I miss Box. I don't like OneDrive. It's not easy to figure out and/or share files with colleagues. Perhaps it'll take time to adjust to it. Box was intuitive; OneDrive hasn't been, so far. Further, once I set up OneDrive, every time I want to save a file, the \"recent locations\" pop-up Box defaults to a small subset of these OneDrive file locations, not the usual ones on the LAN. It's extra clicking just to put files where my department stores them.  There's been a lot of technology changes. You've tried to break down the changes step-by-step and explain why changes are happening, which has been helpful. It's still annoying, though (because of the pandemic conditions). I'm never really sure I've done things correctly. For example, I think I did the Outlook thing last week, but now I can't see the preview out of office messages from colleagues like I used to.  Several of the services that I use daily have been inconsistent in the work-from-home environment.  I'm one of those people who doesn't care about technology until it doesn't work. Alternately, I just want it to work without the hassle. I think UITS does a very good job. Whenever I have trouble and call the help line I always get terrific help. The one thing I find less useful is the knowledge base, which rarely answers my questions or helps me. So, I get a little frustrated when I'm directed to it.  Whenever I had computing issues that required assistance, I was helped quickly by UITS staff.  Overall, excellent support and services. Migration from Box to MS / Google was (and still is) extremely confusing and expected too much of end users. Communications around the migration to Exchange Online could have been better. Several of my peers missed the emails entirely and were shocked when their email wouldn't work on their computer or phone.  I am VERY disappointed with the way that Karst was decommissioned! The named replacement system was not ready when the licensing for Karst ran out. So, while I was waiting for information on the replacement system, there was NO communication with users about the status of Karst or its replacement and what to do. Really poor planning and communication on UITS' part!  Sometimes it's annoying to return to my desktop and find it's been reset overnight while I had procedures running in the background or a number of projects open.  So far, I have nothing but good things to say. Our reps at Tech Select are awesome. Christian and James both are helpful, and [IRD] has really helped me out a lot while working from home.  The knowledge base guidance on what web hosting or file sharing services should be used for which level of data classification (i.e. restricted, critical, etc.) needs to be standardized and improved.  For example, there are UITS training materials on their website that say that none of the IU-provided sharing services (Sharepoint, Teams, etc) should be used for work file even if they're non-restricted. That's contradicted by the knowledge base article about them.  A year or two ago, our center tried to contact IU data stewards to receive guidance on what web hosting services at IU were suitable for hosting a web application that collected restricted data. No one was willing to give us a clear answer other than \"use Redcap\" as they did not know enough about other IU systems to feel comfortable giving advice. There was no authority at IU that we could find to give a direct answer on this problem.  Our IT folks are amazing - patient and responsive despite having a significant amount added to their workload since COVID and needing to adjust to remote mgt.  I don't typically have communications with UITS except more recently due to completing the Software and Services Selection Process, which I'm not a fan of even though I understand some of the benefits for UITS and Purchasing. For me and my colleagues, it's just another speed bump, when there are some purchases we can't anticipate needing until we discover we need it and are on a tight deadline to get our deliverables for external sponsors completed.  I am very satisfied with UITS' level of service and expertise.  I always have to hunt for how to report IT security issues along with when I should report them. I didn't know there were tools to do this. Maybe I just haven't checked out UITS' new website lately??  All positive experiences  My only issues have been in determining who to contact at the various enterprise teams to get a new ticket started or to get my issue addressed in a timely manner.  Staff have always been friendly and helpful when I've called with an issue. One complaint I do have is the Knowledge Base website. It's very difficult to navigate, and I don't like how all steps for every method are listed on one page. I wish, for example, there was a button you could push for PC or one for Apple, or one for Firefox vs. Explorer. It's very wordy, too, and hard to understand for folks who aren't familiar with computers. When someone says \"just look at the Knowledge Base\" I know I'm in for 30-45 minutes of digging before I find my answer.  I can't recall having any negative interactions with UITS. In my experience, UITS has consistently provided prompt and effective assistance.  I am having continued issues with shared drives not connecting to my Surface laptop while working from home.  I would like to know why IU Google doesn't support a paid student subscription. I have tried to sign up for the student discount from YouTube, but Google says the IU organization does not allow for payment options. This is inconvenient, as I have to pay full price for the subscription even though  YouTube is a common resource for academics.  Knowledgebase support has been great for the most part. CAITS support have been confusing due to different instructions regards to how to submit the request (i.e. ticket system vs direct e-mail to respondent) and the time it takes to resolve the issue due to lack of supporting staff.  Always a great experience, and they are always kind and successful. Thank you so much  It's always been good.  I have always had positive help with UITS when I have called for help.  So far so good  I work with [IRD] and {IRD] on occasion to plan fiber installs to various buildings. They are always eager to meet and discuss potential paths to get service to the building. They are a pleasure to work with.  great service  My interactions with UITS has been routine and positive.  IU Mail works most of the time. Too many damn phishing tests. Jeez, do these highly paid admins have nothing better to do?  I haven't really needed to interact with UITS staff/services. The VPN worked great for the couple of months I was wfh, but now that I'm back in the office I haven't had need to interact much.  My biggest pain point was getting a new Mac laptop set up during the pandemic. It required nearly two hours in person with the TechSelect person getting everything configured. It seems like there has to be a better way to get everything installed and configured, with just a verification in person that everything looks good and physical handoff.  I have had nothing but negative experience with UITS/Tech Select in the past year. A more convoluted, impractical, and unfriendly system for solving issues I have rarely seen. No one seems to know how to get questions answered; workers assigned to my issue often do not have the appropriate permissions to fix the problem at hand. Re-think this awful Tech Select model because it isn't working.  UITS is very good at quickly responding to me when I need help. I do wish they would clarify the difference between an email with @iu vs @indiana. I used to think they were interchangeable but perhaps they are not.  Integrating IU Google forms has been somewhat challenging - some students were not familiar how/where to login prior the access or how to switch between personal Google and IU Google.  I wish that whoever makes these decisions in UITS would take some time before simply dropping (with essentially NO notice) applications or platforms used by faculty. The situation with Piazza - it's going to disappear; no it's not; yes it is) is unconscionable. I realize that the decision was about cost and data privacy, but dithering like that is simply inappropriate. And the migration to Outlook 365 was also very poorly planned, with long waits on the phone for help.  Most of my questions have been answered. Only a few in the past year that UITS could not, due to it being a Microsoft or personal PC issue.  N/A  I have had many positive interactions, especially when I have needed to connect our advocates (who are retired faculty and may not be as computer savvy) to UITS for assistance. Challenges have included being disconnected or having problems and getting back in touch with the original person I spoke with...especially this summer when I was having trouble with a new laptop that was provided by IU but wasn't set up to access any IU systems. That said, we were in the midst of a pandemic--nothing was usual and I understand this!  UITS staff have always seemed knowledegable when responding to concerns in our building.  In my particular circumstances, COVID 19 has greatly impacted my interactions with UITS services. I will complete the survey, but note that my experience over the past year has been greatly decreased and is not typical of my normal circumstances.  I do not have any problems.  Always helpful  UITS was able to assist me with getting a mifi remote internet Verizon jetpack, so I can successfully work remotely with decent internet.  UITS staff have always been enormously helpful- even when I come to them with the most basic issues. I've never had a concerning interaction with any staff member.  My overall experience with UITS is very positive, and the people in the group tend to be top-notch. However, as an IT-Pro one of my biggest concerns is the degradation in response times for SCT2 (sct2@iu.edu). I get the impression this group is understaffed, and I have seen response times slow to a crawl over the past year. I want to emphasize that my interactions with individual people on the back side of SCT2 are generally very positive, but the time to get an initial response to email queries can be several weeks, which is frustrating.  I think UITS is wonderful. It would be better if [IRD] was still working there, though.  I have had all good interactions with UITS staff and services. I have no recommendations at this time.  In the SoE, our IT support is called ETS. I'm not sure they are directly UITS staff.  I would like to see IU adopt Power BI online services as a next step in Microsoft products available for departmental or enterprise use.  I have always had positive interaction with UITS staff when completing work orders. Very helpful and punctual.  I really appreciate the live chat function, as I can multitask with meetings and/or teaching while I am trying to assess my concern.  Overall, I am pleased with my experience. However, I wish IU would have chosen ONE path for all of us to migrate to either Google or OneDrive. It is hard with multiple choices.  I also, seemingly randomly, lost access to my exchange webpage; I do not recall getting an email that this would not be supported and was in a bit of a pickle when I could not access my email anymore.  The UITS staff has always been helpful when I have used their services. I appreciate the resources they provide and the helpful guides on their websites, particularly the tips and tricks tech guide that  makes finding resources easy.  I've had nothing but positive interactions when UITS was needed.  In my position, I don't interact or need UITS often.  My biggest concern is that the service is inconsistent; I have had times when UITS was very prompt and effective in resolving my issue/problem. At other times, I am transferred between more than one person and - even after all of that - the issue is not resolved. Greater consistency in quality of service would make my overall experience with UITS very positive.  Most of my experiences have been with UITS staff that work in the O'Neill building. They are all fantastic. I have also worked with UITS staff to get help with getting locked out of my account on a regular basis.  When I started working remotely from home when the Pandemic started, I had abundant help from UITS setting up my computer and my connections.  [IRD] is a pleasure to work with. He has great customer service skills and he is willing to educate me along the way. What an asset to have as part of your team!  I try to avoid interacting with UITS as both an individual user of services and on behalf of research projects I manage. It seems the first response is always the user must be an idiot and doesn't know what they are talking about/reporting, followed by an admission that there was a problem but it can't be resolved by UITS and the user needs to do a LOT of manual fixes. Despite the seemingly good advance preparation for the migration from Box to OneDrive or Google, the migration was not smooth. For all of the dozens of shared Box folders I owned, NONE of the shared permissions migrated; and yet I received a report that the migration was successful and shared permissions were transferred. When I started receiving emails from people who could no longer access the folders, I reported it to UITS. The first response was condescending and gave me instructions for accessing the excel report that I had referenced in my help request. The second response was giving me instructions to give to the people with shared permissions on how to access the shared folders -- basically, another \"the end user is at fault\" assumption. Finally, on the third go-round, UITS staff acknowledged that I wasn't an idiot, and others were also reporting problems with the migration of shared permissions. The solution offered was for me to go through the excel report and reshare folders with all the previous users, or wait for them to complain and then share. There was no acknowledgment that the migration was botched, and no explanation for why the reports said that these permissions were transferred. So when UITS started rolling out the migration of Exchange accounts to Exchange Online, I knew to expect problems. Three years ago when I switched mobile phone providers, I started getting mail delivery system notices of non-deliverable messages to my AT&T account that no longer exists. Despite months of investigation by our local IT support personnel, this problem couldn't be resolved, and I continue to receive almost daily non-delivery messages. Expecting problems with the switch to Exchange Online, I used Exchange ActiveSync to connect my iOS phone to my Exchange account to test that it works-- I lost contact information (just phone numbers remained) for a handful of important contacts. Our local IT support staff couldn't explain/resolve the problem, so I deleted the account. When I actually migrated and was forced to configure my phone for Exchange Online, the same thing happened. I figured it would be a trip down the rabbit hole to contact UITS for help, so I'm still finding partial contact info and recreating the contacts. Unfortunately, notes on some of these contacts that were added over several years are permanently lost. I've also had experience with information security office reviews of vendor's data collection platforms conducted prior to finalizing contracts. No complaints about the professionalism of the staff and the thoroughness of the reviews, but these reviews caused a 4-mo delay in launching a study, even when no IU data was being transmitted -- the plan called for us to receive subject data collected into the vendor systems and then downloaded into secure data environments at IU for our researchers to analyze. My overall impression of UITS is that a lot of time and resources are spent on changing systems for back-end efficiencies with little apparent improvements in functionality for the end-user. When these system changes result in problems for the end-user (me), I'm not a happy camper.  Very quick responses.  UITS has been great to me. Every. Single. Time. Thank you!  Most of my experiences with UITS staff have been very professional and effective.  IT help is wonderful. However, many, many of the software applications are awful. One big, expensive one is Buy.IU.  For individual issues, I've had good experiences with technical support, although during the recent Exchange migration, it was impossible to get through on the phone, and I ended up being helped by CITO. It appeared they weren't well prepared for what to expect, which could point to a need for better communication between UITS and its campus partners. More generally for users, the relationship between UITS and CITO isn't clear, and UITS seems like such a huge organization that it can be hard to understand who does what if you have a problem that goes beyond individual user issues.  Kudos to IT Connections. It's my favorite campus newsletter. The stories are interesting even when I don't personally know the people involved.  My interactions with UITS staff have all been positive. Even when I am making bonehead mistakes, they are kind and patient and helpful.  Response time is improving greatly.  All positive experiences. Personnel have been very nice and helpful.  UITS has always been a great help.  They were able to help when I called with a problem.  When we had in-house UITS staff at the Student Health Center, I had excellent experiences with their responsiveness and assistance. Now that I have to file a ticket, wait for someone to contact me, and coordinate a time to work together remotely (or have them come over), it is much less convenient and is much more difficult to access assistance.  ICT2 support team is responsive, which is appreciated.  Box transition was well advertised, but the confusion introduced by the mix of OneDrive, SharePoint, and the entanglement of the MS suite is frustrating to end-users, who are often seeking/expecting solutions from the account owners. Especially frustrating to group accounts nestled within UITS ownership due to data security.  The knowledge base is extremely helpful and I reference it quite often in my work. When I find faculty who want a bit more specific help, I can go to the knowledge base, learn how to do a task, and the relay it back - so very helpful!  The switch from Box happened at a seemingly inconvenient time, but now that instructors have automatic access through IU to GoogleDrive, the timing was actually great. The GoogleDrive works well with Canvas, and the fact that IU had already started that switch made working with instructors on integrating documents from their drive into Canvas much easier! You provided so many helps and webinars preparing everyone for the switch, that at least on our end, it seemed to go over very smoothly and no one was surprised. Well done!  I have not directly interacted with any UITS staff that I am aware of.  None at this time  I haven't had any interaction with the UITS staff.  Most of my experiences have been positive. There have been only one or two times when there seemed to be a delay in getting a hold of someone by phone.  I have had nothing but positive experiences. Thank you for the help, it's greatly appreciated.  Excessively confident and empty messaging largely in contrast to the much more frustrating reality of how various things like migrations (Exchange Online, Box, etc.) actually roll out. It's definitely very difficult to anticipate details and potential problems, even ones one might reasonably expect to be anticipated, but one might wish for the triumphant language of the messaging to stop. When the reality is not so triumphant, it perhaps doesn't help? But I also want to say thank you for all the tireless work that individuals must have put in to help with the increased tech-reliance due to COVID - it must have been an enormous undertaking — very grateful. (Please do not extract that one sentence for quotation, thank you.)  Advocating same message for years: hire more staff and pay them what they are worth. Working harder and with less staff is taking its toll. UITS promotes tools such as JAmf and SCCM with very little back end support in real time.  I have had positive and negative experiences with UITS. I have had people that would go the extra mile and not give up until the problem was solved even if they had to go further or to someone else to obtain the answer. And I have had combative reps that want me off the chat.  My experiences are typically limited to the Exec IT team.  None  Our biology technical support staff in the Biology building is fantastic! Always knowledgeable and beyond helpful! [IRD] and [IRD] are the best!  The migration from IUBox was really disruptive and frustrating. I understand this change was to save money but the time spent by our lab ensuring we didn't lose any files in the transfer was significant. If this happened across the entire campus, I wouldn't be surprised if the time lost to this task cost more than the new storage system.  My interactions with UITS staff have been great; they are helpful and kind.  The switch to office 365 sucks, as my computer did not accept it, and I spent way too much time  getting a loaner, and everything was hard to set up without tech help in person. I was very frustrated, even with their help, after I got home and had issues.  I love the Knowledge Base. It's not perfect--sometimes I can't find what I need or the wording isn't super clear--but most of the times it has exactly what I need in easy-to-digest language. Keep up the great work!  I also think communications from UITS have been great. Particular examples are your handling of the Zoom security changes, the Box retirement, and the Outlook migration. Status.IU is also fabulous.  I'm not sure if this is related to the purpose of this survey, but I thought I would share anyway: the dedicated IT professionals at the Maurer School of Law are phenomenal. I seriously don't know what we would do without them. I do know that our work and teaching and student satisfaction would suffer without their always-available expertise. I have a colleague in COLL-IT Zone 4 (CITO) who is tremendously frustrated with not having a dedicated IT professional (let alone a whole team of them!) in their building (GISB). So many tech support issues fall on their shoulders because there isn't time to get someone from CITO or it's just too inconvenient to do so. My colleague is not an IT professional and should not be spending their time solving the building's IT issues. They just happen to be both kind and under the age of 40, so everyone asks them for help. I would hate to transfer to a building/department that didn't have dedicated IT professionals.  I work with Exec IT in Bryan Hall. They are consistently terrific--professional, kind, knowledgable, and prompt. I'm grateful for their expertise and willingness to help, always.  Last year, I went to UITS for help configuring my Samsung phone for my IU email. No one seemed to be able to figure out how to do this on my first try. The request was escalated up the chain, still with no resolution. I was finally able to get IU email on my phone. With the recent change-over of course I had to delete and add again.  UITS has always been very helpful anytime I've needed them.  UITS is always quick to respond and resolves my issues.  (1) occasionally I get a call dropped at the 855-6789 helpdesk. It always happens at UITS's end. Are you aware they sometimes just HANG UP ON US? (2) There are just one or two UITS helpdesk staff who could learn to stop talking and listen more, although otherwise they are smart and capable. [IRD] is one. But generally I have found the quality to go UP over the 15 years I've relied on UITS, and I really appreciate how hard they try to find an answer to my question. They sometimes don't have a clue about my IT problem, and I sometimes resolve it myself. But I'd say they get it right 90% of the time, and that's pretty impressive. Thank you for training them so well in customer service.  UITS staff is always helpful and never makes me feel stupid, even though I KNOW I ask questions they must get 5000 times a day.  In my experience, help line staff have been very effective in helping to resolve computer issues. I don't have much success when I have to utilize KB -- I don't find the information complete, user friendly, or helpful and am often frustrated after utilizing KB.  I have interacted with [IRD] regarding telephone services on many instances, and she is professional, and over the top helpful. The ExecIT staff who serve Bryan Hall are always on-the-spot helpful and include compassion for the needs of the user in the way they offer help.  The guys at UITS/CITO are always tremendously helpful and friendly!  None  Na  The centralized availability of downloadable apps is extremely useful. Nevertheless, it would be nice to have some more basic software, for instance Prism, available on this platform.  No concerns or issues.  Staff were highly professional, understanding, and friendly  I have heard from colleagues in multiple units/departments that the migration to exchange online is going horribly across the university, and I'm concerned that we seem to be plowing forward before these issues are addressed.  My interactions have been positive.  No complaints here; always received friendly speedy service.  Not enough collaboration. Year after year I keep hearing things like \" edge leverage and trust,\" and I never see it. it is always \"do it our way or we will use the policy stack and punish you with it.\" Comments on policies are a joke when they are always ignored. Like most large organization UITS is full of itself and believes that theirs is the only perspective that counts. I call bull shit. Furthermore, many of the senior people in UITS are incredibly arrogant.  The UITS has been very helpful this past year when I've contacted them about IT needs, questions and concerns.  They have been most helpful whenever I have needed them!  I have worked on campus from the mid-1990s (!) and have worked in two departments and one research institute. My interactions with UITS was different in the different settings. I also work a lot with GIS technology as well as occasional high performance computing, so have worked with other niches of computing, as well. In academic departments, I feel very alone and find it is difficult to connect resources together for an entire compute-support structure. The turn-over in staff is probably to be expected, but in many cases, bad experiences have been because of the lack of continuity in support. Most IT staff have *not* been around campus since the mid-1990s. My research program relies entirely on my brain and computing resources. When the support is insufficient, my research is insufficient.  Slate storage is EXTREMELY slow. Often times, the cursor freezes when editing a file on the command line using VIM or emacs. Even simple commands such as \"ls\" can hang for 30 seconds. I've taken to working on geode when a project is urgent, which is less than ideal.  It has been hard to schedule time to meet with UITS staff in the distance.  I have not had great experiences with Tier 1 UITS staff in solving various challenges i've had with my computers.  Many of the services outlined in the survey are ones that I have not heard of, including around IU security.  I find the explanations and instructions on the KB system unhelpful.  Our department is served by Exec IT. I have found them extremely helpful and responsive. The times I've had to call during COVID, they have done a great job walking me through things over the pho  Sometimes general UITS notifications don't have enough info. E.g., not sure what I am supposed to do about eduroam or the new notice we got this week.  The staff is always friendly no matter how busy they are and how minor my issue is.  Positives: I am very fortunate to be both supported and led by the expert consultants in Executive IT Support. Every member of the team is professional, they know their users personally, and the level of advice--sometimes 24 hours a day--is exceptional.  Negatives: Box--Google--OneDrive migration. Unfortunately, this was a disaster for me. I now have files in multiple locations that truly should never have been in cloud storage to begin with. The collaborative work functions that existed in earlier iterations of oncourse, etc. are now gone in favor of just cloud storage. But, what hasn't been done is the appropriate education to users on what belongs in cloud storage. So it is not uncommon for me to get 10-15 links every day to documents on one of the cloud storage locations. They are then sitting there, \"clouding\" my ability to get to the materials that I actually need.  I had a great experience with a Box admin who was able to get me access to a Box folder in a timely manner. It was much appreciated help.  I had one occasion where my comments on a Jira ticket were not responded to by the IMS team for several days. There wasn't even an acknowledgement or a \"Hey, we're working on this...\" It was very unnerving.  I have no substantial comments.  I have had excellent service any time I needed assistance  I find that all interactions with UITS employees have been positive.  I am not sure that I ever have interaction with UITS staff. As a member of the VPCPF team we have our own staff (or at least I think the three tech folks are emplyed directly by VPCPF).  Personally I have appreciated working with UITS over the past 11 years that I have worked at IU. I appreciate the staff, and I think with a few changes it could be a better experience. A minor thing that I think could help some staff is the email conversation templates could be easier to read if they had some minor edits (such as text Boxes, indentions to responses, invitations to Zoom someone if the staff member has time to dedicate towards working on the issue at that time remotely, etc.).  Ability for users to access all services remotely that were previously performed at walk-in locations pre-COVID - i.e. resetting duo access, obtaining duo token, etc.  I believe we have exceptionally talented people working at UITS who have a strong desire to provide quality services to the IU community. I especially appreciate the extra work that goes into security protections for the faculty, staff, and student populations. These are important hidden services for many, but the knowledge and efforts that go into keeping IU safe is, I think, very important and worthwhile.  There are many divisions within UITS that provide a lot of services - I've used a variety and I've been continuously impressed over the years with attitudes, competencies, and knowledgeable staff who will, when needed, go the extra mile to help out.  Very much appreciate all the quality efforts. Keep up the great work!  A ticket was closed out once they realized they could not fix the issue, but they did not contact me informing me that this was the case.  I have been very pleased with UITS. I have had no issues with working remotely from home and think UITS has done a fantastic job.  Positive: Our team here at IUSO ([IRD] and [IRD]) are SUPER helpful and always quick to respond and help out; it is so great to have them available remotely as well as on site. I feel that they can resolve issues quickly  Chatting with UITS and getting quick answers is great.  Room for improvement: The informational emails, particularly the ones about important things (like email migration), aren't always as clear as they could be; sometimes I, as a lay person have no idea what they're asking me to do. Maybe have someone not super tech savvy read the emails before you send them out. Also consider more concise and/or fewer emails that are more to-the-point.  With OneDrive, it would be great if there were a way to attach files to email directly from OneDrive. I'm constantly downloading files, then attaching to email.  I have had to rely on UITS several times in the past 11 months to unlock my account. Not quite sure what keeps happening, but they always are helpful and are able to unlock it quickly so I can get back to work. The Outlook migration was a bit rough; it seemed like there were several variations of how it went (in my unit) from (hopefully) migrating automatically, to having to find workarounds because the given instructions were not helpful. It was surprising that something so big and messy had seemingly so little instruction/notice as to something like the Box migration.  The staff I was in contact with were all pleasant and had some tips to help, but eventually the phone call on day 3 was when it was escalated to the Mail Migration Team. Many thanks for doing that, but it took several days of no access during a busy week.  I've been perplexed at the lack of apparent planning with this rollout to Outlook 365: four of my staff have also had problems, and it caused large disruptions on our end. I'm disappointed this rollout wasn't smoother and since we were on day 2, we felt like guinea pigs and were instructed to try things that were not helpful or productive.  Again, not faulting the consultants--but the overall decision to move now and with lack of a clear plan was chaotic.  Thank you.  I have been very impressed by and appreciative of Exec IT during this pandemic year. In my 26 years at IU, I have always been well supported in person and occasionally by phone. This year, their work has been invaluable and beyond impressive.  100% satisfied.  I have had a terrible experience with the migration to Outlook 365; now my email runs slow after a full day of being unable to access it and multiple emails to our help desk. Why is hosting all of IU's emails on Microsoft's cloud a good idea for our university? And right in the middle of the semester? Terrible timing  Love Zoom access, and mitigation sign-up is wonderful.  I use Tier 2 support regularly and find the responses to be helpful and timely to my needs. We also utilize centralized services like JAMF and Config Manager offered and supported by UITS to the whole campus.  Everything has been great throughout the last year! The transition from working in the office to home  was seamless, with some help from prior set-up. Network connectivity through VPN and applications have been consistent. Thanks for all the good work!  I'm newer to IU, so I'm not especially sure what's considered UITS and what is not. Our IT person is generally responsive to my occasional needs.  I feel sometimes there is an assumption of adoption by UITS; for example, I've seen reference to the phishing plug-in for Outlook for a while now, but I don't think I've ever seen information on how to get it--I still just forward suspicious emails to the phishing address I was given when I first started. I have also run into specific network problems on campus that walk-in support suggested some very drastic solutions for (like, reformat my computer--drastic) when the actual problem was that the instability of the wireless network had kicked me off IU's network and locked access to some of my documents.  Overall, though, when I've had issues that could be resolved over email or chat, UITS has been very helpful!  We are an auxiliary so go through tech select for some things and UITS for other things. It's honestly confusing and a bit offputting when you don't know which one to go to to fix a tech issue.  All of my interaction with UITS has been phenomenal!  I wish the VPN were more reliable. Every week I have issues with getting disconnected. Today I got disconnected in the middle of a Zoom meeting. Not good.  Need better options for remoting into work.  Need better options for email. I've had issues with the old and new systems.  i took a class online in the fall semester, and UITS was unable to help me figure out why images weren't downloading on Canvas pages. it wasn't a big deal though and did not impact my ability to complete the course.  I have no experience or suggestions.  My experience with UITS has primarily been very positive. My only complaint, which is out of your control with the IU hiring freeze ,is the delay in responding back. We are all aware you are doing your best; with most of campus working remotely you have a heavy load, but with so many working at home we sometimes need very quick responses.  I do feel that some of the migrations of new programs and procedure are not always ready and have support for the actual begining of the migration to the user. Exchange migrration is an example as I need to consult with my IT to understand the process and get all my devices set. Another example is that the move to the new phones from analog lines. I understand the need; however, I am still struggling with concerns from 2/3 years ago concerning the Recsport mailboxes.  My recommendation for improvement would be to add customer service staff who can assess the user situation, and handle ongoing communications between the user/department and the technician.  I think UITS does a decent job overall, certainly when considering the scope of the operation.  I wish, when using the CAS logger, that I only had to do it one time in a single browser session. I can login into my email and have to login again to Canvas, and a third time to a different application. Its obnoxious.  I wish the Atlassian Bamboo application deployed to the server. Right now with Bamboo, there is only Continuous Integration. It would be awesome to offer both CI/CD. Bamboo is actually a worse product than certain other CI tools. Without Continuous Delivery for Bamboo the only reason I would use it is because its a huge pain in the ass to get the firewall team to change anything.  Speaking of which... have a clear and governed process for firewall exception. It's been completely arbitrary in my experience, and a total pain.  Oh, and WCMS is a complete joke and a total nightmare. Cascade is a bad product, and IU's implementation is maddening  My experience with UITS staff has been great, but I am concerned that the UITS leadership is so chaotic. No one has said so explicitly, but to an outsider it looks like the constant change of leadership and direction is stressful and slowing down production.  I work mostly with the Kelley office of UITS - KSBIT. They are wonderful. Of course, I prefer being able to go to the office in person, but from what I can tell they are just as responsive and helpful remotely. I haven't really used their services a lot lately.  I think my main recommendation would be to clarify the different branches of assistance. I always have to be transferred to a different office for Canvas issues vs. laptop vs. other things. Which is fine, I guess, I just would prefer to know who is the right person to contact.  I have no issues with UITS whatsoever. All positive experiences.  Overall, my interactions with UITS have been positive. However, response times and response levels vary quite a bit amongst different teams within UITS, and the imposition of so many significant migrations (Box, Exchange Online) during what is already a very difficult year for everyone has been challenging for staff and faculty, to say the least.  I have only had positive experiences with UITS staff.  One thing that I would like to see is more connectivity between the various IU websites. It can be confusing when students are trying to order transcripts through the Student Central website or one of the satellite campus websites when there is a centralized one that is arguably more streamlined and specialized for it, for example.  Very friendly and helpful service.  Making the change to Exchange has become very difficult.  When I have put in requests through the online form, the responses have always been prompt in the last year. Usually I will get a phone call the same day I request assistance!  I'm concerned that occasionally I have a non-UITS issue but the technicians do not know where I SHOULD go to get my problem addressed. It would be good for the service staff to know more about the entire IU system so they know who we should contact for more specific/system specific issues.  I know that there are many factors in deciding which tools and applications to support, but I would like UITS and the IU administration to give more weight to the potential productivity costs of discontinuing services like Box or imposing additional security requirements on email and other services before implementing them. The additional stress of these transitions is particularly unwelcome in the midst of the current pandemic.  I know that the pace of change in IT is swift and often unbroken. However, from a user standpoint, there is a real value to stability and the comfort with systems that comes from familiarity. Each change of systems, platforms, apps, etc. comes at a cost to productivity, at least in the short term.  Staff is very competent - my IT problems are always solved in a timely manner.  Haven't had much need for UITS services, but when i do they seem to be very knowledgeable.  Sometimes the \"help\" has acronyms that I do not know the meaning of. I can not think of one just now. Whenever I have contacted UITS and get a live person, they have been very helpful.  Even the questions--sometimes I am not sure of exactly what you are asking: platforms, system name,  \"web content management\" not sure if that is who I contact about a website. I do not think I would be a good candidate for a focus group due to overall lack of knowledge. I am one those that can read something in KB and still not know what to do.  None  I have had great customer service from UTIS whenever we have had issues in Center with printers or computers!  No concerns or issues  None at this time.  Whenever I submit an IT ticket, it either takes several days for someone to get back to me, or else no one ever does. However, the help I have received has been excellent.  Also, several of my colleagues and I are still experiencing fallout from the email migration that is making work difficult.  I work 100% remotely. I have trouble with Zoom when using VPN. Unfortunately my support requires connection to VPN. I haven't figured out if it's my internet connection (xfinity 200MB) or the VPN, but it's frustrating for me and my clients.  I'm interested to find out how UITS (and the rest of us) can provide better support experiences through Service Now than we are able to provide with Footprints. I have no specific concerns about my own support experiences.  No negative interactions, I've always been impressed with UITS over my years at IU. And I appreciate in non-COVID times being able to pop into the IMU or Wells to consult face-to-face. That can be very  helpful when on campus.  I'd like to suggest a better way, visually, to access information. There's so much great information, but it's a sea of words and links.  Given the pandemic, I believe UITS & OVPUE IT have done a terrific job!  Simplify the KB. Really narrow topic and give proper procedure for it in simple form  Since several of us have been working remotely most of the time for nearly a year, I have to say that I find support to be lacking.  Laptop updates are questionable as to whether they happen or are correct. If a computer has to be rebuilt - there usually isn't a back up available.  Real time support is often understaffed and slow. Many of us are on call 24/7. I think tech support should be as well.  I generally have positive experiences with UITS staff -- I appreciate their friendliness.  Thorough information is available online but sometimes difficult to find and follow.  It would have been better to not give two cloud storage solutions when Box was phased out. Some depts are on Google Drive and some are on OneDrive (or Teams).  It's been very confusing and would have been so much better if only one was chosen for those of us who rely on the cloud so much for storing and sharing files.  Our department works with Tech Select, and the team provides friendly, professional service. However, the use of Bomgar to work through issues is challenging. It would be nice if they would also initiate a phone call or Zoom so they could provide specific instructions.  The staff I have had the pleasure of working with have been exceptional. Always nice, positive, and honest.  I have been very satisfied with the services provided. Anytime I have had minor issues, UITS staff has always been very helpful and extremely pleasant.  UITS staff have been pretty good in the past year with likely more demand for services.  Never have issues with them. Very responsive.  The UITS service is good.  I have found the service at UITS to be exceptional--folks are responsive and willing to work through difficulties.  One thing I have found frustrating is that the move from Box went to two options -- that roll out made it difficult for cross team work because you have to deal with some using Google and some using OneDrive. It made for a much larger learning curve and files all over the place.  Is it possible for Outlook to work seamless and faster? Currently it has been slowing down a lot. Appears like it goes into thinking mode a lot, regardless of working on desktop on campus or remotely working from home using VPN.  UITS staff have always been helpful to me, when I needed their assistance.  The move away from Box has created a lot of extra work and wasted time interacting with our cloud stored files. There are many key components of Box in regards to daily workflow management and editing of files that did not translate in the new Microsoft Sharepoint system. We explored both Microsoft and Google Drive as work environments, and Microsoft seemed to be the better fit. But every day that passes makes me miss Box. The two biggest points of need are a replacement for BoxEdit specifically for editing and saving Adobe files, along with a robust search engine that allows you to search the entire directory of files regardless of where or what you are currently viewing.  I have always had good experiences with UITS. Very prompt service.  I didn't realize how much of my work is connected to CITO. I should be more proactive in utilizing the resources and learning tools. I appreciate the KB articles, which exist for pretty much any topic one could think of. They're not always as clear to me, but again I could probably be more proactive in seeking to understand.  One of my concerns is the length of time it takes to get a response (sometimes the need is immediate in our corner of the IU world). Plus, I am not sure UITS has a specific capture of how our department works with a daily deadline-driven workload (not faculty based, but research-driven). I normally do not have time to do the tech work myself (when I receive directions to fix it myself), but still need it fixed quickly, so that can be a bit frustrating. In other words, I miss the days when we had our own tech help, who knew what we did, how our assignments are managed, and could administer help without asking WHY do you need that? ! I am sure UITS is much busier with covering a higher percentage of IU, so it is difficult when we used to have our own group who could focus on just our work.  Positive:  [IRD] has been an incredible resource for me on solving issues when I was able to work with him.  Negative:  Tickets usually take a very long time (up to 2 weeks) to get a response.  I have experienced very timely and helpful responses when reaching out via email and phone.  The UITS employees that I've worked with have been responsive and have worked quickly. They also provide a lot of insight when I have questions. I don't think I've had a bad interaction with a UITS Staff member.  Information about storage limits or account figures on HPC is sometimes hard to find or confusing.  With regard to the recent email migration, I'm not as confident about moving to a cloud-based system. While I have reservations about anything that is cloud-based, I will defer to you, the experts, to make sure that this will work. I'm not necessarily \"anti-cloud\" as the cloud has been a lifesaver in some situations. But, I am skeptical of a project of this magnitude being cloud-based.  Over the last year, UITS has shown to the University a steadfast and calm response to rapid change. Perhaps this is what they have been preparing for all of these years. Migrations to new systems on UITS's part have been nearly seamless. Their responses to end-users have been helpful and have resulted in more and more user-friendly experiences for staff and students.  Their work throughout this Pandemic has raised the level of service to the community of Indiana University to great heights.  [IRD] and [IRD] have been excellent collaborators!  Recommendation: For WCMS Priority Support contracts, allow unused support hours to roll over month to month.   ### Undergraduate responses:  No  They helped me connect my computer to a better WIFI, so I have no complaints.Very good about being quick to answer phone calls to the help line.  I have issues with the printers regularly, where I upload documents to the mobile printing site, and thenthey don’t show up at any of the printers when I swipe my crimson card. I have used the computer labat the IMU before and asked for help from the UITS person there, and he was no help whatsoever.  I called UITS once because I couldn't log into Canvas, and they fixed the issue in a timely manner.  The UITS staff was very helpful and welcoming when I had questions about accessing my IU account.  Not really anything negative. When I emailed a couple times the person responding did not read the full email. That being said the person tried to advise me on how to fix the issue, when I already tried that certain procedure, which was stated in the email.  Just wanted to say thanks for all your hard work! I'm sure it hasn't been easy this past year.  Most of the time the solstice systems do not work. UITS online is very helpful, and the people are always helpful.  UITS support has been very helpful when there is a problem  Since everything is on Zoom right now, it’s frustrating when campus WIFI isn’t 100% .  I haven't had many encounters with UTIS. The one I did have pertaining to a technical issue was resolved extremely fast and concisely. Overall, my perception of UTIS is positive.  One of the biggest changes that I would like to see is in regards to IUAnyWare. I think that overall it is great, but it's really frustrating that if one disconnects from a computer, they are not able to log back into the same computer. I have lost 2 important files that way, and I think it would be really beneficial to have a designated desktop for each IU student if possible.  UITS has always been super friendly and helpful with me! I have no issues  I have not interacted with any UITS Staff to my knowledge. I did have trouble connecting all of my devices to the Campus WIFI when I first moved in; however, I have had no issues since.  The UITS staff has always been available to help me with technological issues. A positive experience I had was going to the technical help center at Wells Library and sorting out a WIFI issue on my computer with a UITS representative.  This semester I have had trouble with my iPhone, and because of this issue I had trouble getting into any of my IU accounts because my DUO mobile app is connected to my phone. I went to UITS staff services in Wells Library and was able to get a DUO coin. Without the help of a staff member I would have missed assignment dues dates and virtual learning lectures. I have had no negative interactions with UITS. I recommend that you send out DUO coins or make it a more known option instead of the DUO mobile app!  I personally have not had any interaction with UITS and the staff or services, but I know it’s available to me if I need it.  I have asked them to help me Bootcamp my MacBook Pro; they were very nice and helpful. I have not had any negative experiences.  Igps, class search engine, shopping cart - all feel outdated and unwieldy. Have always disliked using them to a point of scheduling in person. Being able to filter classes by degree requirements with, say, a tag system would be amazing.  None off of the top of my head.  All good!  The UITS team in Wells Library was always willing to help me whenever I had an issue with my computer even if it was super late; they were always super helpful and nice about helping me.  I haven't had many interactions with UITS, but they've all been helpful.  I have had only pretty good experiences with UITS staff or services.  Every issue that I've had has been small, and the people I contacted with questions were able to solve them super quickly. The UITS website can be confusing sometimes, but you can always contact staff and they can help.  Why can't we get campus WIFI at the edge of campus? I live in the Evermann/Redbud area, and it's kind of annoying that I have to set up my own router. It creates a lot of competition and slows down everyone's WIFI since each apartment has their own. I had better WIFI when I lived in the dorms.  Make the Duo login verification process easier (ex: allow the site to \"remember me for 7 days\" on the Safari browser.)  The printing is difficult to navigate.  Everyone who helps me at the library.  Love the free trainings online!  The UITS staff is very helpful when any issues arise, and I love the ability to chat with them through my laptop to solve issues.  No comment  Zoom isn't working so many times it's ridiculous. Laundry alerts are not exactly the correct time (the machines stopped, I didn't see that on the app, and someone moved my clothes). iGPS doesn't have enough filters. Student Center logs me out after two minutes.  Overall nothing but great experiences with UITS.  I briefly worked for UITS during my time as an undergrad as a part of Campus Outreach and really enjoyed my tenure there.  All of my experiences with UITS have been great. Especially in the virtual environment inflicted by COVID-19.  Any time I have ever had a tech problem, UITS has solved it right away!  Minor issues with Zoom , such as not being able to authenticate at times, etc. Most of these have been fixed, but some remain.  n/a  No  I currently have not had a negative experience with UITS staff or services because no issues have appeared that would cause me to use them.  n/a  I have not had contact with UITS yet, but I do suggest making them easier to access; making the information more readily available would be very beneficial.  n/a  None  Zoom meeting issues.  Canvas is awesome! Love how everything is in the same place!  I had a negative experience with the UITS staff and services. I was trying to fix my TV and was treated rather rudely from the staff.  UITS staff has always been helpful and prompt in assisting me. I have no concerns or negative interactions with UITS. I also have no recommendations for new services.  I contacted UITS once when I needed help with Canvas, and they helped perfectly!  When I was still on campus, the WIFI sometimes worked and sometimes didn’t.  I hate duo.  I would recommend making an app with tech tips and then notifications can be sent to people’s phones when a certain program or website is down  I have had issues with my laptop throughout the year, and UITS staff was really helpful.  Um when I call that tech support phone number at like 4:30 am asking some stupid question, some nice person always answers like right away and is really patiently like, \"did you try unplugging it and plugging it back in\" and I'm like, \"ohh yeah its fixed,\" and its like the only iu phone number that actually works.  Whenever I face problem with my Canvas and I email the IT supports, they always reply fast and help me solve the problem.  So far I have had no negative interactions with UITS  Nah, service has been pretty good if I have received any; can't say for sure if I have or have not.  I have a current issue with one or two of my classes regarding being able to access their Zoom class for the lectures. For some reason when I try to join these two classes, I get a message from Zoom saying it is restricted access and to sign in, but once I try to sign in it says you cannot log in to Zoom this way.  My experiences with UITS in he past have been good. I typically do not require technology help, but I have felt comfortable calling or emailing UITS and received assistance.  They helped me set up Office on my Mac which was nice.  This was not me personally, but I was with a friend of mine when she went to talk to UITS about getting a WIFI hotspot for a location without internet as we were leaving campus last spring for COVID. She didn't end up needing it, but they were super helpful, and I wanted to commend that.  Some services like iGPS and student center can be slightly confusing. For example, the my degree progress tab on iGPS only shows up from a certain page and not another.  The UITS staff was really helpful when I had troubles downloading Microsoft software.  I feel as though everyone was very friendly and nice. I never experienced any negative interactions with a staff member. They never had an issue when I had a question or concern. Nor have I ever used the services.  Slow internet in on-campus apartments.  Always willing to help and easy to contact. Crashing of Zoom/Canvas occurs sometimes, specifically Kaltura.  N/a  I think that if we can have the option to log in without a limited date. I wanted it to be an unlimited date so that I don't have to do the login process over and over and over and over again. I find it quite annoying to do it over and over again. I don't mind if it logs itself out, but I can favor the two-step login if there is the unlimited date option.  When I had trouble logging in, I called UITS and talked to the staff. He was helpful and instructive.  I haven't personally had any notable positive or negative experience with UITS. I think the website is nice, easy to navigate. I do think that UITS is underrepresented. My profs might occasionally mention that UITS exists, and they'll put the link in their syllabus, but I feel like I tend to forget about the resources UITS provides.  At the beginning of the semester, I only had the ability to download half of the Adobe apps available to me in my IU subscription. I had to call UITS four times to resolve the issue. Each call took approximately an hour. On the fourth call, the staff member had me enable a remote desktop and found that the issue had to be resolved with a request from UITS to Adobe. While I was frustrated to have to speak with four different staff members before resolving the issue, all were polite and gave new suggestions to resolve the issue.  I have not had any experiences with UITS.  I haven’t interacted with UITS but classmates have said that they are really helpful.  I don't necessarily have any negative interactions. In terms of improvement, I really enjoy the IU knowledge base, but it would be nice to have a live chat you can go to online (if there is already one, I apologize but perhaps better advertising of services might be more effective). I also think that clarifications about IU printing would be more helpful. I realize it's listed on the printer, but I've heard students mention that we are allocated a certain number of prints before we pay for them, which I'm not sure is true or not, but I think having an informative guide to printing and promote that to students would be nice. I also think better maintenance of printers in all buildings would be useful, or having an app where we can find printers closest to us in buildings we may not be familiar with would be helpful as well (or also knowing which ones are out of service).  I have had no issues with any of my experiences with UITS to assist in any technological issues.  During my first semester at Indiana University Bloomington, I have had very good experiences with reliable service as well as WIFI. I know things have heavily relied on network, and I have almost never had trouble completing my assignments because of any tech issues. I will be bringing a tv this semester and am interested to see how the WIFI will play out with that.  With this year I haven’t used a lot of those campus centered features.  Wireless internet in the Music Annex can be pretty spotty at times. I don't like the printer UI and wish that it were more user-friendly and had better access to different settings (for instance, ease of selecting color/BW printing or which edge to flip double-sided pages). I also frequently have failed prints using mobile print on my laptop PC.  The only interaction I had with UITS has been when my roommate was trying to connect her Xbox to IU WIFI. It took almost an hour.  I enjoy being able go use computer lab desktops with IUAnywhere from my computer at home so I use programs like Microsoft office and adobe cc that would otherwise be very expensive.  I have had a few times in which Canvas was messed up and UITS has been able to help, but other than that, I have very little experience with them.  I've had nothing but great experiences, and I don't know what else could improve.  Maybe somehow add our academic advisement information on what courses/ requirements we need still to igps. That would be very helpful when searching/planning for classes.  N/A  Last semester I had to do a project on an Ubuntu machine, and my laptop didn't have enough storage to run the project on a VM. UITS helped me get set up in Luddy with all the software I needed. It was a lengthy process since I couldn't download software myself for the project, I had to keep asking for more stuff. The people at UITS I worked with were great and answered all my questions.  I haven't had to use UITS a lot in my time at IU but the experiences I have had have been positive.  UITS helped me troubleshoot setting up my gaming system my freshman year in my dorm, helped me figure out IU anywhere for certain apps on my Mac, and they set me up with a token for duo.  It would be cool if UITS could promote tech/apps they think are necessary to have in college or that would make things easier. I'd also love it if there were easy options for students to learn things like excel or coding that UITS could promote or encourage students to complete. Above is what I wrote before taking the survey. After taking the survey I see that UITS does offer some of those services I was talking about; I just wish they were a little more advertised.  I have not had many encounters with the UITS staff recently, but I recall freshman year they were extremely accommodating and helpful in solving my computer problems  The print@iu.edu doesn't work anymore.  After the survey, I realize that I've never seen or heard of half of the services that UITS has to offer.  I don't have any concerns about UITS, and I have no negative comments. I also have not had much interaction, so I do not have any recommendations.  I came to a UITS employee with a problem on my laptop, and they not only solved that one, but two other problems I didn't even realize I had. So nice to go above and beyond.  They were helpful!  UITS have done a wonderful job with making sure my technology needs are taken care of when they respond to me. Sometimes its difficult to connect to UITS and make sure I have them timely interact with me. I do not want to undermine their importance and how great of a job they do, but if I am struggling with a IU program or technology the response time needs to be sooner.  None as of now.  I have had nothing but positive experiences in the past.  I have not had any experience with UITS staff.  I had two positive experiences with UITS in my time at IU. They helped me set up my smart tv at my dorm on the campus WIFI and helped me figure out my Zoom account log in for IU Zooms when classes moved online!  I would say the tech end of things is great right now.  I have had issues figuring out WCMS, and have often wished that it would be easier to hand over website privileges to a UITS assistant and have them assist with technical issues directly.  Announcements concerning Zoom sign in and/or sign up should have been more specific. Beginning this semester, I was locked out of my account because I wasn't aware that as part of the new security, I couldn't just sign in to my Zoom account. I had to go to another option and select my school before signing in. (Note: I know this is different because it wasn't the same last semester.) When I contacted the support staff at IU, the person I talked to was able to look and see what the problem was but didn't have the authority to fix it. They then proceeded to try and get ahold of three different advisors to unlock my account, of which no one answered. This caused me to miss all but 10 minutes of my first class. I was also told by the person I contacted that they were getting a lot of calls about this issue.  - Common layout for all the One.IU (Student Center, iGPS, etc.) applications.  They have helped me with Canvas and the campus WIFI and both were great experiences.  My favorite part about UITS is the fact that they have the station at the library to help.  They are super helpful with any problems I've ever encountered.  I have had mostly good experiences with UITS staff and services. The duo mobile does get annoying though. And I am not sure if laundry machines are included in this topic, but half of them do not work properly. I also think that there should be more covid testing locations so I don't have to walk 20+ minutes. Besides that though, I think UITS has done a great job.  I only have positive things to say about UITS staff and services. I've been to the UITS office many times at Wells Library and the IMU about tech issues, and the staff always solves them quickly. I can tell they're very knowledgeable and provide important information related to my tech issues. For new or improved services, I would maybe advertise to all IU students about office hours where they can dropin or schedule a virtual appointment. I'm not sure if you all have virtual office hours since I've never been myself, but I think that would be super helpful for all students.  UITS has never given me any negative experiences, and I believe that is very beneficial for all students and facility on this campus.  N/A  I've had to get in contact with IT a couple times, and it usually doesn't take too long, and the service is good.  I've always had good experience with the staff. My biggest beef with UITS is when the printing service goes down and I can't print out the assignments I need for class. Or when I try to print things, and they never come out of the printer. And the wifi in my Union Street apartment doesn't extend through my whole bedroom, so I have to use cellular data to go on my phone in parts of my room.  Every time I have encountered UITS they have been kind and helpful. They go out of their way to make sure that all of my concerns are dealt with and make me feel comfortable to ask additional questions.  I've only had positive experiences with UITS. I had issues freshman year with my laptop, and UITS was very responsive. They helped me navigate next steps when they couldn't solve it but also one time fixed a problem in like 5 seconds (it was wonderful). Last year I had issues signing into my accounts when my phone broke (duo), and they were totally prepared and helpful with that as well. They're good!  I had an issue with a program I was using last semester, and UITS spent roughly 3 days fixing it and gave me a report that I could give to my professor since I could not do an assignment until it was fixed.  They were very helpful!  My interaction with staff have all been good. They help my problems in a concise manner.  I have had good experiences. With COVID, technology has been tricky, and they have always been helpful.  I have no feedback! Everyone is helpful and excellent during these difficult times.  A great service to help IU students use the technological services at IU.  I had difficulty with one quiz; it only let me take it once.  This is my first semester at IU, so all good so far!  I have had a great experience with the UITS staff. They are very helpful when I come to them with problems.  I have had neutral experience. Some bad/frustrating, some easy.  The UITS Staff has always been very helpful when I have contacted them. No complaints.  no concern  I have never had a bad experience with a staff member. I used to work in the dorms, however, and it seemed like the printers were always in disarray and never worked properly.  No concerns  No recommendations  Every time I call UITS my problem is solved very quickly  Friendly and helpful staff and some easy to use programs.  Once I had a problem with my laptop in the Well's Library, and I went to UITS for help, and they couldn't figure it out. They were nice, but students, so not really experienced enough to know what was going on.  They are very helpful at syncing my laptop to the printers.  The bursar/ paying your bills needs to be done with purely IU, not a third party company. It looks sketchy and has a high service fee to pay bills to IU-- about 10% when using credit card. Also, it is hard to navigate, and there was a class action lawsuit against the current third party company.  I don't like how I am not allowed to access my course work until I schedule a covid test every week. I don't believe that should be linked. I also am concerned about accessing my course work without my phone, since there is Duo Mobile.  All my experiences with UITS have been great. At the beginning of the semester I had to call to get wifi on my gaming device, and the gentleman on the phone was very helpful and even sent me an email to help even more if I ran into any further problems. This was a great experience overall. I think UITS is a great service so should continue as is.  N/A  None  I found UITS helpful. I have not really needed their help in a while. Someone from UITS helped me with bootcamp on my Mac.  I've only had one or two experiences with UITS, but they have all been positive.  I am fully happy with the services and UITS staff. I don't have any negative feedback.  N/A  They are helpful at Wells.  None  When I had problems with Canvas and WIFI, UITS was very helpful to guide me through everything.  Units has always been very helpful. Being an informatics major, UITS has been a part of my experience at IU, and they are always nice and helpful.  Great always  I lived in Campus View, the internet in the evening is sometimes slow and not connectable.  All the times I’ve called UITS they’ve tried to help as much as possible and fix all the problems I have.  They’re fast in solving my problems.  So far the Zoom services have worked for me.  I have only had one experience using UITS support, and it was a very pleasurable experience, and they were able to help solve my problem quickly and effectively. All other services that UITS provide are helpful and work efficiently.  N/A  UITS staff is very helpful.  I haven’t had any interactions with UITS staff .  It's great.  I would say that I haven’t had very many negative experiences with staff, and I believe they do their best to deal with and address problems very efficiently  N/A  they are always willing to help and walk me through things that i am confused on  UITS staff has helped me solve SPSS issues for my M-346 course.  Any time Zoom or Kaltura has had an issue (either with being down or with an abundance of people trying to access them such as at the beginning of the pandemic), UITS was always very supportive and helpful, not to mention responsive and fast-acting. Whenever teachers receive emails for tech failures, the problems are nearly always remedied before I even have to deal with it.  On campus wifi can be spotty, and it is inconvenient that the wifi does not extend to outside of many buildings when current indoor areas to study are limited or nonexistent.  I have not thought about it;I have not had to utilize this resource very much. But it is nice to know that it is available for support for tech issues.  I don't have many experiences with UITS. I mostly haven't had technical issues so far. There was the first week of fall 2020 where like everything crashed, and it was nice to have the crash reports show up in UITS so I could know it wasn't just me.  None  UITS helped me transition my computer software to be able to do my job from home during the pandemic. I did not get put on hold for a long time or have issues understanding what the problem was.  I appreciated the help immensely.  They always reply quickly and help with whatever issues I have.  When I had an issue with my computer this semester I did a live call where they actually fixed the problem remotely very quickly and efficiently. It was a good experience. I am confused if we are able to walk in in-person for appointments at IT support at the libraries, however, and don't feel that that information is easy to attain.  Applied for exemption for Mitigation testing, due to the fact I had tested positive for COVID January 4th, and I still get text messages/ notifications every week about signing up for mitigation testing.  DUO Mobile also gets excessive when I have to login to every account with it every time. Takes a lot of time.  I appreciate the access granted and the availability of the services!  I liked the old way we registered for classes better. The new updated version we used for spring 2021 was very confusing  I had a positive experience when my emails were not forwarding correctly and staff helped me resolve this!  Sometimes I'd wish there was a software available that I wanted like Parallels, and I wish there could be like a texting or quick chat with help that is actually fast.  Canvas needs to stop being down randomly.  I have only had positive experiences with UITS. Once I was having trouble with Canvas and was quickly pointed to the right solution.  Very helpful with move-in and connection to wifi for computer and console. The wifi is a bit lagged at times and it is hard to complete work at the speed I need to.  N/A  Very helpful.  If it were easier to access the services it would be very nice.  I had a great experience working with UITS when I needed a hot spot at home during this pandemic. It was great to have people who were understanding and considerate of my needs during this crazy time.  I would recommend sending monthly e-mails about helpful tips and such because I am often bombarded with too many e-mails from the university.  Many thanks!  I have no negative interactions or concerns.  I have not had any negative experiences, and every time I have needed help (not often), I have received the necessary assistance.  n/a  I had many frustrating issues with my computer first semester, so I called UITS support several times for help. Every time, the staff member on the line was friendly and patient. When it turned out I needed a new ethernet cable installed in my dorm room, the communication was clear, and the staff installing the new Box were so friendly and swift.  I personally have contacted UITS when it came to Zoom issues, and they were able to help me get access. Something I think might be helpful is potentially sending out instructions on how to access iu  Zoom on the phone. I know a lot of people have issues with this.  I had a good experience with UITS last year. I was having trouble with my computer dropping the installment of wifi all together. I was in a frustrated state, and the person who answered my call was great. He listened and explored different avenues of what could work. We found an option that worked for the time being! I eventually got a new computer. I benefit from many of the services provided. I use Office365 and OneDrive.  N/A  I think everything has gone very well for me personally and don’t have any complaints or suggestions.  It would be better if the school wifi could be more stable and fast in the future, even though I may not have had chances to test that recently.  I thought for the most part Canvas worked well. I wish that when Professors posted lectures that it would save my progress watching if I had to go do something else.  I had a good experience with UITS when I when I got a new phone and needed help getting the WI-FI to work on it.  I wish the hiring process was more specific in terms of timing/expected response time for a position on  IU HRMS.  UITS helped me when I had a question about IUanyWare, and they were very helpful and willing to answer any questions that I had.  No bad reviews or experiences very neutral.  i've never needed to use UITS staff, but i have had to use iuware through UITS  Overall, UITS staff have been great.  I have never had any problems with the computers in the libraries or in Wright. I have not had any problems with the staff. When I needed help when the printer didn't seem to be working, the staff was friendly and willing to help.  I have had consistently wonderful service from UITS over many years. It is a privilege to work at a university with such an excellent IT organization, a true leader among national and international peers.  All experiences have been positive except the wifi.  The only experiences I've had directly with UITS service and/or staff have been very polite and helpful.  I can't recall any unpleasant experience.  That being said, the way to set up emails within the IU accounts aren't very user friendly. And when using that same account in different areas, (student info/parking passes/etc.) it's apparent that not every department uses the same records system, and it becomes kind of a hassle to try to do things within my account.  I have had help from UTIS, and I enjoyed the experience. I remember that the person I worked with was very kind and helped me figure out my issue with my laptop quickly.  I have visited the UITS staff with some questions, and I was greeted pretty rudely at the door, and I never got to enter the building and was asked what I needed from the outside. When my question could not be answered, I was turned away.  When I’ve needed to register new devices or reset my wifi, UITS is generally knowledgeable and helpful.  I was very unimpressed with UITS recently. After moving the location of my meeting at the last minute, my router was supposedly set up but wouldn't work when I returned to my building. I then had to call where I was given another appointment that wasn't until the next day. I was told there were no appointments the rest of the night and that there was nothing that could be done. However, I was able to find [IRD] at the Evermann building who was able to solve my problem within 2 minutes.  During my sophomore year, I lived at BBHN apartments and someone came down and set up my wifi. She was nice, and it was done pretty quick.  I recently reached out to UITS about an issue with IUanyWare and they helped me a lot.  Na  no  Great customer service.  One of the biggest concerns I have about this semester is about virtual learning in general. I feel that it is not as effective as in-person learning, and thus the class should adjust to this.  I have always had great experiences with UITS. They have been helpful in helping me get my laptop set up to the printer system at IU and answering questions and helping me get my Zoom fixed.  I've had minimal experience with UITS but when I have, it's been postive. I have had issues with IUWare in the past and questions that had to do with downloading software that were fixed almost immediately and entirely over the phone. Makes my life much better...so thanks, UITS.  I feel as if most things are running smoothly. At times the WiFi will disconnect from mostly my iPhone and it can become aggravating, but that is my only complaint.  My experiences have been great all-around. Would like to get fewer UITS emails. But would like clarity on where to go if I have issues.  I think online class is bad.  NA  I have not had any issues with UITS but appreciate it being an accessible service to IU.  I have not had many interactions with UITS, but using simplified terms may help some students better understand how to fix their tech issues.  Especially with covid, people like to sit outside and do homework on campus, but it is hard to find a place outside an academic building where the WiFi is strong enough, so that could be a nice change if posible.  No bad experiences  I have also had good experiences with UITS when I need them!  One time I had to print out an essay and a printer wasn't not working. They helped me realize that I needed to refill the paper or switch the tray.  I have not had any tech issues and have not needed to contact UITS.  One of my biggest pet peeves when using IU systems, specifically one.iu.edu is that it forces you to relogin with every single thing you press. It would make more sense to have one login instead of logging in on every single page. I know other students who have the same complaint as well.  I have only ever had positive experiences with UITS  I've used UITS chat and virtual services in the past and have had positive, helpful experiences. I like that IT service members can control your screen virtually to aid in solving an issue.  I had a good experience with UITS. They came to set up my router and were on time, wore a mask, and answered all of my questions.  I have not had any direct interactions with UITS.  I have had positive experiences with UITS. I wish that the IUAnyware desktops would always load the same apps. If that could be fixed, I would greatly appreciate it.  From the experiences I have had for myself and my friends, our problems got solved easily and quickly.  I havent used it this year TBH, but last year it was helpful and had a positve experience.  So far I've had positive interactions; if I needed help or had a question I received answers/help.  For the most part, the UITS knowledge base is a great place to find answers; however, some of the information is very hard to follow. It seems that UITS members are hard to reach and often don't even respond. I think that many of the interfaces could be adapted to better suit the campus.  I have always had positive interactions.  If anything, I wish my classes would stop using so many different apps and services. I wish there were one single place that all my classes used, but I know that isn’t UITS’s fault.  I have not had any interaction with the UITS staff, but I know many people who have, and they had great experiences.  No  Although UITS has been helpful in certain instances, I find that they are incredibly hard to reach. I'm usually on hold for a minimum of 10 minutes, usually much longer, before I can speak to someone.  I only used UITS once, but the person I was matched with was extremely kind and helpful and took their time to help me solve my technological issues.  Help setting up my devices and IU gmail!  No  Instant messaging  I’ve never had a negative experience!  I would suggest improving the wifi login process. When I first came to campus, it was really challenging and confusing trying to sign into the wifi, and I had to use the IU Guest wifi for several days.  One time I went to Wells Library, and they helped with my computer. It was good.  N/A  All of my experiences have been positive  I haven't experienced anything.  I have had only positive experiences with UITS. Especially transitioning online! Regardless, I've always received prompt efficient help!  I personally have not had to work with UITS staff, as I have not had many issues with technology, but the bright side of that is that I have not had issues with technology! It seems that the staff is well coordinated to make sure that problems are taken care of.  None  UITS has alwasy been a pleasure to work with. Whenever I have an issue, they fix it right away!  Nothing has been off putting or strange with my experiences using UITS services!  Patient staff and solve my problem.  Various times for me to choose.  I’m not sure if this is a service already but possibly having a service where students can get their computers cleaned and serviced to run faster.  No  I have not had many experiences with tech members themselves, but the ones I have had have been great! The technology offered by IU is excellent. Kaltura sometimes won't play videos, but overall it usually works!  Not bad at all.  They were helpful when I lost my phone at getting me a token so I could log into Duo!  I have used UITS services at the libraries on campus and some of the IUB buildings. The interface is clean and quick to use. The WIFI availability is exceptional.  Always extremely helpful and are always able to quickly fix all of my problems  So far, I've had a positive experience with the UITS staff, but i do have a few concerns. I was on the phone for many minutes with one of the staff about an issue I had with my TV in my dorm. He wasn't able to help me in the end but right after I got off the phone, I Googled my issue and fixed it myself.  Also the wait is another issue.  The only issue I’ve found with IU technology is the difficulty finding and registering for classes.  I think the website needs to be updated because with most of the iu websites I find it hard to navigate and frustrating. I think also getting more databases that are easier to use on iOS because it can be very limiting for students who can’t afford computers and don’t want to have to go to a computer lab everyday.  I have had nothing but great experiences with UITS and its staff. I have had multiple problems with office 365 as well as IU anyware. They were there to help and made it seem so simple on what to do.  I had a misaligned Canvas page. UITS was able to help, and their predicted response time was accurate!  No concerns  Canvas no longer works (pictures won't load; 3rd party extensions don't work; general buggy laggy mess) on Safari & Firefox, no matter what changes are made, yet they're the browsers with the highest security ratings. I just *LOVE* compromising my privacy by using Chrome. There are no options in the other browsers to address security concerns for a single site without doing so systemwide, so it's a nogo for me. Chrome is not my go-to browser; I use it by necessity since it's the ONLY one that consistently works.  I have never knowingly had an interaction with UITS staff or services.  So far I have not encountered any negative interactions. I had positive experiences with logging in to my IU email account and using other computers to log in.  UITS live chat and KB has always been helpful in fixing any problems that I run into. Computing services are helpful and used regularly. Some of the older UIs could use an update.  They work great; I’ve never had issues!  Connecting non-browser devices to the wifi is a pain, and I’ve had horrible success accomplishing this on my own, without the supports of UITS.  N/A  Unfortunately, the UITS staff have not been helpful with Zoom this year, and I think that could be improved. Apps on IUanyware crash a LOT. The wifi on campus is at like 2/10 as far as functionality honestly, and the new Canvas update is nice looking but a little less intuitive if you need to submit a text Box AND a file.  Helpful everytime I needed something.  Wifi can still be a little tricky sometimes, but I think it has gotten much better throughout the year.  I had a virus on my computer and was able to get help with the current virus and how to avoid them in the future.  I have had no problems with UITS.  I was unaware that we can have a free prescription to The Wall Street Journal. Can UITS do more to promote/communicate all the resources the school provides and maybe have a catalog of all the services in one place?  My only issue was when the Canvas servers were overwhelmed one day and it shut me out in the middle of a quiz.  They are usually available and helpful in the couple times that I've used them.  I am living off-campus this semester so I have not had much contact with UITS personally, but I do know they are readily available, as my professors often let us know that during quizzes or tests, any issues we have will be handled by UITS.  UITS is so speedy, friendly, and kind. I love working with them, and they never make me feel like I'm doing something incorrectly. Thank you for all of your efforts!  UITS has helped me a lot in the past with IU Anyware issues that I've had. I think I've had difficulty with UITS when it was through chat since sometimes the staff didn't completely understand what issues I was having.  I don't have any outstanding initial thoughts.  Wifi is slow.  I have had very positive experiences with UITS and the staff when I have had issues with technology at IU. I do recommend that there be an easy way to find what all technological resources and programs are available for free to IU students, because I would like to explore some of those options but do not know where to start looking.  n/a  The WiFi gets very spotty very often.  I haven't had any major problems with UITS. The staff is always nice and willing to help with any problems they may assistant you in.  Up to this point, all of my interactions with UITS have been minor and went exceptionally well! The register for classes page where all our schedules and information is held looks like it's from 2004 and needs to be updated and modernized.  I do not have any concerns. Everything has been smooth so far  No  I have had very little interaction with UITS, but when I did it was very helpful.  UITS is very patient, but I do not use them that often.  n/a  I haven't yet had a sufficient experiences with UITS to have a negative or positive image.  I have to say school, on campus housing wifis are .. terrible. Not trying to say it in an offensive way but I am experiencing extreme difficulties within my courseworks because of how unstable my wifis are.  Overall, I have had positive experiences with the UITS staff and the services that they provide.  UITS is great because they are always available and someone can help you no matter when you need it.  I am new to UITS,so I do not have any advice or concerns yet.  The UITS staff are always helpful either before the pandemic or during the pandemic. Whether its inperson or virtual, the staff are capable and knowledgeable enough to help me with tech issues such as Zoom, problems in logging in, a computer virus, etc.  I have had many positive UITS experiences. Accessing IU servers has always been easy and quick.  I haven't had too much experience with the UITS staff, but I did need help with Canvas at the beginning of last semester, and it was a positive experience because the employees helped me walk through the process of setting everything up.  The UITS Staff was very helpful when I needed to figure out how to use IUanyWare. They figured out my problem in a quick and efficient manner.  The internet is spotty (I live in Willkie) and my Zoom classes lag a lot.  Overall, have adapted to COVID/online learning very well; always willing to help students who are confused or need help.  I have only had positive experiences so far.  No comments  I have had nothing but positive experiences when dealing with UITS staff or services.  I have not received any issues within the last couple weeks since the second semester has started. I have run into issues that did not need any help, but I am glad to know that there is a system that can help me with issues in the future.  My experience with the IT services were great so far!  I have had positive experiences with the staff. Anytime I have called with questions, they were properly addressed and taken care of.  When I was locked out of my IU account due to a broken phone and losing access to my phone number, UITS was able to help me through the process of getting back into my account before a big test I had that day. I was super stressed about the situation, and the UITS staff on the phone was able to quickly relieve my stress by assuring me they could help with my issue.  Everyone is very friendly! The only issue I have is the long wait time, but I understand.  I have had a really good UITS experience this semester. I have no concerns and have had no negative interactions.  I have had positive experiences with the UITS staff.  I have had a few tech issues during my time here at IU, but luckily through UITS or friends or professors I have figured out my troubles.  None  No concerns  I have not had any experiences with UITS staff so far, so I am unable to answer this question fully. All of my technological needs have not brought up problems.  All the experiences I have had till now with UITS are positive; staff are very willing to help with my problems.   ### Graduate responses:  UITS Staff has always been helpful. I have had two occasions when I went on chat to fix the issues. Both times, I had positive impressions for the help and support I received, and the issues were fixed as well.  UITS staff was exceptional when I first attended IU. They were quick to reply and solve my issue.  I've had good interactions emailing for help. Generally prompt and helpful. Sometimes it is hard to find a telephone number to call. With IT Issues I often just need to talk to someone.  I really love the new restructuring of ONE.iu. It allows me to quickly find the resources I need. I do think there are some resources that are under utilized because people aren't aware of them. However, I can't mention them here because by their very nature I would not know about them. The WIFI in the law school was an issue for the entirety of last year and was a major issue that I felt was not addressed by UITS or the staff. On the other hand, the technology director assigned to the law school is awesome and always has helpful and useful emails he sends out, especially right before finals. The two factor login is annoying and I hate it. Especially because sometimes I don't have good cell signal on campus and can't get my 2nd authentication method.  You retired Box, but there is not an easy way to get to OneDrive storage. Can you make a button for OneDrive that will take me right there? Box was easy to access; make OneDrive easy to access too.  They are very quick in responding. Friendly. Professional. Most of my problems were solved perfectly with their help.  I love the ability to print from any printer around campus, using my student ID. I am dissatisfied with maintenance of printers. These machines are constantly out of service (and not just due to lack of paper and paper jams). WIFI service is great. I've never had a problem. I also love the online software packages available. I have made great use of them. The most burdensome challenge I've experienced was the inability to use Chrome, followed by MS Edge to view my mailBox in-browser. It took too long to solve the problem. That issue created significant obstacles for my productivity level.  Good communication and polite attitude.  Nothing special.  N/A  The duo based single-sign-on technologies ask me to authenticate too often.  There is no easy-access to tutorials/directions on how to configure more than one device as two-step verification tools.  I have contacted the UITS staff by chat a few times, and they have always explored or helped resolve my concern in a timely manner.  Why are we being charged a large tech fee when campus is mostly closed?  Anytime I have had a technology issue, the staff at UITS have been very helpful!  I do not have any recommendations at this time.  My most used service is printing, and I've had great access to printing in the Law library (I'm a law student). Also, the IT support in the law building is great and accessible. Sometimes the wireless internet is patchy on my phone.  I find the staff are resourceful and helpful!  I had to connect with them once over an issue with my local address. They were helpful.  All I meet were fine. But sometimes still find some problems with my school account.  Staff go out of their way to be helpful even when they are not sure of the answer. However, I have not heard back on some of my questions.  I went to IUB for undergrad and am now back for Optometry School. During undergrad, UITS was helpful and provided useful suggestions and solutions. I have only had one encounter with UITS during my time here for graduate school, but that time they were not able to help with the Compulink system we use. Since it is not a campus-wide program, they were not able to help. I was told to contact UITS by the optometry school if I was experiencing problems with Compulink; perhaps IUSO was not updated on the troubleshooting contact.  Availability and knowledge of staff has been great, both for me and my students.  I am very impressed with the receptiveness of the UITS staff. Last semester, [IRD] helped me work through lockdown browser issues that hindered me from taking my Contracts final at the originally allotted time. After [IRD] reset the exam times on Canvas, I was able to take it with no problems. I really appreciated the immediate help.  As an international PhD student, the UITS services are mostly great to my experience, including the communication with some UITS representatives (staffs). For instance, dealing with account- and software-related matters. For the improvement, I think that would be wonderful if some softwares for data analysis (e.g.., MAXQDA, STATA, and others) are available in the section of IUware. The notifications of recent changes and updates on technology-related matters are also well communicated.  Thank you.  I like UITS. If there was one thing to improve, it would be to accelerate IU's exchange email servers as well as Outlook Web Access. Sometimes, these take a while - especially calendars within Outlook Web Access.  The one time I needed help, that staff was very helpful and solved my issue in about 10 minutes.  All the interactions I have had with UITS have been good! Nothing sticks out to me as particularly poor encounters, and I have always been able to get the help I needed.  I have really only had to use the computers on campus to print things, but I have had trouble printing things to a standard size through the print app, and I have also had difficulty locating printers and other work stations on campus as the mobile version of the UITS website has features built only for larger screens.  I would also add that features like IU exchange emails, duo security, and secure vpn might seem appealing to those existing in a cybersecurity bubble; however I would suspect that most students, including myself, find these to be counterproductive headaches for minor security gains.  Freshman year I used UITS at the library to help get Word, Excel, and Powerpoint downloaded onto my computer. I have not had any negative experiences.  I think UITS responded very well to the pandemic and continuing support seamlessly despite everyone working at home. You are appreciated for that, and I thank you.  I read and scan emails every day, and as a long time faculty member it is difficult to keep up with technology. UITS offers so many great resources, but it is difficult for me to read every email that comes through to know what is relevant to me and what is not. I hate OneStart, as a faculty member and as a grad student. It is clunky, not easy to navigate, and I have a hard time finding the classes I need to register for. I feel as if it is an outdated system that IU is trying to continue to use.  One recommendation would be to have all computers on campus have an information messaging screen saver. For example, what events are occurring that day on campus, what new technology has been upgraded or installed that is relevant to students, faculty, and staff. I once sat in a physician office exam room, and while waiting for the physician to come in I was able to watch the screen saver and see all of the events that Community Healthcare System had going on that month pertinent to patients and staff.  Please replace old network systems of northern campus apartments (BBHN, Everman, Redbud) Swain east & west has only one printer, which is always in high demand bc there are many classrooms and office rooms in Swain. Please put more printers at Swain.  No concerns, been great and helpful.  I'm not sure if this comment is related to UITS services, but I really don't like One Drive. IU Box was absolutely better. It's so bad that we had migrated to One Drive; it doesn't work well for shared folders.  I have not had any negative interactions. They were very helpful in addressing problems.  UITS has been very helpful with their different services and also in keeping the student up to date regarding any changes, security threats, etc.  All my experiences with UITS were pretty good.  Positive: using Karst supercomputer for research-related calculations; the supercomputer's team does an excellent job.  Negative: Software access for graduate students. I do not understand the Mathematica license situation.  I have very good experiences with UITS staff when I have had problems with using the IUAnyware. They are very eager to help with finding where the problem comes from, how to resolve the problem, and they will follow up even after the problem is solved. I think it's great to benefit everyone at IU.  Being remote, I haven't used a lot of on campus IT equipment, but when I was having trouble with my email last semester, I emailed our IT guy, and he helped me fix the issue.  UITS staff are always very responsible.  I’ve had many positive and few negative experiences with UITS. Most of the time they’ve been very helpful in fixing issues related to software and downloading things like Word. The negative experiences I’ve had happened when they were unable to help me with a tech related issue and didn’t point me to the correct area that could help.  UITS staff has been helpful when I reach out to them. I appreciate the updates and good communication of what is going on. I think the resources are useful to me as a student.  I have requested an account in our school's machine, and everything goes very smoothly.  I don't think there's enough resource in out IUCAT. For example, this year I'm a TA for course [IRD], but I can't find the textbook in IUCAT. [IRD]  I have had two interactions with IUTS. One was very positive but could not solve my problem. The other was very negative and also could not solve the same problem. I have only slight confidence in UITS capabilities at this time.  Positive: I have always appreciated having access to many great platforms (Adobe, Office, etc.) Negative: do not like having both OneDrive and Google Drive for file storage. I want everything in one place.  The UI of One.IU is very difficult to navigate. The lack of transparency and up-front information with the outage of essential services including Outlook was impossible to navigate. If you cannot sign in, but the only way to get the essential services to by-pass the issue is by signing in, there is a major issue with the system. Furthermore, why are we using Outlook at all when we have the rest of the Google suite? Google calendar and Google drive connect so easily to Gmail, and yet you have us jumping platform to platform for no reason. Finally, if internet security can flag your services as a risk, there is a serious problem. You need to reexamine your system closely, because there are a number of serious, glaring flaws.  I am a new student at IU. After creating my mail id, I faced issues accessing it. I used the UITS live chat feature, and my issue was resolved instantly.  A complaint I have is about the super-computing resource availability. Often on Carbonate, to get a few hundred low-memory jobs (~8Gb) to run, it takes a long time to hit a node. I feel like there should be a separate queue for these jobs, or there could be nodes with different resource availability. Often, I feel that I'm having to deal with people running hundreds of jobs that request 16 cores... which clogs up the nodes.  Also, is there a replacement for Karst yet?  Also, Big Red is too confusing to use, and therefore I do not find it useful for my needs.  Research desktop is great--I don't think this survey mentioned this. It's facilitates a lot of the work I do... not because its a GUI for the grid, but because it enables me to organize my projects and transition between lab and home computer.  They have been quick to respond to concerns.  The printers in the Kelley school of business were down for the entire semester. I wish the breakout rooms had a little bit more technology within them.  They are so helpful, thanks!  I have reached out to UITS couple of times initially for the issues regarding my account activation, and they have always responded to me in time and have resolved the issues within the given window.  I’m really not looking forward to my email access being changed for the second time in a year (Umail, Exchange, and now changing to something else). Also, the migration from Box to Drive was a huge pain.  I haven't been with the university for very long, but I appreciate the timely responses of the UITS staff.  It has been really frustrating to deal with multiple e-mail migrations over the past couple months. Also, I don't understand why Box has been discontinued, and I don't feel that enough support has been given in terms of demonstrating better alternatives for those of us working with lots of data.  I feel pretty satisfied with the IT support from the university.  All of the people I have corresponded with about high-performance computing have been wonderful. The responses are helpful and prompt. All other UITS interactions (via chat or phone) have been unhelpful. I'm often given a link to a knowledge base page that I have already looked through, or I'm talked down to like I know nothing about computing. Because of this, I do not contact UITS anymore for help unless it is for high performance computing stuff.  I've had several conversations with the UITS team in the last few months. All of which have solved or were able to troubleshoot my initial issue, as well as answer additional questions. I think the availability and the wait (usually never more than 10mins or so during busiest business hours) have been reasonable. I've found that my preferred method is phone conversations, although I have used the chat feature.  My experience with UITS has been positive. I've generally been able to access the services I need without issue. On the few occasions when I've contacted the support center, the issue has been satisfactorily resolved.  No recommendation.  Never used UITS since Covid. Should've defunded the department and given student money to pay for high speed WIFI for better education quality.  UITS has been very kind and helpful this year in several instances when I have needed their assistance I've used the chat service once to work out an issue with my email, and the staff member was very patient and helpful. I was very thankful for his assistance.  I know many students expressed issues with the Examsoft hardware for proctoring exams. Thankfully I did not need to download that for exams, though that may change in the future. Outside of that, I have had no concerns or negative interactions from my virtual school experience. I would recommend a different software program because I know the Examsoft has been an unpopular one amongst my peers. I would also add many law students would prefer to use Gmail instead of Outlook, but are unable to. Kaltura would also benefit from better subtitles on videos (not sure how that is possible, but have heard and seen issues).  I really haven't had much interaction with UITS.  Very friendly staff at Wells library.  Fast response for online communication regarding tech issue.  They have generally been helpful. Internet service is not good.  The Student Center application should be updated. I felt--seeing those HTML pages--it stands out of the rest of IU websites  I once had to rent an adapter cable for a presentation. Staff were very helpful.  The pre-recorded lectures and PowerPoint slides are not on my Canvas.  I was told that I would get a response in 5 days, but that is after my assignments are due.  I find Citrix Receiver to be frustrating at times, particularly when applications (e.g., Stata and SPSS) don't work when I'm trying to use a dual monitor. I have found no fix for this.  They are very nice and always happy to help.  So far I did not have bad experiences from UITS staff; they were really helpful.  1)          Box migration could have been done better (I understand there was a deadline to migrate all the data, but it was not clear when will the migration of individual and group accounts start (there was only a window provided) and I learned the fact that BoxNotes will not even get migrated after the migration). In the end, good job on getting this major project done.  2)          Migration to Outlook/Office 365 was great. Office 365 as a product has plenty to be desired. I do appreciate the training and presentations which started taking place after the migration (or at least I started noticing them after accounts I and my team uses were migrated).  3)          Hopefully Microsoft Teams will add more features before UITS leaves Slack.  The internet speed/bandwidth of Redbud Hill Apartments is too slow/small. Everything is online these days, and people are spending much more time at their own unit than before. For example, usually I could download everything I need in my office with a relatively faster speed using eduroam, but now it takes so long to do the same thing with a bandwidth of only 10M. So, the drawback of low bandwidth is amplified when staying at home everyday, and I have to spend significantly more time for these things. This is just the case when I am the only resident in my unit, and I couldn't imagine what the internet would look like if there will be a roommate in the future, probably a disaster. But living alone without a roommate also means paying more rent. So, I sincerely wish/demand UITS could improve the internet service in my apartment with at least a modern-level bandwidth like 50M. I think it's technically possible and reasonable, since the occupancy rate of on-campus apartments these days is pretty low. Thanks!  Pros: The free software. IUAnywhere is a god-send. 24 hour UITS line. Cons: Too many updates and changes. Reverting to Adobe Acrobat 2017 (from DC (a downgrade)). UITS phone line staff often don't have answers. Utter confusion with changes in signals (IU secure, IU guest, Eduroam,etc). Discontinuation of Box and no longer able to use Box Edit (catastrophic). Though wide, not tall enough Windows computer monitors in labs. Not enough MACs in labs at all (and none at all in most labs).  Recommendations: More training for staff. More standing desks on campus. A better and more user- friendly mobile app. Live updated website/section of IU app that shows which labs are open on campus (and directions/location) and status; so many building have different hours, and I feel like I have to move around so much).  UITS has always been very helpful!  All are good.  Not a big fan of Outlook on a browser. Life would be a lot easier if we could get Microsoft Outlook the application to stay on top of emails.  I have not had any bad interactions with UITS staff. An additional suggestion past COVID would be the lending of graphing calculators or usb cords. My undergraduate university would lend out graphing calculators, usb cords, laptops, and headphones. I would have appreciated this throughout my graduate program.  N/A  I think a continuation on customer service is needed. While UITS hasn't always done everything I wanted, I've always been pleased by their service.  I had a couple of issues with my PC during the semester, but they were always quickly handled.  I have had no problems with the staff. They have been very responsive and helpful. However, I would have preferred more storage in my scratch or no backup space since we are all working from home or easier ways/access from home to high storage space and its linking to computer clusters like silo, gh, kj etc.  I had a great experience with the UITS team in the very first week when I arrived at Bloomington. I had changed my Mobile phone, and I wasn't able to access the Duo Mobile application. I contacted the UITS team, and they solved my issue in 10 minutes with proper identity verification. Due to their quick actions, I was able to book my classes on time.  I really appreciate UITS staff! I haven't had to personally reach out to them because their videos on common issues are so instructive and helpful.  The base offerings of UITS--software, Canvas-based learning courses, file storage, etc.--are excellent. At IU, I feel like I have all the technology resources I could ever need to do my job and learn.  The one drawback with UITS is huge: customer service is abysmal if not completely absent. As a student and a staff supervisor (in a space that houses a UITS STC), I am continually thwarted and frustrated by the complete lack of customer service orientation with UITS. When there is a representative present (which is rare lately), they are moderately helpful--if you can find them. When we call for a consultant, no one shows up. The equipment itself functions maybe 50% of the time; that is not an exaggeration. How is it that printing functions are inoperable *campus wide* at the beginning of EVERY semester? The worst part about that is that UITS never has to answer for it, I do. But I have no power to effect a solution. That's very frustrating. And after 3 years of no intervention by UITS, this is now intentional on their part: UITS is choosing not to address the problem.  I've had a lot of positive interactions with the staff at Support Center Tier 2. My concern is that they are understaffed, and as hard as they are working, it is difficult for them to provide the level of service that they want and the IU community needs since they are buried under tickets. My other issue that I would love to see addressed is to provide more training for the IU community to be able to transition to using Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Power Platform (Power Apps and Power Automate). These are excellent tools to be able to use, but we don't seem to have a dedicated team who can assist people with questions on best practices and troubleshooting.  My experience with IT has been minimal, but when I have needed help (my Canvas was acting up), response was prompt and helpful. If you guys don't already have this, with the pandemic, it may be helpful to have Zoom appointments, since then you guys would be able to take control of the computer without being in person.  I've had great experiences with UITS this semester. [IRD] was a great help when I was looking to get a Zoom Webinar license for the department. [IRD], [IRD], and [IRD] were wonderful to work with in getting Badgr set up for my class this semester with a limited time frame. I have also been taking advantage of the Adobe Creative Suite for a number of projects and will continue to explore its use this semester in a class with [IRD]. I would love for Badgr to be fully adopted--it could have a lot of interesting uses in the classroom. We're also having a little difficulty accessing Adobe Stock, but it seems like that is being looked into.  UITS Staff has been generally responsive. I honestly don't know if UITS Supports my office though. The structure between UITS and TechSelect is unclear as an outsider.  So far I have had good experience with the UITS except a few mentioned below:  1)          I feel every time logging into IU portal (Mail. One.iu and Canvas) becomes a little tedious due to constantly asking for Duo verification.  2)          When logging into Zoom(opening the Zoom desktop app), when I put my IU user name and paraphrase, I am unable to login, and it shows that the credentials are wrong. But when I open Zoom at iu in the web browser, its asks me to put in the meeting id. Also I am unable to join via the link sent by the professor.  I also feel that if there were ways like small tutorials kind of videos to show how to best make use of the services, it would be a better experience for the students.  All of my interactions with UITS have been positive. Staff is knowledgeable and friendly and always prompt when answering requests.  I like One.IU, but wish it was easier for me as an online only student to find IU library search databases.  There is a consistent lack of competent (or even present) customer service at the libraries, specifically to service the printers. I have myself experienced and seen dozens of others in situations where there was an issue with logging into a computer or printing on a university printer that was never resolved. The phone line is almost always unhelpful in these situations, and it is usually the resource that's used, as there are not usually staff on site to help.  UITS always responds in a timely matter to issues--which is much appreciated. I know, especially with this year, that things must be quite difficult for the UITS team, but I can assure you--from a student perspective--that their hard work is greatly appreciated.  My only major complaint with tech at IU is the requirement of DUO to do everything. I can't even check my email on my phone without going through DUO each time I check, and it's a major inconvenience. I don't understand why we need it. Especially since IU already takes such great lengths with account security through using such long passwords. I think it would be sufficient to only use one or the other.  Please note: I am an optometry student, so my responses are mostly tailored to the optometry building as I have only ventured to Wells library a handful of times for IT help--which has always been wonderful. However, I think having help on the south side of campus has much left to be desired. The optometry school itself has rather outdated technology that only works 50% of the time and 1 non-colored printer. With being 1/22 schools in the nation, you would think IU would work harder to make the optometry school nicer.  I am a new student here, till now I don't have any recommendations. Once I start using the services more, I will be able to give an informed answer on this.  For the brief experience that I have had, I can say that I miss not using Google and its suites (docs, sheets, drive...). It makes interacting with internal groups (same class, same batch) easier. Haven't used Outlook much yet so can't comment on how productive it can be.  Regarding communications, I wish there were a universal channel, be it slack or piazza or qa community. Plethora of choices is confusing, as you have to keep track of where your historical class conversations are etc.  I think for me there's a lot of confusion as to what department deals with which thing. I wonder if there's a way to make this easier for those of us who have problems that need to be addressed.  UITS staff has been extremely helpful. I've had positive experiences with UITS staff that also serve a adjunct faculty. I took a cloud computing class with [IRD] from UITS and O'Neill school, and as a student this has been helpful to have a connection with an employee of UITS in an academic setting.  I mostly have only worked with SPH IT staff, and they are wonderful. I do not even know if I have interacted with UITS staff on my own.  I had a great interaction with UITS when I picked up a hotspot for my wife (an IU PhD student). [IRD] was the person who I met to pick up the device, and he explained everything very clearly and was super pleasant to speak with. I would be happy to run into [IRD] again!  I have only ever had very courteous and pleasant interactions with UITS staff. I especially appreciate that UITS staff members consult each other if they are unsure about an issue. I would appreciate it if UITS could update the IU networks so that they are compatible with the latest Android security update.  I am an international student, and I have to say it is a huge impact the process for applying and being enrolled at universities in the States. But it really makes a difference to always have someone to call or write specially in this specific situation, where the in-person interaction has been taken out of the options.  A few times when I needed some help I used live chat, and each time the technician was polite, patient, and helped with the issue. Also, a couple of times I had to call the UITS, and again each time I received help, and the problem was solved.  I use Canvas on a daily basis for the courses I took, and it helps a lot to organize online classes and have the schedule for assignments and due dates.  I have just been using UITS services for a few month now. The services are presently satisfactory to me.  I have often used Knowledge Base as a helpful reference. and in the past have been several times to the in-person tech support in Wells. Both have been very appreciated.  I have only had one recent interaction with UITS staff, and they were very nice and helpful. I appreciated that they did not treat me like I was dumb even though I do not know much about technology. The migration to the new Outlook email was hard to get used to. It would have been less stressful to have been migrated during the summer when the university is not as busy.  I did have an issue with losing Microsoft Office on my laptop and downloading it again. I understand that it counts the number of times I download the programs, but it would have been nice if it recognized that I had downloaded to the same device before. This wasn't really pressing since we can download the programs five times.  Haven't had any issues.  I've been enjoying the chat-based help desk services.  I'm glad one.iu.edu exists for finding things in the student center, because otherwise I would never find anything.  In general, UITS has done a good job supporting us during the pandemic. So far I have not had an occasion to seek additional specific help and therefore can't comment beyond that.  Faculty, staff, and students should not have to pay a fee for Mathematica.  I love our UITS staff at IUN! They are all so helpful.  As indicated in my responses, my primary concern is how difficult it is to install software and script packages onto my school desktop as a result of policies related to the use of Macs on campus.  Although these policies may be helpful in many contexts, it is difficult when you are using different script packages that must be downloaded.  I interacted with UITS once this past year via the online chat. I was having issues using an IUAnyware app. The experience was pleasant, and my problem was resolved.  You are removing Mathematica from campus-wide licensing. This is okay. But, to buy a license through IU is more expensive than buying a license through Wolfram-Alpha and this does not make any sense to me.  The experience with UITS staff was awesome. I have faced some issues. And facing some. You can improve on that.  (i)          I was facing problem for login on my iu account in my mobile from a long time. I could login in laptop but when I login in my cellphone it says wrong username or password. I have contacted to the staff but they also couldn't help on this. However just a few days ago it started working automatically, I don't know how but now I can also login on my cellphone and use iu facilities.  (ii)         The IU guest internet and internet in the campus is very bad, it doesn't work at all. Please work on this and provide a good internet through out the campus.  (iii)        I sit in chemistry department and the internet connectivity there also in some rooms are very bad. In my office, wifi doesn't work good, it get disconnected or have poor connection. That affects my lectures and hence that's very irritating. Many time I have faced this, problem during my lectures, please work on it.  (iv)        I have ubuntu machine and IU VPN doesn't work there I don't know it's my laptop problem or an issue from your side. Please help me with that too.  In the fall my exchange account disappeared unexpectedly. When I called UITS, the representative was very helpful in communicating that there was a migration happening and helped me set my email up on my desktop, since exchange was unlikely to be available to me again soon. I was annoyed that I hadn't been aware of the change before it happened, but I immediately received all the help I needed to solve the problem.  I have had positive experiences with UITS staff at Wells Library and remotely.  I do not have any comments at this time.  Sending in questions regarding adobe.  Great excel course!!  No comments  All interactions have been positive & helpful  Printing often doesn't work or the printer is out of ink.  I have not had many interactions recently, but I did in undergrad, and they helped out then fairly easily.  Any encounter that I have had with the UITS team has been great  I had trouble logging into my Citrix Workspace account, and a UITS staff member helped me through distant screen control. I turn to the UITS 24/7 chat function whenever I can't solve a technical problem myself since then.  My quibble is I don't need as much printing quota as I pay for each semester. I hope the 40.00USD printing quota of my technology fee can be optional.  I used to rely on on-campus computer labs for completing all my coursework over the first two years at IU, but that's no longer possible. Mask-wearing policy is hardly enforced, and someone talking aloud on the phone without a mask in the computer lab makes it difficult for me to access technology services.  I have reported a fishing attempt from an IUPUI faculty member to UITS, and they reassured me that they were handling the situation. They could've given me advice regarding how to secure my account. Also, I have used the printing service for posters in the library, and they went as far as to help me figure out what size poster that I needed.  UITS services and staff have been very supportive whenever I needed any sort of help.  I have not had any issues that prompted directed engagement with UITS staff or services.  UITS service has been good so far.  My only complaint is, it is super slow to code on a server like carbonate.  I have had mostly positive experiences with UITS, especially over the phone; the reps have been helpful and cheerful in working out the problems I'm experiencing. I have occasionally had issues with communicating with reps over live chat, who give answers that I later find out over the phone are incorrect.  One specific issue I have been encountering is that the Knowledge Base/help resources for IU List are not very intuitive, especially the help resources within the interface, which seem to be designed for a much more advanced user than I am as a list administrator.  Availability of 3D printer labs has been challenging over the past year.  My experiences with UITS have been mostly positive. EITS has been a great help in troubleshooting issues with my workstation, and I've had particularly good experiences with [IRD] and [IRD] in this regard. If I had any suggestions for improvement, it would be that I'd like to see more EdCert courses offered. I took one course on CompTIA Linux+ and found it to be both valuable and enjoyable.  I don't know, offhand.  I would like to be able to remain logged in to my IU account on my iOS devices. I am unable to check “remember me for 7 days” on my phone (cookies?). I really appreciate the range of software available to IU students, like Microsoft Office and Adobe Creative Cloud. Having the full version of Zoom is amazing. I like how one.IU.edu is very easy to navigate.  I've received some good support and some not-so-good support from UITS over chat. It seems that sometimes my questions were not considered thoughtfully before an answer was given, or the person did not seem to have a basic working knowledge of a very common problem. From doing my own document searches, I was able to get farther than when I contacted UITS. But the documentation is not super great too, so it took me hours. Sometimes the links send you in article-loops, where you expect the next article will offer instructions, but it is just another high-level \"about\"-type article, with links to other articles, which also do not provide instructions.  I get asked to provide my user credentials and Duo authentication way too many times. Particularly using the high performance computing services and scholarly data archive. It's not uncommon for me to be asked a dozen times in a morning. It drives me crazy. These services definitely need a \"remember me for 24 hours\" button or something similar.  I've found UITS support to be extremely friendly and helpful.  Overall, my experience is positive so far.  Please revise the use fee for matlab and mathmatica, especially for those doing graduate research. A) We pay a technology fee B) the funding for it would either come out of our own pocket (for those of us making 20k a year) or out of our PI's budget. Sometimes we just need to use it to look at other peoples code, or to translate legacy code to other platforms. Fine if we transition courses off of using them, but we shouldn't limit the research of graduate students.  The Kuali platform for payroll of GA needs improvement. There should be option to delete entries of working hours from the calendar (with permission, of course) if someone forgot to punch out.  Helpful staff. I was able to get my issues resolved quickly.  They helped me fix a Wifi issue with my laptop when I first got here. Very efficient.  I had experienced a fraudulent email and UITS helped me immediately solve the query.  Only positive in general, nothing negative.  WiFi provided on campus is often unreliable and spotty for personal devices. Microsoft Office/Exchange offered through UITS is difficult to navigate and while a more secure platform, a very inaccessible suite for sharing documents, resources, and even for email.  Overall, I've had incredible experiences using Zoom as provided through the university, and Canvas, and feel confident in those platforms as they're hosted at IU.  Also, I'm unsure where to go for many IT concerns as it relates to necessary coursework and resources.  Overall, I have really appreciated UITS staff and services. I primarily work with Chem ITG, but they are incredibly helpful. Overall, I do not appreciate the constant updates to technology (for instance, I have an exchange email account, which has to be transferred next week, just like every piece of IU tech I've used has had to have been over the past year). Otherwise, I work with research technologies, and that would be where most of my issues lie, insofar as the new supercomputer is slow and monthly updates seem overly extensive.  I got help installing SPSS on my MacBook pre-covid, and over the summer of 2020 my friend contacted the university to help with the installation of SPSS  They are helpful on solving the issues.  No comments. Everything has been good so far.  I've always had good experiences with UITS. I used to be a staff member, and UITS often helped me with managing our department website. I'm currently a graduate student and instructor. Since becoming a graduate student I haven't utilized UITS very much, if at all.  I called UITS to get help with connecting to meetings, and the support member was so helpful and patient with me. They kindly walked me step by step through the troubleshooting process. Going forward I think it would be helpful to make a troubleshooting guide available for Zoom and other applications, especially related to MacOS updates (e.g., Catalina and Big Sur).  Things went fine with connecting for my loaner computer, but Im annoyed I cannot download software. Example: adobe tries to update everytime i log in, and i cant. It's a huge annoyance.  My colleagues at UITS Have always been positively supportive, skilled in the areas of my questions, and/ or referred me to the correct resources. They have helped resolve all issues.  I called UITS for a Carbonate question, and they helped me find the correct department. I emailed the HPS team and heard back very quickly. I've communicated with [IRD] before, and this person is always very helpful. Today [IRD] provided me with the webpage I needed for steps to solve my issue, and it was super fast. I don't know how [IRD] knows so much; they're a wizard with this computer stuff that frustrates me so. I really appreciate that IU has these help services. My question was answered, and I am a satisfied student!  Great service of UITS  I have a suggestion regarding Kaltura video viewing in Canvas. When we bring our cursor over the Kaltura player in Canvas, the player does not automatically bring up the dialog Box to skip or change the speed of the video. Instead, we need to click on the player and make the video pause in order to make the dialog Box pop up.  UITS has always seemed very helpful to me, though I rarely need help from them.  I've had positive experiences overall with UITS. WiFi could be stronger, and the printers in the Jacobs library need to be more reliable. There should probably be more printers as well - music students have to print LOTS of music.  My only suggestion would be to allow for more than 7 days wherein the Two-Factor Authentication remembers us and allows us to sign in more quickly. A small suggestion, and really is only a nuisance to have to keep doing it.  Applying to my online grad program, finding my courses, and scheduling those courses involve an immense amount of unintuitive and disconnected tasks. There are multiple locations to find what courses are available, and each one provides a different amount of information. Although scheduling courses is done through just one place, that one place is entirely unintuitive, particularly once you have selected the course and want to finish enrolling. There should be one system for looking for your course, for finding out the info about it (including the details of the course and the survey records for the course and instructor), and for enrolling in the course. There should be one page that branches down into each school you may be interested in. IU needs to actually be One.IU. And this system needs to be the same across all campuses. I can't imagine these issues would have been intentionally left had a UX expert followed even a small number of students through the application and enrollment process. One.iu.edu is not a single tool. It is a search engine to help parse the myriad of tools, and it is appreciated as compared to how things used to be, but what is really needed is just an iu.edu where anything and everything related to me lives in a coherent and non-duplicative format. Thank you for listening!  I have noticed on Zoom that some users bypass the waiting room feature for no apparent reason.  The online chat service is really helpful, and also they are responding whenever we have a problem in any relevant area.  I have a had a very good experience with UITS staff and services. At the beginning of my studies at IU, I had encountered problems with my username and password, and I have had assistance from UITS staff with very good results.  Staff at the Kelley MBA building have always been quite helpful.  Wi-fi issues on the second floor of the Kelley MBA building have caused class disruptions.  A few days ago, I was unable to connect to the building printers via the BYOD drivers on my laptop.  I had trouble logging into my email and tried the live web chat, and it was really useful.  I don't have any suggestions at this moment, just a small complaint: I understand that the use of Canvas and other resources has increased a lot with Covid, but the internet connection has been really unstable in some buildings - I don't know if this is related. This has really been an issue when teaching synchronically through Zoom.  When I first started my journey to coming here, I felt like I wasn't wanted here because I wasn't getting any questions answered or any help even getting going. I'm not sure if this had something to do with tech, but I just wanted someone to know.  IUanyware (SAS) often failed to save my documents (unless I named them as something else).  N/A  I have had no negative experiences thus far!  I have none.  Students should be more aware of UITS staff and services. The information available can sometimes be too complex for those who are not technology savvy. UITS staff, in person, has always been helpful and kind when I had an IT problem.  They were very quick to responding to my question and gave me a solution! Very pleasant!  I hate how systems are always changing. I feel like I always have to learn something new.  UITS has helped when I needed to download software on a work computer (very helpful!) and worked quickly to troubleshoot an issue when I spilled some water on my touchpad and inquired about borrowing a mouse (also very helpful).  I’ve always had great service when needed.  No  Generally, I am satisfied with how UITS staff assist me. However, on my latest call to UITS call center, I have to wait like more than 10 minutes, although I am informed that there is no caller ahead of me.  I have not directly contacted UITS so far  NA  Everything has been great thus far.  N/A  The printer page is a little bit confusing, it could not based on my device location data to adjust the printer showing order. I have not figured out how to use the printer selection on the website, so I could only use the swiping crim card on the printer methods.  I haven't used the high-performance computing resources yet for my coursework. I eventually will. I am happy and grateful for all of the resources available to us here at IUB. Thank you!  I have had a great experience with the UITS, and I liked all the service that you offer  I have contacted UITS twice in the last year, once because I couldn't access IU Email, and once because I couldn't access Adobe Stock. Both times they responded quickly, followed up within a few days, and either resolved the issue or found workarounds within a week. I have no complaints.  I really take advantage of IUanyware and in particular the virtual desktops. I use it every day for work. A problem I have, though, is with downloads from the Chrome browser. I get pop ups that I can't open the file location when it's downloaded. I then have to open the file and save it in a new location. This occurs quite a lot in my work.  I've had a lot of positive experiences using the UITS support chat - I think it's a great resource and the people answering questions have always been extremely helpful, courteous, and professional. I am also very grateful for the support of our department IT Manager, Jack Thomas [IRD], who always goes above and beyond to help with our IT needs and answer questions.  Since I was an IUB staff member before I returned to school there have been a lot of complications with my accounts (for example, not allowing interlibrary loans even though I was a graduate student at IUB because I was a previously a staff member). It has made my UX with UITS services (staff are wonderful!) somewhat negative. It tends to make me feel like an outsider since I'm a nontraditional student with a background that is different from most IUB students.  Student Center is not as intuitive as I would prefer. It can be difficult to find the information I'm looking for. I also have had a difficult time finding my Bursar account balance after my scholarship and student loan and scholarship disbursement information after my IU bill has been paid.  The services that I have used were very easy to access. Services like Carbonate, Canvas, Piazza, Box etc are very helpful for an IU student. They have helped me in understanding the course and in doing assignments.  I hate duo.  Not sure if this review related to UITS though. I suggest that the login process with the Duo Mobile can be automatically linked back to the page users are using. I know it works on the computer successfully, but when you are using a mobile phone and approved, the user has to close the Duo Mobile app then go back to the login page.  The connectivity and stability of Wi-Fi need to be improved.  Whenever I have had a technological issue, it was usually quickly resolved. My only problem was last semester when Microsoft Outlook and Canvas had connectivity issues with certain browsers.  I'm very satisfied with my interactions with UITS. I contacted them a couple of times for help with Zoom and Canvas. They were very knowledgeable and helpful. In both cases, they requested that I share my screen — to my surprise, it was more fluid than expected. They were able to jump on my computer and help out. I'm tech-savvy, but there are some limitations when it comes to specific functionality, and so the desktop connect was a great advantage.  n/a  UITS staff have been excellent in aiding professors during the live/online class sessions - they always respond quickly and offer great support.  Printing from my personal laptop to IU printers has not been working. i know there is a migration going on, but this needs to be resolved ASAP. Additionally, printing stations are hit or miss - some print with lines on the paper, others work just fine.  Overall, I have been very satisfied with the help I've received from UITS, and I've been particularly appreciative this year. They've pulled me out of a crisis more than once. That said, last semester I was having terrible trouble with Canvas and despite multiple consultations (phone calls and emails), no one could identify the problem. It was only after it happened again that a new UITS person told me what it was: that you cannot copy old assignments on Canvas and then edit them to suit your needs for a new assignment. I cannot tell you the kinds of frustration the students and I had over this. I feel like this could have been avoided if we had received some basic training in Canvas before the school year started. I am not talking about just saying, \"Here are some videos if you need help on Canvas.\" I am talking about making sure every single instructor receives the same basic training that includes things like what I just mentioned and also how to back up your site and how to work from a practice site.  Get rid of duo, or at least extend the amount of time we don’t have to log in. Also, the save does not work for certain Apple devices.  I haven't had any direct interactions with UITS staff yet, but their helpline comes highly recommended from my professors. As for the online resources available, I've found them to be fairly helpful. Any tech issue I've run into so far has a solution. This includes setting up Microsoft Exchange and trying to learn more about eduroam, among other things.  Always helpful.  I think that the staff responds quickly and clearly via email.  Any time that I have reached out to UITS staff, they have been super friendly and knowledgeable on the issue I am having. If they do not have a response to my question, they make sure to research it, provide me with resources, and/or ask others who can help us. I happen to always reach out when I am working in the early AM hours, so it's been nice to know that I can request help any time I may need it.  I have contacted the UITS staff only once when I was unable to access my IU Exchange account. I received a reply almost immediately and the problem was resolved within a day. Appreciate the swift support.  There are a lack of wifi routers in Merrill Hall; some rooms have very weak signal.  I have had two experiences: one was when I needed to add a new number to my DUO account and was out of the country - the staff was extremely helpful on the phone while maintaining my personal security. Second was when I went to the IT center for verification of Duo Mobile, and they were helpful there as well.  The Knowledge Base is a lifesaver.  Compulink learning often fails to work. Also, I don’t like how we have to sign into Zoom through IU.  Outlook is a really hard email system to use. I would highly recommend switching to Google. Many other schools use Google , and it's much easier to use, especially for those who have a MacBook. Exchange is not conducive to the work I do.  Good service. Mitigation testing information forms for people not living in Bloomington got somewhat confusing last semester, but that has improved so far this semester.  I've always had good experiences with UITS because they respond immediately to my issues and offer quality troubleshooting and solution suggestions.  I have not had to contact a UITS this year.  An IU IT person was very helpful and nice when there was an unauthorized use of my account-they locked it for me and helped change my password.  I wish the exchange email migration had been handled a little differently, on the other hand: that we could have had some choice as to when our account migrated.  Responses are very helpful from UITS team. UITS team is always enthusiastic to help.  I have classes that require use of Github and Docker. Learning these technologies in isolation consumes a lot of time. It would be nice if a \"Getting Started\" type tutorial to give you the \"lay of the land\" of these technologies was offered.  Zoom is okay but I personally would prefer Microsoft Teams.  I love that we get Adobe software, Microsoft Office and SharePoint software, etc. for free. These are critical software in industry, and its nice they are offered.  For Python and R, it would be nice if there was a \"trusted packages\" list from UITS so we know whether or not a package has malicious intent.  Move storage away from Google to Microsoft. Google has privacy concerns.  The one thing I wish IU had that it does not currently is an Asana license. Some of the advanced features of Asana are really nice to have, and wish I could use those for class.  Overall, I try to utilize all the technologies offered by IU that I can. There is critical software, and I'm going to miss being able to utilize these resources when I graduate.  Not many specific comments. I think the the self-service center on One.IU.edu could use some cosmetic updates.  UITS support for distance graduate students has been excellent.  IU's Covid-19 mitigation testing system used to send reminder emails shortly before a scheduled testing appointment, which was a helpful reminder of the appointment itself and a good reminder to not eat or drink before the appointment, but it stopped several weeks ago. I really wish it would be brought back.  Additionally, I really wish that there was a way to access campus wifi when studying in more outdoor spaces, like in the wooded areas south of Woodburn Hall or north of Forest. I understand that there may be technical limitations, but even having stronger wifi in buildings that could extend a bit more into outdoor areas could be helpful, especially during the pandemic.  I am generally quite satisfied with UITS' service.  UITS has been generally okay. They have been a lot of help when I've needed to print big research posters in the library. Some people are more helpful than others, and I did have one issue with my laptop not connecting to any IU-affiliated wifi that UITS was never able to solve.  I have only had pleasant experiences with the UITS staff.  I had a great experience with a UITS representative through email, tackling some potential data loss in Box.  Once I had my computer system broken, I brought my computer to Luddy Hall's UITS student services. The student volunteers were very nice and patient and helped me contact the specialist, who can better deal with my operating system problem. After I brought my computer to the specialist, she helped me re-install the system and kept all my documents, without losing any of them. My problem was solved perfectly within one day, and I was really satisfied and happy with the experience with UITS.  The waiting message could be more friendly. Though informative, the message does not affect the level of stress I experience when my homework disappears.  I've had friendly interactions with the employees, although at times it takes quite a while for someone to respond to you. I do appreciate the availability of tools, software and other resources.  Printing has always been an issue though, and students should be allowed compensation when they cannot utilize the printers on campus (due to them not functioning), and they must seek printing resources outside of campus.  I felt reticent to answer a UITS ticket response I received as the associate asked only questions that were answered in my initial ticket, and it felt like my concern wasn't being taken seriously. I opened my ticket on a Thursday, and it was closed on a Sunday after I did not respond - I had not yet returned to campus to be able to try different strategies. I ended up troubleshooting and solving my issue on my own. Additional training for staff to better respond to user submitted tickets could be really helpful.  The few interactions I have had with UITS staff have been professional, helpful, and brief. Most of their online services have worked well for me so far.  I have not had any direct interaction with UITS staff. However, I would like to be able to print to a campus printer using my personal device. The computer that is available for printing in my graduate office is very slow and outdated. It is a hassle to get it up and going just to print.  The only recommendation is WIFI connectivity in blind spots of the campus.  None, UITS has been extremely helpful.  There has always been someone helpful sitting in the first floor of the Cook Music Library to help with technology issues, which is great. The internet across campus is very helpful, especially during COVID. I have also found the access to all of the one.iu.edu services to work well. The only thing that sometimes does not work well is that the IUCAT search option filtering is not as effective as I would like.  I've had an overall positive response with UITS staff and services. Whenever I have a question, the response time is pretty fast, and if the person doesn't know the answer, they are able to point me to someone who might.  Nothing, everything seems great.  UITS mostly operates under the radar for me. When I have any problems they are usually able to help, but that is rare for me. I use a number of services but rarely think much about UITS to be honest.  na  I live off campus and take an entirely virtual and asynchronous curriculum. I haven't had many issues with IU tech services and have found them to be generally reliable. I attended IUPUI for undergrad in person and found tech services and support to be satisfactory for all my needs.  The only concern I've had is the apparent removal of Finale software from the computers in the Music Library, and the unreliable functionality of the MIDI keyboards there.  I have not had much personal experience with UITS, but it seems like they are helpful.  The wifi in the music buildings is very unreliable.  No  Miss me with all the ThAtS NoT My DePaRTMeNt when I tell you a printer isn't working on the network. Forward the email yourself, damn.  Last year I had some problems having my IU email account. I contacted the UITS and it turned to be that my birthday was typed wrong by myself when filling the registration information. The guy helped me very quickly.  But after I corrected my birthday information, I still met some problems having my email account. I think the webpage related to this question still has the extent to be improved.  I moved in to campus housing and needed to set up the internet. Originally I was scheduled for that service 3 weeks later since I moved in, but the staff found that that was too long for me to wait. So I was rescheduled for the service a couple of days after I requested it. The fact that the staff proactively tried to provide a timely service was very impressive.  Before the virus hit, I occasionally used UITS services at Wells Library. I always found the staff to be helpful and professional. I have not had to use UITS since last March.  Positive experience with the IRB program use with prompt explanations and feedback.  I like that they are always available.  Always get great people on the Bloomington call-in number.  I never faced any issues ever. I feel UITS respond well on time.  I have called the UITS staff for issues with CompuLink, and they do not deal with the system, BUT the gentleman I spoke to found out who to call, put us on a conference call, and got me set up in the system when I got my password. He literally gave me THE best customer service I have ever had. I really wish I had remembered his name!  No  For the most part, my experiences with UITS have been great. The staff are professional and helpful and seem genuinely interested in solving the problem. They are also patient. As a distance student these past years, their help has been particularly valuable.  I had to format my computer and the UITS staff at the Wells Library had been very helpful. Also, I had problems with my domestic internet connection and the UITS personnel helped me resolve the issue.  UITS has always solved my problems super quickly and been really nice, I appreciate them!  UITS is extremely helpful with my requests for assistance. I am more concerned about some of the technology choices as opposed to the characteristics of UITS staff.  The mitigation testing is ridiculous; when I am out of town I can't get my exemptions accepted, and I am pulled constantly. Also with Duo login it is difficult to get onto your account if your phone breaks, and you can't change your number easily.  I had trouble trying to get an experiment online, and when I asked, I was told that UITS could not help me with this problem. I found this to be a bit odd and confusing, and ended up having to figure it out on my own.  Nope, it’s all good.  The supercomputing for everyone webinar series is nice, but it would be better if they were more accessible to people who are fully unfamiliar with the topic. For instance, I attended one on NVIDIA computing, and the talk was full of NVIDIA jargon/packages I was not familiar with.  I have called UITS a few times with Canvas related issues. They have always done all that they can to help and have been awesome to work with.  All experiences I’ve had are positive. Only complaint I’ve had is professors and not tech services.  N/A  I have received great help from UITS over the phone to fix issues on my work computer. However, the chat feature was less than stellar and almost non-responsive.  Back in October I could not access IU Exchange for several weeks, which negatively impacted my research since I needed that secure account to communicate with participants. Although I contacted UITS they were completely unhelpful. In the past, I wanted to create my own web page through IU. However, I found both the process and the help pages completely arcane, even though I have some experience with computer programming.  I always have wonderful experience with working with the support center staff at IU South Bend and IU Bloomington. Always very helpful.  Please work on making the printers in the law school more reliable.  N/A  Adopt GoReact for non-fee use to students and faculty. Find ways to boost the upload/download and viewing bandwidth for Kaltura; the increased university-wide use is making it harder and harder to be able to rely on this.  I think the only time I've used UITS services was back when we could teach in person, and I would call with tech issues from the classroom. The staff was always really responsive and helpful.  The only real complaint I've ever had with the technology at IU is that it can be difficult to print anything in Wells library when it's busy, because to send stuff to the printer I have to find a desktop computer, and they're often all taken. I think I tried to set up whatever plug-in sends it remotely from my laptop, but wasn't able to get it to work. It would be nice to have computers that are reserved for sending stuff to the print queue in the printing stations themselves, that aren't for staying on for other work.  I have not had to talk to UITS staff for a while, but I do remember that when I did, they were very helpful, friendly, and quick-thinking to guide me through my problem.  One thing that has caused me problems in the past and that I am worried about in the upcoming future are the changes to the email system. There was a switch last semester, and I was unable to access my email account from a browser for a long time. Luckily, I have an Outlook app on my computer so I found that I was able to access it there, but it was an abrupt change. Similarly, I am apprehensive for the email system switch that is coming up soon.  I have had rapid and helpful responses when I had technical problems. When I was unable to connect to our lab's microscopy server, a staff member took a lot of time to help me resolve the problem.  I'm not sure that y'all are providing sufficient training to faculty and staff. I have a 500 level class in which the prof seems to have been given little to no training on Canvas.  My experience is so far good.  Generally, my experiences with UITS have been positive. The only area for improvement was that I had to call back within minutes for the same issue because the first agent I spoke with offered the \"easy\" solution; however, the easy solution did not allow for full functionality of the system.  UITS helped me get into my email when I locked myself out. But when I had trouble grading on Canvas, they told me that it was a problem with the software, and they couldn't help me.  I've had very positive experiences with the UITS staff. Timely, understanding, helpful, and— importantly—they make genuine attempts to explain the problem in a way that I can understand with my non-technical mind!  Most of the staff has been very patient and friendly.  The experience was good. The response was prompt and up to the mark. It helped me.  I contacted the UITS on an issue regarding accessing the Google scholar proxy provided by UITS. The response was total shambles. The person initially didn't accept there is an issue, without trying to reproduce it. Later he said that he cannot reproduce, while the SiceHelp and many of my colleagues experienced the same issue. The person who handled the issue only gave me some random and trivial instructions like remove cache and use incognito etc. Finally, the IT support of the library informed us that they had troubles with the proxy and alternatives to download the papers. The UITS support is a waste of time, and they even failed to route me to the correct people who handle the service.  I conclude UITS support line is a total waste of money and time when it comes to getting support for any issue beyond \"downloading a meme,\" and the people employed by them are not at all competent to handle anything beyond that. I recommend you train your people in the support line to be aware of the existing system issues and handle them with respect and propagate to the next level if they are not competent to handle it without sending random answers like the Google chrome support page, rather than wasting time and students' technology fees on brash and useless newsletters. (I have worked as a SE in a software company, and I am perfectly aware how to handle a support ticket, and what I received is a below-par rated service from you.)  I have found the staff extremely helpful. I have needed help with various software during my program.  N/A  Overall, I have been very pleased with the UITS team for their help and support through this forced Covid-19 transition. I've been particularly pleased with the customer service help that they offered when I was temporarily locked out of my account. I hadn't had occasion to use the direct customer service feature before, and it was wonderful.  I had a pleasant and efficient experience with UITS staff. The representative guided me through a simple Zoom log-in process clearly and politely, without making me feel ridiculous for having difficulties with navigation. Thank you!  It would be nice to not have to use Duo login every time I log in on my personal devices.  NO, the services are great.  No. I am satisfied with the service.  I like how we have access to any services through IUanyware. But it is confusing when there are multiple merges to different platforms (e.g., from Box to OneDrive).  I wish that IU technology wouldn't change mid semester, as there are often significant kinks to be worked out and cause hardships for those who utilize the software and technology.  So far all my experiences with UITS services have been positive. Compared to other institutions, the UITS services are hassle-free and easy to use.  --I understand the purpose of the Duo login, but it does get annoying.  --Printing (both from my IU office computer and using IU mobile print) has been very unreliable.  --Student services portal (bursar, schedule, etc) is somewhat convoluted, but still manageable  --Kaltura takes some getting used to. Some functions are still not very clear to me.  --COVID testing portal works well!  i’ve only worked with IT services in person, and they were able to help. Maybe expanding online requests because one time i did that and had to wait a ~week for them to help, and in the meantime i fixed it after a few tries.  IUAnyWare is a horrible solution to the need to disseminate software. I'm not sure whether the issue is ultimately Citrix or something else, but as a researcher, if software is only available on IUAnyWare, I might as well not have it. The fact that it is SO SLOW and it times out makes it unusable.  I think you guys are the best. I do not have any issues or concerns.  I have greatly appreciated the live IT services (virtual and on the phone). They have helped me with all technical issues that I have had.  One recommendation is for IT to offer tutorials of Canvas and other important apps for fully online students. I was left to explore one.IU on my own when I first enrolled, and I had no idea where to find my classes, where to sign up for classes, etc.  I like the IUware. Just want to have more downloadable software since the COVID still traps a lot of people at home.  Stop changing email servers, especially during the semester. The disruption of the main form of communication while students are all learning via online learning only makes the learning process hard and creates resentment toward UITS among the students. I have not had any positive experiences, and I have not heard of other students having any positive experiences.  Please offer comprehensive and required Canvas and Zoom training for undergrads at the start of the school year, especially as part of freshman orientation. Teaching staff cannot act as IT staff, not should they be the midpoint between IT and students. IT needs to engage directly with students and have initiative here.  Why can't we just use Google Mail? This new mail server is the worst! This is what happens when Microsuck products are utilized. It constantly tells me that I have new mail, and usually I do not. It's so cumbersome to have to click extra to see messages - they don't always show up in previews.  I have not had issues with UITS, but I feel as tho all my data is secure. I really like the DUO feature, but I’m not sure what I would do if I lost my phone and needed to log in to my IU account.  Printing was a problem about 2 years ago, but I have not had to use it lately.  The amount of resources are a bit overwhelming sometimes, and I forget that we have them. IUCAT is confusing for me still, and I have a difficult time accessing journals or articles sometimes.  UITS was able to help me get into my Outlook account when I wasn't able to myself.  I learned of some of the services that UITS provides only through the survey but I'm extremely excited to explore them at some point. As to my initial comment, I've always found the responsiveness for any sort of support super nimble and helpful - I called and was received help setting up my Duo over the phone ON CHRISTMAS DAY. I turned into an instant patron, and I strongly recommend keeping support consistent.  As to suggestions on change, UITS should market the presence and availability of some of the resources to students via email and other reach out events.  Everything has been great. All services provided have a very easy to interact interface and user friendly platform.  I like the services from IT, especially that of Excel. I would recommend that we could have Tableau training.  Everything has been okay with IT services.  The UITS staff member that I worked with over the phone was incredibly patient and helpful. Even though we were unable to fix the problem over the phone, he was very patient and worked to try all the options that he could think of using without having my computer right in front of him.  Helping us working the high-tech machines in IU. I recommend having more seminars related to the supercomputers and computational skills.  Please make DUO more effective. A \"remember device\" option would be great for at least a period of time. But more importantly, make it so I do not have to do it every time I open any new window. I cannot open Canvas and G-mail within 5 minutes of each other on the same machine without having to go through DUO. It makes the entire school process feel like much more of a chore then it should.  Otherwise I am very happy with our technology.  As a instructor it can be unintuitive about how to find the number I need to call for support if I have problems with the classroom projector, for instance.  No  I always get immediate response from the technicians.  IU Box was way more effective and usable than OneDrive.  I have to admit I haven't had many interactions with UITS. Off of the top of my head I can't think of any! I've been pretty isolated from the majority of the University due to covid. As well as, being a Computer Science major, I can figure out technology pretty easily, so that probably lessens the interactions I would need with UITS.  One thing I guess I can comment on is that I'm a bit upset as a graduate student I am forced to use Outlook mail. I'd prefer to use Gmail.  UITS has always been extremely helpful whenever I've had issues. I think I've mostly interacted with them via the chat and/or e-mail options, but each time the people have provided efficient solutions/help.  UITS was very very fast with fixing issues with my computers at phd station.  It would be nice though, since we are all now on remote, if it had a more advanced online support system.  It seems like some of the software licenses have changed or will change. If that’s true, more transparency around that would be helpful.  Also, for Research Desktop users, a quick “how-to” for Linux would be helpful. Things like file directory, getting programs to look/act like Windows, etc.  Finally, could you please create a way to map OneDrive to Research Desktop like Box was.  No concerns or issues; positive interactions (infrequent).  I attended the supercomputing seminar, and I got to know how to send my code to Carbonate. I think that seminar was a good opportunity to get started.  UITS staff has helped with my computer login problems; they have done a lot for me. It's a shame that the IU wireless network can be difficult to log into. There is also the issue of Jordan library being closed for a good chunk of the last two semesters, meaning that the printing was solely based on one set of computers.  As a virtual student, online classes have been made surprisingly easy to navigate through these technology systems.  Get rid of Exchange.  All the services provided by UITS have made online learning a lot easier than I thought.   "
