What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Indianapolis is a city of charm. It has distinct seasons and multifarious seasonal activities that my husband and I enjoy. In spring, we enjoy walking in downtown and on campus while appreciating amazingly beautiful flowers. The tranquil walk along the canal in summer always brings us the refreshing breeze and joyful moments. Picnics at Broad Ripple and watching the Indy 500 Festival Parade also remind us the fun of life. In fall, we usually visit the Indianapolis Museum of Art to enjoy the world-class art pieces and the pleasant park-view. The snowy Lily House in winter is breathtaking as well. In general, Indianapolis is definitely one of the most livable and unforgettable places around the world.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  Built on my passion for the welfare of women, children, and families, my primary research interest centers around the work-family interface issues. My current focus is on caregivers’ work-family conflict and the structural solutions. Specifically, my dissertation addresses parents’ work-family conflict and gender equality. There are three research projects related to my dissertation: First of all, I have developed an integrated theoretical framework for parents’ work-family conflict. In addition, I have analyzed work-family policies across OECD countries and have created a new typology of policy regimes, and, finally, I have been conducting a systematic review of immigrants’ experiences of work-family conflict in the U.S. My research aims to reduce parents’ work-family conflict, promote gender equality, and enhance the well-being of families, organizations, and the society as a whole through developing a more transformative understanding of work-family interactions and macro-level interventions.  I also have other multiple collaborative research experiences. For instance, I have experience of collaborating with professors and colleagues to develop and validate the Generalist Practice Skills Inventory (GPSI) that measures social work students’ core generalist competencies as well as to examine factors affecting older adults’ civic engagement. These projects have led to multiple presentations at national conferences and the development of manuscripts.  In addition to conducting research, I am currently teaching one online MSW course. Meanwhile, I am partaking in the Culturally Responsive Teaching (CRT) Learning Community serial workshops organized by IUPUI Center for Teaching and Learning. In these workshops, I critically reflect and engage issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the classroom to advance my competence in implementing culturally responsive pedagogy in my teaching. I am also a reviewer for an academic journal in the field of social work. "

Having one of the lowest costs of living in the United States, Indianapolis provides graduate students a good opportunity to begin their financially independent lives.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  Upon completing a bachelor’s degree in Microbiology and a master’s degree in Biochemistry, I developed an appreciation towards the many fascinating theories of the sciences, particularly the intricacies of the metabolism-associated diseases. To satisfy my curiosity, I started to learn more about the disease biology by working in an academic laboratory focused on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in India. I realized the vast potential in this field, considering there are no FDA approved therapies to date and that it has a significant amount of healthcare resource utilization around the world. I was thus motivated to pursue research in this domain and set sights on becoming a biomedical research scientist. While navigating my applications to graduate schools in the United States, I came across the Indiana Biomedical Gateway (IBMG) program at Indiana University School of Medicine. My interactions with the Graduate Program Directors - Tara Hobson and Brandy Wood - allowed me to easily explore what the school had to offer, although I was on a different continent. The opportunity to rotate and engage with leading professors across different departments made me realize that this school fosters an environment of continuous learning and support. I found pioneers in the field of metabolism associated diseases and came across the Center for Diabetes and Metabolic Diseases (CDMD), which is one of the 18 NIH-designated research centers in the United States. I indicated my interests to rotate with and have the possibility of joining the labs among three such mentors at Indiana University School of Medicine. Thereafter, I joined the laboratory of Dr. Xiaocheng Charlie Dong, a renowned figure in the field of metabolism and liver diseases.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  As a budding biomedical scientist in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, I could utilize the supporting network of the amazing faculty members, lab members and my mentor to develop my scientific knowledge and frame research questions keeping in mind the responsible conduct of research. I have been fortunate to be a part of this collaborative environment that has allowed me to publish seven peer-reviewed articles in leading international journals. Moreover, the support and honor that I have received from Indiana University in terms of being awarded the IUPUI Travel Fellowship Award and the IUSM Graduate Student Travel Grant to present my research at the Experimental Biology Conference in Philadelphia, April 2022 has been a humbling experience. I am also indebted to the judges of the 7th Annual Diabetes Symposium, organized by the Center for Diabetes and Metabolic Diseases for awarding me with the Graduate Student Excellence in Research Award in 2021.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  I appreciate the simple, yet vibrant life that Indianapolis has to offer. Having one of the lowest costs of living in the United States, Indianapolis provides graduate students a good opportunity to begin their financially independent lives. Being at the “Crossroads of America,” Indianapolis is located perfectly for driving to destinations in and around the state like Chicago, the Smokey Mountains or exploring the natural beauty of Michigan. I have also been a fan of the Indy 500 which is one of the Triple Crowns of Motorsports. One of the highlights of my time here was to travel to South Bend to watch my favorite team Liverpool F.C. play against Borussia Dortmund at the University of Notre Dame Stadium! Moreover, I have made the best of friends and lifelong connections here in this city during my graduate school life that I will cherish for years to come.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  As a first generation student in my family to pursue a Ph.D from the United States, I feel a great sense of responsibility and purpose to drive my research goals. I am currently conducting research at the forefront of liver biology in the context of Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and hepatic fibrosis. Hepatic fibrosis is a repair mechanism that is initiated upon tissue injury, mediated primarily by hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Activated HSCs deposit excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) components such as collagen in a highly dynamic process. Although progress has been made in understanding the pathobiology of fibrosis, there remains a translational void in the development of antifibrotic therapies to prevent the progress to end-stage liver diseases. My project comes in to address and identify potential druggable targets that regulate the progression of fibrogenesis and prevent the advancement to terminal stages. Through my independent efforts, I identified Sirtuin 6 as a key molecule that regulates fibrogenesis by modulating the Hippo signaling cascade and gained hands-on experience on diverse techniques like small animal surgery, biochemical assays like immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting and molecular biology techniques like cloning, RNA isolation and quantitative PCRs. Outside the lab, I have served as a representative of the School of Medicine in the Academic Affairs sub-committee of the Graduate and Professional Student Government (GPSG). Also, I was one of the founding members of the Biomedical Graduate Student Advocacy Association (BGSAA). One of the highlighting aspects was a collaboration with a student organization in Germany to host a mental-health webinar during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic for the distressed students in need. I am indebted to the Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) professionals on campus to have been a part of this initiative and delivered a webinar called “The 8-dimensions of Wellness.” "

    "body": "  # Igor  Ogashawara   ### Ph.D. in Applied Earth Sciences  I would definitely encourage prospective graduate students to visit the facilities, to personally talk to their prospective advisor and understand what the graduate program can offer.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I chose my graduate school at IUPUI after visiting the campus and the Department of Earth Science in July of 2013. I visited the campus while I was traveling around the country to specifically talk to, Dr. Lin Li, who was one of my references in my Master Thesis. Dr. Li was very welcoming and I could learn about his research and about the graduate program of the department. What called my attention was the opportunity to work in an interdisciplinary research combining experts from different scientific fields to study the same problem: harmful algal blooms. In addition to this research opportunity, the idea of having a minor degree in Environmental Health Sciences to add a community benefit perspective in the research was also an important factor for me to choose IUPUI. I would definitely encourage prospective graduate students to visit the facilities, to personally talk to their prospective advisor and understand what the graduate program can offer.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  My favorite experiences during my graduate school journey have been the opportunity to attend important scientific events. During these almost three years in the Ph.D program I was able to attend the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO) Aquatic Sciences Meeting (in 2015 and 2017) as well as the Association of American Geographers (AAG) Annual Meeting (2015). The attendance to these scientific events helped me to not only to showcase the work that I have been conducting here at IUPUI, but also to get good feedback about my research, having brainstorm conversations about future work, meet many of the researchers that I only knew from reading their papers as well as increase my network. These opportunities were not only supported by the department and by my advisor but also by different travel grants that we, as graduate students, can apply for like the Graduate Office Travel Grant.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  What I like in Indianapolis is its size. It is not a huge metropolitan area with urban problems but it is also not a small sized city where everything is far away from you. Indianapolis has the perfect size to fulfill all the needs of a graduate student, it has good places to eat, good cultural attractions, is always hosting important sport events and you can walk from the main campus to downtown in just few minutes. I also like the climate, coming from a tropical country (Brazil) I always liked to see the four different seasons in a year.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  My research is focused on monitoring and predicting the occurrence of harmful algal blooms (HABs) from space. Every year there is an increase in the number of occurrence of HABs, especially in water supply and recreational waters. A good example of this issue was the HAB in Lake Erie in the beginning of August of 2014 which resulted in the contamination of the tap water of Toledo, Ohio, affecting over 500,000 people. The use of satellites to monitor these HABs is a new technology that have been intensively developed in the last two decades, mainly because of the development of new sensors and satellites. The use of satellites provide a spatial and temporal coverage of HABs which is not possible when conducting a field sampling. However, there are many challenges to develop a global operational monitoring of HABs using satellites and my research here at IUPUI is trying to work on a framework to use satellites to monitor HABs worldwide. Besides my research, I am a youth science supporter and I am currently the representative for Brazil in the International Conference of Young Scientists (ICYS). ICYS is a little bit different from the science fairs that we have in the U.S., since it is based on oral presentations in front of a specific jury in their research field. Therefore, this initiative is a way to inspire young scientists (High School students) to pursue their path into the science field.

Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  My personal goal is to become a physician-scientist – someone who works to better understand a given disease, and, ideally, translate this understanding into novel treatments for said disease. Between word of mouth, my own research, and meetings with faculty members on campus I learned about a number of fantastic mentors at IUPUI performing great basic science research with a disease-related focus. I forged a great relationship with one of these mentors, worked in his laboratory, and then completed my graduate studies in his lab. It was a great decision and could not have worked out better for me.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  Without a doubt, it would have to be publishing my first paper on my thesis studies. This paper represented the culmination of years of work and training. I was proud to contribute to the small scientific community studying the disease that I also worked on.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Indy is a big city that doesn’t come with the big city feel. We have professional basketball, football, and frequently host Big Ten/NCAA collegiate events. There’s a lot in the way of arts and culture. Our downtown area is growing rapidly – it’s quite amazing to see all the new developments coming each month. We get all this without some the things that may detract from other major cities, including a high cost of living and difficulty travelling throughout the city.

    "body": " To create a new graduate or professional course or revise or discontinue an existing graduate or professional course, faculty members must submit a proposal through the Course Approval, Remonstrance, Maintenance and Integration (CARMIn) system. Here, we’ll guide you in planning and seeking approval for your course.  All University Graduate School and Purdue courses are approved by the curriculum subcommittee of the Graduate Affairs Committee, whereas professional courses do not need curriculum subcommittee approval. Meet the curriculum subcommittee.  Any questions about getting courses through the approval process, please contact Dezra Despain, dezdes@iupui.edu , 317-278-4326   #### 2022-2023 Committee Dates  To ensure courses are reviewed by the curriculum subcommittee on the 1st of the month, the CARMIn form must be received in the IU Graduate School Indianapolis by the 30th of the previous month.  September 1 October 1 November 1 December CANCELED January 1 February 1 March 1 April 1 May 1 June - August - recess   ## Designing Your Course  When designing your course, think carefully about the items called for in the proposal form:  When approving, the committee will carefully consider matters such as the nature, depth, and scope of the materials treated in each proposal.  Graduate-level courses should be more demanding, sophisticated, and rigorous than undergraduates courses.  A proper graduate course will emphasize theoretical, conceptual, methodological (as contrasted with technical), or systematic treatments of material, rather than factual data. It should deal directly with the research content of the field and with the discipline’s research methodologies.  In proposing a new course, consider the following:   ## New Course and Course Change Requirements  New Course Requirements  The curriculum committee will not approve new courses if the following requirements are not met:  Course Change Requirements  The committee will review course change requests to verify that the changes do not constitute a new course, and to maintain academic consistency across campus.  A syllabus is not required for course change requests.   ## New Course Syllabus Requirements  An accompanying syllabus is required for all new courses and it must include the following before the committee will approve the course:  IUPUI Policies - sample language for syllabi  Graduate level grading scale  To earn a degree from the IU Graduate School, students must have at least a 3.0 graduate GPA. For this reason, several IU graduate programs do not accept any grade below a B. A grading scale in the syllabus that includes C- and below is not considered a graduate-level grading scale and will require clarification.  Example of an IU Graduate Grading Scale  Purdue Graduate School requires that the total number of hours of academic credit used to satisfy degree requirements consists of all graduate course credit hours with a grade of C- or better, therefore including a grading scale below a C- in the syllabus is not considered a graduate-level grading scale and will require clarification.  Example of a Purdue Graduate Grading Scale  Download a sample syllabus that includes the IUPUI policies   ## Course Design Resources   ### Getting Your Course Approved   ## CARMIn - The Course Approval System  IUPUI’s Course Approval, Remonstrance, Maintenance, and Integration (CARMIn) system allows faculty members to submit these proposals electronically. The Course Approval System instructions explain how faculty members can submit a request and how administrators can approve a request.  Download the Course Approval System instructions.  [Course Approval System instructions.](https://ittraining.iu.edu/sis/sis-job-aids/student-records/edocs/course-approval-remonstrance/CARMiN_Initiator_job_aid.pdf)  Browser Type. The recommended browser for the CARMIn system is Firefox. Internet Explorer may also be used in Compatability mode. Currently, the drop-down values do not always display when using Google Chrome.  To use CARMin to submit a request, do the following:  [one.iu.edu](https://one.iu.edu/)  After you’ve submitted your proposal and the request has received initial approval, the proposal will be placed on the CARMIn remonstrance list for 30 days.  To use CARMin to view the remonstrance list, do the following:  [one.iu.edu](https://one.iu.edu/)  Administrators may also use the system to approve requests.     ## Curriculum Subcommittee Review  The curriculum subcommittee reviews all graduate courses. Professional courses are not reviewed by the committee.  The review process for the committee begins the first working day of the month. In order to ensure a new course / course change request is on the committee's agenda, the CARMIn form must be recieved in the IU Graduate School Indianapolis no later than the 30th of the previous month (with the exception of February). Any courses received after the 30th will be held until the following month. "

Please visit Membership to Graduate Faculty to learn more about the Indianapolis nomination process for obtaining graduate faculty status and the endorsement. Contact our office in Indianapolis at gradoff@iupui.edu to learn if an individual has been appointed with limited graduate faculty status. A pdf document with a list of IU faculty with graduate faculty status and the endorsement is posted on our Membership to Graduate Faculty webpage.  Limited Status – Limited status can be used for committee appointments under several circumstances. Affiliate and non-tenure track IU faculty including clinicians, scientists and fellows can be recommended for this status. Limited status can also be used for the appointment of an off-campus individual who is expert in the student’s training area but who does not hold an IU appointment. A school or department is responsible for nominating individuals for graduate faculty limited status, typically following a vote of approval for the nomination by the school or department faculty. Individuals with limited status can contribute at student research meetings, mentoring students, and offering recommendations on students’ progress with this status. If the student committee members overall agree, limited status faculty may vote electronically on student progression. If a research committee member leaves IU in good standing for any reason other than retirement and wishes to remain on a committee until the student graduates, a school must submit a request for limited graduate faculty status. These requests must include the student’s name and university ID. Contact us at gradoff@iupui.edu to check if an individual has been approved for limited graduate faculty status on campus or to notify us that a faculty member is leaving the institution. Once approved for limited graduate faculty status, individual appointments can be updated with new student committee service by contacting gradoff@iupui.edu . Some limited status external committee experts (sometimes referred to as outside members) do not have access to the electronic voting system for approving/disapproving student progression and grades. These committee members can contribute to meetings, offer input on student progression at committee meetings, and help mentor students. Also, these individuals would typically be considered a 5th member, not one of the minimum four requirement.  Each committee must have a faculty member serving as the representative for the minor (minor rep). The minor representative should be an IU faculty member or external expert with knowledge in the minor field. The term outside member is sometimes used to refer to the minor representative. However, the term outside can refer to a faculty member from another IU department or school, or an individual from another institution or business outside IU.  Emeritus faculty may continue to serve on the student committee on which they held membership prior to retirement. These faculty cannot serve as the committee chair but can hold the position of co-chair. This situation does not require a request for limited status, however, if the faculty member was serving as chair, a nomination of research change form/eDoc is required along with the appointment of a new chair or co-chair.  Requests for full or limited graduate faculty status, as well as the endorsement of graduate faculty, should be sent to the Graduate School Indianapolis via the Graduate Faculty/Limited Status Request form on our Membership to Graduate Faculty webpage. Requests must include a CV or resume for the faculty member being nominated. The Graduate School in Indianapolis keeps a list of individuals approved for limited status, while a list of emeritus faculty, full graduate faculty and those with the endorsement is published on our Membership to Graduate Faculty webpage.

Downtown is expanding and development is occurring everywhere. Being surrounded by this progress and development is inspiring.   #### Alumnus  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  Growing up in Indianapolis, I had a desire to direct my career path to the city. So when I made law my focus, I knew I wanted to go to a law school that would set me up for a career in Indianapolis. With its proximity to the heart of downtown and wealth of internship and externship opportunities, McKinney was an easy choice. McKinney has been a great experience for me. I have been presented with many opportunities to network with the amazing Indiana legal community as well as chances to engage directly with city and county agencies.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  My favorite academic accomplishment has been the work that I have been able to do to expand Indiana’s commitment to reintegration. Ex-offenders are presented with a long and difficult road to re-entry and too often are left to face this journey alone. To assist these individuals, Professor Lahny Silva leads the Re-Entry and Community Help (“REACH”) program. The REACH program is designed to assist qualified supervisees in their transition back into the Indianapolis community with the goal of reducing the number of formerly incarcerated individuals who fail to successfully reintegrate. I was fortunate enough to have been selected for this program and through it I have been able to work with Federal judges and officers as well as use my legal education to help others.  Further, a group of McKinney students and I created the Second Chance Re-Entry Program (“SCRAP”) to bring the goals of REACH to the greater student body. All are welcome to join SCRAP and I hope to help take this new organization and us it to make an impact on the Indianapolis community.  My work in both REACH and SCRAP have been some of the most fulfilling experiences in my academic career.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  There seems to be a feeling of growth around Indianapolis, and it is amazing to be a part of it. Downtown is expanding and development is occurring everywhere. Being surrounded by this progress and development is inspiring. It is fun to see where Indianapolis is headed and being downtown makes for a great view.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  During my first year in law school, I worked as an Intern at the Marion County Prosecutors Office. I also worked as a Summer Associate at Faegre Baker Daniels last summer, and I will be returning there this summer.  Along with REACH and SCRAP, I am the Scholarship Chair of the Black Law Student Association, Executive Managing Editor of the Indiana Law Review, and a member of the Deans Tutorial Society. "

I enjoy living in a city with several events and places to visit, and it is also easy to get away from the city to go hiking.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  While working at IU Health as a Registered Nurse, I earned my Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) from Indiana University School of Nursing IUPUI in 2013. I was very fortunate to work with, and learn from, some of the best clinical nurse specialists in the nation. When I decided to return to school to work on my PhD, IUPUI was my top choice. I was looking for a school where I could collaborate with experts in health services research and obtain valuable experience in research and policy.  I am interested in the adoption and implementation of evidence-based interventions to improve patient outcomes. In other words, I want healthcare providers and policy-makers to have good data and information so they can make decisions that will improve the quality of care for patients. My mentors within the IU School of Nursing IUPUI and Fairbanks School of Public Health are leaders in health services research and health policy, and the opportunity to work alongside them will prepare me to conduct research to transform the way we provide healthcare.  In addition to knowledge gained in the classroom setting, there are several opportunities at IUPUI to expand my knowledge and skills outside of the classroom. As a research assistant with Dr. Robin Newhouse, I have contributed to several aspects of a multi-site study including grant writing, development of an intervention, data collection, data analysis, and dissemination of our results. As a legislative fellow under the guidance of Representative Ed Clere and Dr. Sharron Crowder, I have first-hand experience regarding the state legislative process and the link between research and policy.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  There are two academic accomplishments that have been especially meaningful for me. First, I was selected for the Robert Wood Johnson Future of Nursing Scholars program. This program aims to develop PhD-prepared nurses for leadership in practice, education, and healthcare transformation. Second, I was selected to be part of the Elite 50, a recognition of graduate and professional students who are involved in campus leadership, community engagement, and scholarly work. I am honored to work alongside nurse scholars who are transforming healthcare nationally and graduate students who are contributing to the university and community.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Indianapolis is a great place to work and live. I enjoy living in a city with several events and places to visit, and it is also easy to get away from the city to go hiking. My favorite places in Indy are Newfields and Eagle Creek Park.

Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I was motivated to pursue a research and academic career focused on medically underserved populations, specifically immigrants and racial/ethnic minorities. Additionally, it was critical for me to train with someone with expertise in chronic illnesses prevalent in racial/ethnic minority communities, specifically cardiometabolic conditions, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. For these reasons I decided to further my career by pursuing a PhD in Clinical Psychology at IUPUI to work under the mentorship of Dr. Jesse Stewart in his Cardiometabolic Behavioral Medicine (CBM) Lab.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  In July of 2017 I was awarded the Indiana CTSI Predoctoral Fellowship to protect time for dissertation work and advanced training in clinical and translational science. The opportunities offered to me by the fellowship have been integral to my professional and academic development and I am grateful for the support.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  “Midwest nice” is a thing. Small businesses support small businesses, community meet-ups and clean-ups are common, and if you offer enough pizza, there is someone out there with a pickup truck ready to help you move.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  Research is fundamental in the effort to achieve health equity, as research shapes our shared understanding of the causes and consequences of health disparities. To this end, my emerging program of research seeks to understand how patient, provider, and system factors determine and perpetuate disparities in medical care and outcomes for racial/ethnic minorities and immigrants. I use both epidemiological data and experimental designs to explore these questions along the healthcare continuum, from more proximal, individual-level factors (e.g., physician bias in medical decision-making) to more distal, socio-environmental factors (e.g., the relationship between experiences of discrimination and incident disease). The ultimate goal of my research is to inform, develop, and test evidence-based interventions targeting these multi-level factors to reduce, and ideally eliminate, the mechanisms maintaining the disparities that lead to health inequities for vulnerable populations.

    "body": " IUPUI offers over 250 graduate degrees to students interested in pursuing a Ph.D., a professional degree, a master's degree, or a graduate certificate. Several of these degrees are not offered by any other public institution in the state.  In addition, current IUPUI undergraduates have the opportunity to explore many different accelerated bachelor’s to master’s degree programs . Accelerated bachelor’s to master’s degree programs allow ambitious IUPUI undergraduate students the opportunity to earn both a bachelor’s degree AND a master’s degree in a shorter time frame than if pursued independent of each other (i.e., 5 years vs. 6 years).  IUPUI confers both Indiana University and Purdue University graduate degrees.   ### IUPUI Graduate & Professional Programs by School   ## Herron School of Art & Design  [MA](https://herron.iupui.edu/academics/gdegrees/art-therapy/index.html)  [GRD-CERT](https://herron.iupui.edu/academics/minors-certificates/design-thinking-certificate.html)  [MFA](https://herron.iupui.edu/academics/gdegrees/visual-art/index.html)  [MDes](https://herron.iupui.edu/academics/gdegrees/master-of-design/index.html)   ## Kelley School of Business  [MSA,](https://kelley.iupui.edu/programs/graduate-accounting/)  [MBA](https://kelley.iupui.edu/programs/evening-mba/index.html)  [MST](https://kelley.iupui.edu/programs/graduate-accounting/)  [MBA](https://kelley.iupui.edu/programs/evening-mba/)  [MBA](https://kelley.iupui.edu/programs/evening-mba/academics/majors.html#entrepreneurship)  [MBA](https://kelley.iupui.edu/programs/evening-mba/academics/majors.html#finance)  [MBA](https://kelley.iupui.edu/programs/evening-mba/academics/majors.html#marketing)  [GRD-CERT](https://kelley.iupui.edu/programs/evening-mba/academics/medical-management-certificate/index.html)  [MBA](https://kelley.iupui.edu/programs/evening-mba/academics/majors.html#supplychain)   ## Lilly Family School of Philanthropy  [PhilD](https://philanthropy.iupui.edu/academics/phild/index.html)  [GRD-CERT*](https://philanthropy.iupui.edu/academics/graduate-certificate/index.html)  [MA*](https://philanthropy.iupui.edu/academics/ma/index.html)  [PhD*](https://philanthropy.iupui.edu/academics/phd/index.html)   ## Luddy School of Informatics, Computing & Engineering  [MS](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/data-science/data-science-masters/)  [GRD-CERT](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/certificates/archive-management.html)  [MS](https://soic.iupui.edu/biohealth/graduate/bioinformatics/masters/)  [PhD*](https://luddy.iupui.edu/biohealth/graduate/bioinformatics/phd/)  [GRD-CERT](https://luddy.iupui.edu/biohealth/graduate/health-informatics/biomedical-certificate/)  [GRD-CERT](https://luddy.iupui.edu/biohealth/graduate/health-informatics/clinical-informatics/)  [MS](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/masters/computer-science/)  [PhD*](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/phd/computer-science/)  [PhD*](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/data-science/data-science-phd/)  [MS](https://luddy.iupui.edu/biohealth/graduate/health-informatics/masters/)  [PhD*](https://luddy.iupui.edu/biohealth/graduate/health-informatics/phd/)  [GRD-CERT](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/certificates/health-information-security.html)  [GRD-CERT](https://luddy.iupui.edu/biohealth/graduate/health-informatics/health-information-systems/)  [GRD-CERT](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/certificates/hci-grad.html)  [MS](https://luddy.iupui.edu/hcc/graduate/hci/masters/)  [PhD*](https://luddy.iupui.edu/hcc/graduate/hci/phd/)  [MLS](https://luddy.iupui.edu/lis/master-library-science/)  [GRD CERT](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/certificates/precision-medicine.html)  [GRD-CERT](https://luddy.iupui.edu/degrees/certificates/school-library.html)   ## Paul H.

    "body": "  # Connor  Norwood   ### Ph.D. in Health Policy and Management - Alumnus  Through my coursework, I was able to get involved with the Indiana Prescription Drug Abuse and Prevention Task Force, as well as provide expert testimony to both the State House of Representatives and State Senate.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  The Department of Health Policy and Management (HPM) prepares students to cultivate skills regarding health policy development and healthcare organizational management. As a part of the curriculum, students study the historical, political and economic contexts of policy development. Also, the IU Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health is strategically located in the heart of Indianapolis, only a couple of blocks from the State’s Capitol. This allows students to not only study the theoretical components of health policy development, but also allows students to gain practical experience with the policy process. In fact, through my coursework in the PhD program I was able to get involved with the Indiana Prescription Drug Abuse and Prevention Task Force, provide expert testimony to both the State House of Representatives and State Senate.  This experience resulted in students sharing our experience at a national conference and publishing our work in the Journal of Addictions Nursing.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  In 2013, Indiana was among seven states, identified as having a commitment to advancing health workforce initiatives that participated in a policy academy with the National Governors Association Center for Best Practices (NGA Center). While at IUPUI and through work with the Bowen Center for Health Workforce Research and Policy at the IU School of Medicine, I was able to work with the NGA Center and Governor’s office on the policy academy which was titled, “Building a Transformed Healthcare Workforce: Moving from Planning to Implementation”. Just recently this work culminated in the creation of a Governor’s Health Workforce Council that will help develop data-driven health workforce policies for the State of Indiana. My experience on this project and through my coursework in the Department of Health Policy and Management has opened doors for me to continue collaboration with the NGA Center on future technical assistance programs.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Indianapolis is truly the “Crossroads of America”, which actually provides significant travel opportunities for graduate students. The Indianapolis International Airport is quick and easy to get in and out of which lends graduate students the opportunity to find cheap flights to regional and national conferences. Partly due to the ease of travel out of Indianapolis, I have been able to attend several national conferences including the American Public Health Association’s Annual Meetings, AcademyHealth’s Annual Research Meeting, and the Association of American Medical Colleges Health Workforce Research Conference.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  The U.S. health system is undergoing massive transformations. It is moving from a “sick care” system focused on diagnosis and treatment to a system that “cares for health” and is focused on disease prevention and health promotion. This shift has significant implications for the healthcare delivery system and its workforce. The U.S. health system must ensure the health workforce has the capacity to meet a growing demand for health care services; however a current shortage of primary care providers threatens access to care. Currently, the system is in need of an additional 17,722 primary care providers to meet the present demand for health services. One approach to reducing the burden of the primary care shortage is to fully leverage the expertise and training of non-physician providers, such as nurse practitioners (NPs). NPs are regulated through state level professional practice acts which delineate the clinical tasks permitted and the level of professional independence provided to these health professionals. Although NPs are trained to national level academic standards variations in these professional practice regulations have been shown to influence health care delivery.  I am currently working on my dissertation which is tentatively titled, “Nurse Practitioner Practice Characteristics and Patient Care Patterns: Understanding the Role of State Professional Practice Environment”. The dissertation examines the impact of state professional practice regulations on nurse practitioner provided care and will significantly contribute to our understanding of how state policy environments impact access to health care, health care delivery and health outcomes.

At my program interview, I learned of the collaboration between Dr. Goodlett (Psychology) and Dr. Roper (Biology) that studied various deficits in a mouse model of Down Syndrome. After my visit, I knew IUPUI was the one!  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  I would have to say completing my masters in the Fall of 2015. It involved learning a lot of new techniques and it took a lot of perseverance and staring into a microscope, but that’s what made it so sweet.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  I come from a small town (population 1,000), so I really enjoy the friendly atmosphere that Indianapolis brings. But, it is a big enough city that there’s plenty to do. I love to run along the canal, play ultimate Frisbee in Military Park, watch the Indians play, and chow down on a burger at Bru Burger on Mass Ave.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  We administer various potential preclinical treatments to a mouse model of Down Syndrome to try and improve the various deficits that are seen in DS. The mouse model we use is a good model because it displays many of the cognitive and skeletal deficits that are seen in DS. I am primarily responsible for managing all the behavioral tasks, as well as the histological analysis. I am also a teaching assistant for various courses and I volunteer for Down Syndrome Indiana (DSI). "

Today I work with renowned faculty who are supportive and available to me, and I enjoy a supportive relationship with my fellow students.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I was accepted at several excellent universities and I visited them all. It was important to me that there was a good fit, much like choosing a new job. We were planning to relocate anyway, so I took the time to make sure I would not only receive an excellent education, but the environment was also a good fit.

Today I work with renowned faculty who are supportive and available to me, and I enjoy a supportive relationship with my fellow students.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  I’ve really enjoyed the diversity in my academic program. In addition to many courses in research methods, health policy and management, I’ve been able to take additional courses in areas of my specific interests. The experience has really opened my eyes to different aspects of healthcare and different perspectives.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Indianapolis feels like a “small big city” to me. We can find everything we need or want in the Indianapolis area, and yet we are minutes away from great hiking and camping, when we want to get out of the city. It’s also very easy to get around, which I can’t say about every city we’ve lived in. We love living in the Midwest.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  I’ve had many opportunities to work with faculty on a wide variety of research projects, and I’ve learned a great deal from each experience. I am currently working with Joshua R. Vest PhD MPH, to apply for a grant and establish a multi-university research center that is a partnership between academia and industry. I have also been involved with research related to pain clinic closures, concussion prevention and treatment, file matching within health information exchanges, and I’m currently doing some work with a faculty member who is also the editor-in-chief of a national journal and on the board of a national society. I have had the opportunity to teach multiple undergraduate courses and TA for several professors. I also currently serve as the vice president of the local Academy Health student chapter. "

I chose graduate school at IUPUI because of the exceptional faculty members. I was visiting programs in many mid-sized cities in the Midwest because I prefer city-life but wanted to be relatively close to home (Cleveland). When I met Dr. Jennifer Thorington-Springer, I knew IUPUI was the right place for me.

Last year, I earned the Barlow award for an article I wrote on Gayl Jones’s Corregidora, which I was then able to present at the literary conference down in Bloomington.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  I am still getting to know the city, and that’s probably what I enjoy most – happening upon cafes, and restaurants that I had no idea about. The Midwest gets a bad rap for its lack of diversity and culture, but I think we have a lot to offer if you’re willing to look.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  My research interests are in women’s literature of the 20th Century; my thesis examines representations of women’s resistance through the fiction of women authors spanning the 20th C. I am intrigued by the ways that we as women resist debilitation and silence through creation, through art and expression. In a world where you are supposed to be quiet, seen but not heard, or in cases of women of color and third world women neither seen nor heard, perhaps one of the most subversive things you can do is to create, to speak out, to tell stories that would otherwise remain unheard. My teaching interests focus more on writing – basic writing pedagogies specifically. I am interested in students’ transitions from high school to college writing and am fortunate to teach W131 here at IUPUI. Additionally, I assist students in our University Writing Center, participate in the Hoosier Writing Project, and volunteer with our fantastic Undergraduate Admissions department whenever the chance arises.

Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I chose IUPUI over other universities mainly due to my interest in biosensing applications. Under the supervision of Dr. Rajesh Sardar, the University was already working on ground breaking research in “Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR)” based on microRNA sensors using gold nanoprisms.  Another reason is IUPUI’s location. Indianapolis is home to prestigious leading industries related to my studies, including Eli Lilly, Dow, etc., which have sharpened IUPUI’s mission in terms of chemistry. IUPUI has the resources required to work on ground breaking research to lead the world in science, and I wanted to be a part of that.  What’s been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  My favorite academic accomplishment so far has been researching the current method of detecting Cancer MicroRNA, which failed to work directly in biological fluids. Also, the methods were either semi-quantitative or they required amplification. At our lab, we developed highly sensitive, label-free, non-destructive, highly specific methods to detect Cancer MicroRNA based on the LSPR properties of chemically synthesized gold nanoprisms.  This research would help with the early diagnosis of cancer and, hopefully, it would benefit many people in the near future. I am proud to be a part of this academic accomplishment, and it has been my favorite research to be a part of to date.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Indianapolis is a welcoming city with beautiful people. It is highly diverse and offers an incredible international experience. I have attended one of the races at the Indianapolis 500 and have explored the city’s museums, as well as sampled different local and international foods here.  In the summer and fall, every day at 5 a.m., I start my day by running around Indy’s best landscape, which is the downtown canal. And for me, it is heaven on earth. "

Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I’ve been a student at IUPUI for almost a decade! I earned both my bachelor’s and master’s degrees here and I feel very comfortable on campus. It’s almost like a second home to me. I knew earning a Ph.D was going to be a challenge both academically and personally, so I wanted to be surrounded by faculty and peers who I already knew and enjoyed working with. Having that established community for support has helped me to thrive as a graduate student.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  This isn’t necessarily an accomplishment, but I love all the different people I get to work with through research and teaching. Every time I have students and colleagues who stop me in the hallways to say hi or thank me for helping them in the anatomy lab makes me feel really good and validated in the career path that I’ve chosen.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Indianapolis is home for me! I’ve lived here most of my life. Many of my friends and family are still here and I’ve made lots of new connections since becoming a graduate student. I like that it is a mid-sized city but with a hometown feel. I’m constantly running into people I know when I’m out and about.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  I have quite a few research interests. My main interest is anatomical terminology and how students learn the languages of anatomy and medicine. In particular, I’ve been focusing on eponyms – terms named after other people. These terms are often used without any context, and I want to shed some light on them and how useful they may or may not be for communication. It’s a nice blend of historical and educational research. I’m also very interested in public outreach for science, which is why I chose to do a minor in communicating science. As an anatomist I think everyone could benefit from knowing more about the human body and science in general, so all my scholarly pursuits are towards that goal. "

My emerging program of research seeks to better understand: 1) psychosocial factors (e.g., pain-related injustice, coping strategies, and resilience) that influence pain and functioning in children/adolescents with pain, and 2) sociocultural factors that facilitate and impede the delivery of guideline-concordant care for children/adolescents with pain. My first line of research focuses on pain-related injustice perceptions and their relationship to functional outcomes in pediatric pain patients. I am also examining how caregiver factors, such as injustice perceptions and catastrophizing, influence the child’s pain experience. Regarding my second line of research, I am using virtual human patients to examine how provider bias, provider empathy, and pediatric patient and parent characteristics (e.g., race, gender, and SES) individually and interactively affect pain care for pediatric patients.

Indeed, it is a major city with almost all the benefits of a small town.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I chose IUPUI because of two compelling reasons. First, my advisor is one the best in the design optimization field and doing research under his supervision is a marvelous opportunity for me. Second, the Ph.D. degree offered directly by Purdue University as a highly respected school was my other motivation to join IUPUI.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  I have been working on a project funded by General Motors since 2016. Last year, General Motors offered us to continue working on the project, and they extended their financial support due to their great satisfaction.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Indianapolis has most everything that a major city would have. Indeed, it is a major city with almost all the benefits of a small town. The accessibility of the city makes it a place that you can get out and enjoy it multiple times a week. You'll always have great options for American and International cuisine. Finally, if you dig the Midwest mentality, Indy is a great place to hang your hat!  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  From the beginning of my Ph.D. carrier, I had been working on the development of a non-linear topology optimization algorithm. As I said, my research has been financially supported by the largest automotive industry in the United States, General Motors. The overall objective of this research is to develop the optimization methods and computational tools to concurrently optimize the material distribution in the vehicle structure and even any other structural component under dynamic loading. In contrast to linear implicit methods and partially nonlinear implicit methods for topology optimization, my research goal is the development of a truly nonlinear algorithm for multi-material topology optimization.

What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  I enjoy the mix of nature and urban activities within the city. You can run or hike near the river, canal, or in a park. Then you can drive a few minutes down the road and find fun art events, cool places, and all sorts of activities to participate in.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  Broadly, my research is focused on improving the lives of chronic pain patients. One way I do this is by exploring the role of patient factors in chronic pain experiences, including health care. Minority patients with chronic pain often report more symptoms and receive worse care. For this reason, my thesis project explored how beliefs about race differences in pain sensitivity may be related to actual race differences in pain tolerance. I have also explored the impact of patient weight and gender on the likelihood of receiving different recommendations. By understanding the role of patient characteristics, such as race, gender, and weight, future research can develop targeted interventions to improve care and treatments for all chronic pain patients. Additionally, I have recently begun to explore new treatment methods for chronic pain patients in my clinical practice, and I hope to explore these treatments in future research. "

While earning my JD/MSW, I interned at \"Use What You've Got Prison Ministry,\" a local nonprofit that works to keep families connected while a loved one is incarcerated.   #### Alumna  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I grew up in Brownsburg, Indiana and went to IU Bloomington for my undergraduate education. I knew I wanted to be close to home for grad school, but still have the feel of being in a city where change takes place. IUPUI is a great fit for me- I am close to my family while also being near the Statehouse and other government agencies- perfect for a J.D./M.S.W. student interested in using my degrees to serve others and advocate for social justice.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  This year, I organized an event called “A Network Fair for Service Providers.” Approximately 125 service providers from a wide-range of sectors in the community came together to educate each other on the services they provide. Specifically, attendees included agencies that serve children, veterans, and the homeless population, along with government agencies, legal aid agencies, health agencies, and many more. The underlying belief of this event was that clients are better served by systems that appreciate and understand each other; allowing them to make more effective referrals. This Network Fair served as a platform to learn more about the services being provided in the Indianapolis area, increase collaboration, encourage partnerships, and ultimately enhance services to clients.  The event was a great success- Of 40 surveys completed, all 40 either \"agree\" or \"strongly agree\" that they know more about services being provided in the Indianapolis area as a result of this event. All 40 respondents either \"agree\" or \"strongly agree\" that they know how they can collaborate with organizations they met today and 39 out of 40 respondents indicate they will follow-up with at least one organization they met at the Fair.  It was very exciting to be able to see a need in my community, come up with a plan to address that need, and execute an event successfully that worked to alleviate that need.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Life in Indianapolis is never dull! From exploring restaurants and bars on Massachusetts Avenue to attending important events at the Indiana Supreme Court- it has a little bit of something for everyone. Every single weekend there is something to do- whether that be a band at Old National Center, a play at the IRT, a major sporting event, a coffee shop to visit, and so much more. Indianapolis is a great place in which to learn, meet people, and play- absolutely perfect for young professionals.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.

I have seen a wealth of new projects, organizations, and communities come about due to this growth and I believe that Indy will continue this trend and the school will benefit because of it.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I completed both my undergraduate degrees at IUPUI and had a strong relationship with the Earth Sciences faculty and staff. My undergraduate research in the Experimental Geochemistry Lab at IUPUI with Dr. Catherine Macris, my current advisor, also allowed me to transition into graduate school with definite research goals in mind.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  Academically, I feel my greatest accomplishment has been my change of perspective with respect to mathematics. Since high school, I felt disenchanted when learning about or practicing math, but when I saw the potential it held for my academic and professional career, as well as for my outlook on life, I dedicated myself to my studies. I am proud to have earned two Bachelor’s of Science, one from the Purdue School of Engineering and Technology and another from the Indiana University School of Science. I have also recently been made a Graduate Research Fellow of the National Science Foundation in the field of Geosciences - Computationally Intensive Research.

Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  Work/research  My work in The Experimental Geochemistry Lab at IUPUI involves the investigation of rock affected by meteor impacts on Earth’s surface. I primarily investigate these processes through a combination of heating/partial vaporization experiments using an Aerodynamic Levitation Laser Furnace as well as statistically analyzing the chemistry of the products of my experiments. My undergraduate research has grown from a simple, data-entry project into the creation of what is likely the largest database of this type of geologic information in the world. I am proud to be able to say that my initiative on this project has transformed it in such a dramatic way.  Activities/communities/volunteer  As a graduate student, I assisted Dr. Macris during the 2020 semester as her Mineralogy course transitioned online and I was even able to help create curriculum material. I am the only student member of the Earth Sciences department community for improving diversity, equity, and inclusivity called GeoCORE. I am also a driver for Meals on Wheels of Central Indiana, a non-profit organization that delivers food to central Indiana’s homebound community. "

When I started the program, I was working as a Registered Nurse and also have a young family. Being able to take classes online afforded me the flexibility to balance school and my professional/personal life. It has been amazing to learn from world-renowned researchers and educators at the School of Nursing and at IUPUI!  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I chose IUPUI for a multitude of reasons. My graduate degree is also from IUPUI, so I was familiar with the strong reputation of IUPUI and the School of Nursing. I was attracted to the PhD program at the School of Nursing for a few reasons. The nursing coursework is offered in a hybrid format, allowing flexibility to take courses synchronously online or in-person. When I started the program, I was working as a Registered Nurse and also have a young family. Being able to take classes online afforded me the flexibility to balance school and my professional/personal life. It has been amazing to learn from world-renowned researchers and educators at the School of Nursing and at IUPUI!  I also really liked the idea of studying a formal minor during PhD coursework. As nurses, we tend to get siloed in the world of health care and focus heavily on science during undergraduate work. The PhD program at IUPUI allowed me to complete a formal minor in Sociology through the School of Liberal Arts. My minor coursework allowed me to meet other students from across campus, build relationships with sociology faculty, and broaden my thinking as a nurse through incorporating sociology theory into my doctoral work.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  Being named an Elite 50 graduate student in 2021! What an honor to be recognized with so many other exceptional students across campus. I was also admitted into the PhD in Nursing Science program as a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Future of Nursing Scholar. This is a national program of other PhD nursing students and nurse faculty that focuses on the professional development of nurse scientists through mentorship, research, and financial support. I have met so many great nurses from across the country who have become close friends and have similar interests in improving health care and the nursing profession.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  How much Indy has grown into a world-class vibrant city! I am from Indy originally, so I’m a bit biased. I love the restaurant scene, affordability, friendliness of the people, and the plethora of things to do from sporting events to the arts. The month of May is by far my favorite month in Indy, as I kick it off with a trip to the Broad Ripple Art Fair and end it with sitting in the stands at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway watching the 500. No other place like it in the world.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  My dissertation focuses on the importance of mentoring relationships as an intervention for nurses who enter into the academic faculty role. Nursing has a shortage of nurses and nurse faculty, which has large ramifications for the U.S. health care system. I have always been interested in how nurses learn the academic faculty role and how mentoring plays a role in the transition from nurse-to-nurse faculty. Mentoring is widely recommended in many different professions, but the interpersonal aspect of mentoring may impact the quality and effectiveness in mentoring relationships. My dissertation presents a theoretical framework of the process of mentoring among new nurse faculty and how mentoring relationships can impact the transition into academia.  I have presented research regarding the transition of nurse faculty into academia and mentoring of nurse faculty at international conferences sponsored by Sigma Theta Tau, the International Honor Society of Nursing. On campus, I am involved in the School of Nursing through serving on the PhD Student Advisory Group, being a student panelist for our annual PhD Summer Intensive and was an undergraduate course TA. I am also an active member of the Alpha Chapter of Sigma Theta Tau here at IUPUI. Lastly, I have been a Registered Nurse for 15 years, and my clinical background includes cardiac critical care and maternal-child health. "

Their connections and stories deepen the academic experience and challenge me to apply classwork to the real world.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  Indianapolis is the place to be for public health in the state—from policy work at the State Government to disease monitoring at the State and County Health Departments to social determinants of health at local NGOs to biostatistics and research at Eli Lilly! Even more, IUPUI also offers an affordable education, competitive with other schools of public health. Our professors have years of experience working in both the public and private sectors, at county, state, national, and international levels. Their connections and stories deepen the academic experience and challenge me to apply classwork to the real world.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  The opportunities for international experiences and becoming an aware global citizen have been some of my most challenging and memorable experiences here. I am completing a three-month internship in Rwanda at the Ministry of Health, partaking in a rare opportunity to work at a national level abroad, hopefully publish a paper, and learn about global health truly from a Rwandan context. I have also helped lead student groups to Nicaragua and Swaziland for different global health projects and traveled as a study abroad participant to El Salvador. Learning not only about public health in various nations has not only given me authentic experiences for a global health resume, but also encouraged me to develop a robust understanding of varying sociocultural and historical perspectives influencing health.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  I love the ever-developing neighborhoods of Indy! I started living in Indianapolis as an undergraduate in 2010, and the changes in the past six years, especially in Fountain Square and Mass Ave, have been tremendous. There is always a new restaurant to visit. However, my favorite part of life here revolves around the canal, where I can walk my dog, read a book, or enjoy the Regatta in September.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  When I graduate in December, I will have worked at the Office of Study Abroad for 2.5 years, advising students on study abroad programs, developing promotional events, and integrating study abroad into curricula. I formerly worked with Dr. Rachel Vreeman and the IU-Kenya partnership on HIV/AIDS research in children and adolescents in Kenya. This fall, I will intern at the State Department of Health in Enteric Diseases. "

I am from Indianapolis so it has been a great experience seeing the city grow in many ways. There are a lot of things to do from tasty restaurants, to art shows and museums.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I chose to go to IUPUI because I am from Indianapolis and it offers great programs for graduate students. I also work full time for the Indianapolis Public Library so I was really attracted to the online graduate Library Science program.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  My final paper for Public History was accepted as part of a panel presentation in January for the annual American Historical Association conference. I am ready to present because of all of the support I receive from my professors throughout the whole process of getting the proposal accepted to providing feedback on my presentation. My research focuses on an intersectional history of Indianapolis exploring the drag queen performers in popular jazz clubs along Indiana Avenue from the 1930s well into the 1970s. I really enjoy doing the research and uncovering the lives of these hidden figures which add value to the diverse history of Indianapolis.  Also, I will travel to Brazil to present a poster for the International Federation of Public History this summer. I am excited to explore and take advantage of the professional conferences and participating in them. It is a great way to network and meet other professionals in the field. My poster is in collaboration with another history grad at Howard University. This poster details how public historians can call upon the help of international volunteer organizations, like the Peace Corps, to assist in gathering information for their research. Many Peace Corps volunteers receive course credit for their service and are integrated members in their communities. When I was a Peace Corps volunteer in Paraguay, I assisted an oral historian on her research with Afro-Paraguayan women. As a trusted member of the community, I was able to introduce her to my contacts and she seamlessly conducted her interviews now part of a published book. I think this process can be replicated in many other ways.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  I really enjoy living close to downtown where I can ride my bike to class and work. I am from Indianapolis so it has been a great experience seeing the city grow in many ways. There are a lot of things to do from tasty restaurants, to art shows and museums. I really enjoy the diverse restaurants popping up along West 38th Street.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  I am the current president of Association of Library and Information Science Students (ALISS). I really enjoy leading this group because we come up with really fun activities that we can do together and relax and develop relationships with future professionals in the field. My research has spanned both fields of study on the library science side as well as the public history side. I was a research assistant for my professor in library school to determine how professional researchers are gathering their information. This is not the most glamorous study to take part in unless you are a library professional figuring out ways to make information more accessible to those who need it. So it is warming to know that I contributed in a small way to the advancement of knowledge in library science.  I worked on various exciting local history projects and even held an internship last semester in the Butler University Archives. I must say that there is nothing comparable to the hands-on experience gained at internships or shadowing someone in the field of your interest. I will add that also finding a mentor in your field is very important while in grad school.

    "body": "  # Riley Michael  Sandel   ### Master of Public Affairs (MPA) with a concentration in Urban and Regional Governance  The O’Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs has one of the most well regarded academic programs at the graduate level and a renowned faculty working between Bloomington and Indianapolis.   ##### Master of Public Affairs (MPA) with a concentration in Urban and Regional Governance  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  There are several reasons why I chose to attend graduate school at IUPUI. One of the major reasons was the location. After completing undergrad at a college town, it was important for me – as a student of urban policy – to immerse myself educationally in an urban setting. Additionally, the O’Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs has one of the most well regarded academic programs at the graduate level and a renowned faculty working between Bloomington and Indianapolis. To avoid belaboring this list, a final reason why IUPUI was a great graduate school choice for me was the cohort. As an urban center for Indiana and the region, IUPUI serves a diverse range of students (though there are still steps to make everywhere in this regard). This manifests in diverse demographics, experiences, educational backgrounds, hometowns, and much more! The graduate cohort alone at IUPUI provides an important educational opportunity for students to learn inside and outside of the classroom.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  My favorite academic accomplishment since being at IUPUI is not a single project or event. Rather, it has been the ability to work collaboratively with faculty and students to achieve great effort and results. In comparison to getting an assignment and simply regurgitating information, IUPUI and the O’Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs have provided a platform to critically engage in topics and produce individualized projects that dig deeper than an average topical survey course.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Personally, I am a huge fan of the park system and trails. As someone that enjoys the outdoors, I think Indianapolis is saturated with good park systems, areas for birding, close hiking, and plenty of growing trails. Second to that, Indianapolis also has a surprisingly robust music scene, locally and nationally. With a few great concert venues, Indianapolis’ culture is always progressing.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  As a graduate student at IUPUI, I have had the opportunity to work as a Graduate Assistant for Dr. Eckerd in the O’Neill School. Through this work, we have researched topics ranging from Resiliency Plans across the east cost to the effects of infrastructure change on communities in our present-day cities. Similarly, as a summer position, I got the chance to work as a Research Assistant for Dr. Christian Buerger in the O’Neill School. With Dr. Buerger, I was able to gain skills utilizing software and was introduced to econometrics research. As a final note on faculty collaborations, as an IUPUI graduate student I got the chance to work on real projects with two other faculty members, studying upward mobility amongst youth and hosting a community forum with several other graduate students.  Outside of coursework and assistantships, as a graduate student I serve as the Secretary for the Public Affairs Student Association chapter at the O’Neill School. This position involves increasing the cohesiveness of the graduate cohort within the O’Neill School. It has been a great opportunity to get to meet other students with vastly different backgrounds than my own as we all work toward receiving graduate degrees from similar graduate programs.  A final note on activities – that I find important for all graduate students – has been the rewarding chance to work with local nonprofits in Indianapolis using skills and knowledge gained from my graduate and undergraduate experiences and formal education. By joining these groups as an extracurricular outside of school, work, and family, I have been able to put knowledge to use in helping a couple of organizations in Indianapolis achieve some of their goals and learn an immense amount from them along the way.

    "body": " All stipends are taxable income. For tax purposes, you must keep copies of all award notices and announcements.  If you receive a fellowship or a stipend, you must consider your federal tax liability. Federal government agencies require students to determine taxation of scholarships and fellowships when filing annual income tax returns. IUPUI does not issue 1099s to scholarship holders.   ## Stipends and Tuition  The general rule is that any income is subject to federal taxation. All stipends are taxable income ; depending on how your department processes your stipend it may be considered a fellowship and taxes are not withheld, which does not mean you are not responsible for paying taxes.  You will not receive a 1099 IRS tax form at the end of the year.  Graduate students are responsible for paying all income taxes that may become due as a consequence of receiving graduate fellowship stipend payments.  The IRS provides general information through the IRS Live Telephone Assistance live at 800-829-1040 or you can visit IRS Tax Publication 970 for more details.  [IRS Tax Publication 970](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-970)   ## Who Must File  All students must file federal income tax and state income tax. If you reside or have worked in another state, you may have to file in those states, also.  Most graduate students are exempt from FICA, social security, and Medicare.   ## International Students  Special rules apply to international students, visiting scholars and non-resident aliens. The IRS requires educational institutions to report scholarship and fellowship grants to non-resident aliens on form 1042S-Foreign Person's US Sourced Income Subject to Withholding.  It is your responsibility to determine that the withheld amount is correct, e.g., whether a tax treaty exemption applies, whether the reduced withholding rate applies, etc.  The IU Office of International Services’ (OIS) tax site has more information for international students.  [IU Office of International Services’ (OIS)](https://ois.iu.edu/living-in-the-us/taxes/index.html)   ## When to File  Students must file estimated taxes quarterly. Those waiting until the end of the year to file may be subject to penalties.  Estimated taxes for the calendar year are due in four installments:  Payments should accompany a form 1040-ES with the student's social security number listed on the form. Failure to make these payments on time may result in the assessment of underpayment penalties.

Through my work at Lilly and studies at IUSM, I have met great colleagues and friends who are very friendly, supportive, and always willing to help.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  After completing my undergraduate and master’s degrees at Indiana University Bloomington and Indianapolis, I chose to pursue my Ph.D. at Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM) because of the excellent research opportunities and the possibility of continuing my graduate studies while maintaining my work at Lilly.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  I developed a humanized mouse model for peanut allergy, which was critical to evaluate the efficacy of an allergen-specific inhibitor. Using this model, I demonstrated that the inhibitor can prevent IgE-mediated anaphylaxis and prevent mast cell activation after allergen exposure. A manuscript describing the model and these findings is now in revision at a high impact journal. I am very proud to be part of this effort to help improve the quality of life for peanut allergy patients, and I am excited to learn about the inhibitor's efficacy in human clinical trials.  I also generated exciting data through my work on an animal model of multiple sclerosis that could help reveal therapeutic targets for autoimmune inflammatory diseases and neuroinflammation.  My other favorite academic accomplishments are winning the abstract trainee award to attend the American Association of Immunologists for the last three years, receiving the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) Travel Award to attend the FASEB Neuroimmunology conference, and receiving an IUPUI Travel Fellowship. I have enjoyed the opportunities to learn and network by attending and presenting at these conferences.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  What I like most about Indianapolis is the people. Through my work at Lilly and studies at IUSM, I have met great colleagues and friends who are very friendly, supportive, and always willing to help. I enjoy spending time with them exploring the city.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  My main Ph.D. project at the laboratory of Dr. Mark Kaplan focuses on defining the function of signaling and transcription factor STAT4 during the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis. I used conditional knockout mice to examine STAT4 function in various immune populations including T cells, myeloid cells, and dendritic cells. I demonstrated that STAT4 in dendritic cells is required for the development of the disease. Through different sets of adoptive transfer experiments, I further defined the role of STAT4 and interleukin-23 (IL-23) signaling in dendritic cells and how this signaling modulates disease development. I have ongoing experiments to define STAT4 regulated genes in EAE. Additionally, I performed a transcriptome analysis approach using publicly available gene expression data to define STAT4 target genes in dendritic cells in multiple sclerosis patients and how these genes regulate disease induction to examine if the findings in mice translate to humans.

There is also something to be said about having so many business and internship opportunities so close by.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I attended IUPUI as an undergraduate and I loved the atmosphere and the community; I couldn’t wait to come back.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  My favorite academic accomplishment while earning my MFA would have to be being able to work on co-designing a public seating area for the Herron grounds. A generous gift from the Christel DeHaan Foundation made it possible that two others and I could make a permanent, creative mark on the IUPUI campus.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  The integration of the IUPUI campus into the bustling downtown setting is always a plus. I love the fact that you can go to lunch in a metropolitan setting and come back to study in the library within the same half hour. There is also something to be said about having so many business and internship opportunities so close by.  Indianapolis also possesses that classic midwestern charm in some areas while crossing over into a vibrant city in other areas. You get the privilege of experiencing the best of both worlds.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  My body of work consists of 3 dimensional and 2 dimensional pieces that speak to the socio-political relationship between the Middle East and the West. Some of my latest work immerses audience members in engaging installations; these usually push viewers to open discussions regarding the buried, much more violent reality of the Middle-Eastern / Western dynamic.  I was honored to receive the position of Graduate Admissions Fellow at Herron School of Art & Design upon acceptance into IUPUI. It has offered an invaluable experience in higher education administration. It has also allowed me the opportunity to connect with incoming and prospective graduate students. The knowledge that I have gained through this appointment will be what allows me to open doors on a career in Arts Administration.  I was excited that I was able to join the Graduate Professional Student Government (GPSG) here at IUPUI this year. This has allowed me to be involved in university-wide decision making regarding student life on campus. Through this experience, I was able to get involved in the Faculty Diversity, Equity and Inclusion committee as a student representative as well as attend Campus Arts Committee meetings. All three of these organizations do work for our student and faculty body that I am passionate about and so glad to be a part of initializing. "

    "body": "  # Jared  Smith   ### M.D. / Ph.D.  I really enjoy the downtown area with its sports teams and restaurants. I live ten minutes from downtown and am still very close to the shopping centers and restaurants of suburban Indianapolis.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I originally started here as a post baccalaureate student in the IPREP program where I worked in the lab of Dr. Fletcher White in the Stark Neuroscience Institute. As someone who is very interested in neuroscience, working in that building allowed me to observe the various neuroscience research ongoing here. Also I really enjoyed life in Indianapolis. I moved here from Alabama where we do not have any major professional sports teams – having teams downtown really appealed to my extracurricular interests. These interests summated to applying to the MD/PhD program as I saw that the program, school, and city provided an environment that I felt would help me most develop personally and career-wise. I was accepted and I am currently a first year medical student.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  Aside from matriculating into the Medical Scientist Training Program (MD/PhD) here, I was very excited to be included as third author on a publication from the White Lab. Being my first time included on a research paper, I took this accomplishment as an acknowledgement and reward of my hard work in the lab.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  I really enjoy the downtown area with its sports teams and restaurants. I live ten minutes from downtown and am still very close to the shopping centers and restaurants of suburban Indianapolis. One thing I often tell my friends in Alabama is how close Indianapolis is to other big cities (Chicago, Louisville, etc). I also really enjoy the canal.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  I started working in Dr. White’s lab as a member of the IPREP program and continued working in the lab through my first rotation of the MD/PhD program. The projects I worked on in the lab ranged from potential treatments for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) to reducing pain through electro-acupuncture. I presented some of the work at the Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students (ABRCMS) in Seattle, IU research Day, and VA research day as part of IPREP or IU MSTP. Additionally, my contributions helped earn co-authorships on a couple research papers. "

Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  The Biology Department is very diverse in research focus and the breadth of resources appealed to me. In addition, there are no rotation requirements so I was able to choose a lab with a research interest that matched mine and get started right away.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  I was awarded the Outstanding PhD research award for the department of Biology this year.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Indianapolis is a really accessible city with a little bit of everything – we have amazing green spaces, artists, music venues, and a growing food and drink scene. Close to campus is a new development, 16Tech, and the AMP is a great place to get food, drinks, go to special events, and do some co-working.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  My current research objective is to determine efficacy of in vivo TRPV4-targeted pharmacotherapies in the treatment of hydrocephalus (excess fluid accumulation) in rodent models. I hypothesize that this TRPV4 ion channel has a site of action on the choroid plexus epithelial tissue which contributes to fluid production and homeostasis. I am also working to characterize the TRPV4-mediated pathways which contribute to ion flux, water movement, and cell swelling. It is my career objective to successfully characterize pharmacotherapies for the management of neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, and trauma-induced neurological diseases associated with excess fluid accumulation. My academic interests include basic research in physiology and pharmacology, as well as teaching and education outreach in physiology. "

ICOSR is a prestigious conference, drawing researchers from around the globe to come together and discuss recent developments in schizophrenia research. As a graduate student, my attendance was invaluable, as it helped me to build connections while also exposing me to new ideas and refining my own research interests.   ## Igor Ogashawara - Applied Earth Science  In February 2017 I attended the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO) Aquatic Sciences Meeting in Honolulu, HI. This is an event that occurs every two years and it is an important event for aquatic scientists worldwide. In this year event, around 2000 people from more than 50 different countries attended the meeting. For me, this event is special because there is not any other scientific event specific for my research field (which is remote sensing of water quality). Therefore, many researchers in this same research field attend ASLO Aquatic Sciences Meeting to share their ongoing projects. In this year event, there was a session entitled \"Global Remote Sensing of Inland Waters\" in which I was the only student schedule to give an oral presentation. My presentation was entitled “Improvement of Phycocyanin Estimation by Eliminating the Effect of Chlorophyll-a and Colored Dissolved Matter” and aimed to showcased a new bio-optical algorithm that we developed in our research group at the Department of Earth Sciences. This new algorithm was design to fulfill the spectral bands requirements from the next generations of satellites and sensors from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and European Space Agency (ESA). Sharing and getting feedback about my research as well as the amazing sessions in the scientific program made this a great experience!   ### Fall 2016 Award Recipients   ## Fotios-Christos A. Kafantaris - Applied Earth Sciences  The IUPUI Travel Fellowship assisted me financially to present my research at the 2016 Annual Meeting of the American Geophysical Union. My oral presentation had the title \"Polysulfides reactivity and their impact on sulfur biogeochemistry\". In a nutshell, I study the thermodynamics and kinetics of a reaction involving elemental sulfur, sulfide and polysulfides. The importance of this reaction is related to the bioavailability of this element to microbial cells in a plethora of environments, from anoxic marine waters to geothermal systems such as Yellowstone. Furthermore, this reaction plays a drastic role in sulfur cycling during its interaction with other elements, such as carbon and iron. Even though this chemistry has been studied in the past, the pioneering aspect of my work is that I attempt to characterize the kinetics and thermodynamics of this reaction utilizing nanoparticulate elemental sulfur, a form of sulfur that is a product of microbial metabolism as well as of inorganic processes. The presentation was very successful, as well as the whole conference. I interacted with a vast variety of people, from famous academics to graduate students like myself. I am thankful to the grad school for this support and I am confident that my research will contribute to IUPUI's good reputation.   ## Krystal Breslin - Biology  In September I attended the International Symposium on Human Identification in Minneapolis, MN. While there I presented my work during the poster session entitled Forensic DNA Phenotyping Through Massive Parallel Sequencing. Our lab, as well as my work, currently focuses on predicting what an individual looks like from DNA left at the crime scene. Current tools developed by Dr. Walsh and her collaborators can predict eye hair and skin color in two reactions, but we are currently are looking to increase the accuracy of these predictions as well as add on additional traits. That is where my work and my poster come in. Through my work with an in-house assay developed on the Illumina Miseq for Next Generation Sequencing we are able to increase the amount of genetic information we can obtain as well as add on additional markers. This also opens doors to improving our phenotyping method, allowing us to obtain a wide range of new information from our current database. All of this will be very influential in taking DNA phenotyping to the next level.   ## Christine Kassab - Applied Earth Sciences  In December 2016 I attended the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco, CA. There I presented a poster on a segment of my research titled \"The development of blue ice moraines from englacial debris bands as detected by GPR, Mt Achernar, central Transantarctic Mountains, Antarctica.\" Blue ice moraines have the potential to provide important information regarding how glaciers responded to climate change over the last few glacial-interglacial cycles, but not much is understood about how these moraines develop and what the record of glacier behavior looks like. This is where my research comes into play. I am looking at trying to understand the development and evolution of these moraines using a multi-disciplinary approach and using the structural and sedimentological record they contain to better understand changes in glacier behavior over time. With the knowledge gained, we can hypothesize how the glacier may respond to current climate change.   ## Yannan (Lukia) Li - Philanthropic Studies  Being selected as the ARNOVA (Association for Research on Nonprofit Organizations and Voluntary Action) Doctoral Fellow for the 45th ARNOVA Annual Conference. This was my second time to attend and present at the ARNOVA conference and I was very excited. ARNOVA is known as one of the most remarkable associations in philanthropic studies; its annual conference connects scholars, teachers, and practice leaders interested in research on nonprofit organizations, voluntary action, philanthropy and civil society, nationally and internationally. For me it was a great opportunity to share my research experience and findings with other scholars, receive intellectual advice, and be exposed to mentoring and networking opportunities. Prior to the conference, I took part in a one-day Doctoral Fellows Seminar with seven doctoral students with diverse research backgrounds, and three outstanding faculty members in the field. I was able to present my dissertation research and received valuable feedback, which helped me to explore several emergent analytic frameworks and to gain new insights that I have overlooked.   ## Asma Beiraghi Salek - Biology  In November 2016, I attended the Society For Neuroscience annual meeting in San Diego, CA. I presented a poster on my research there entitled “Mechanisms underlying spinophilin dependent regulation of PP1 association with the NMDA receptor.” My research focuses on the interactions between various synaptic proteins in neuronal cells. Normal brain function is a result of proper connectivity between neurons which is achieved by proper organization of synaptic proteins. Any change in the interactions between synaptic proteins can lead to an alteration in normal brain function. My research tries to uncover the molecular and cellular basics of specific protein-protein interactions that underlie important pathways in learning and memory. These findings allow for a better understanding of the molecular basis of number of brain functions and can also pave the way to understand a number of brain disorders.   ## Melanie Perella - Applied Earth Sciences  I had the opportunity to attend a conference called Time Series Analysis in Environmental Science and Climate Change Applications hosted by a European science consortium. The meeting was held in Tromsø, Norway from November 8th through the 11th. The conference consisted of a two day workshop, aimed at providing students practical experience with studying long term environmental data sets and detecting climatic trends within them. The remaining days were spent as a conference hearing from other scientists about the climate time series that they have developed. Conference attendees were also provided the opportunity to take a Northern Lights tour, a nighttime trek to find the Aurora Borealis.   ## Kathryn Holper - Geology  The title of my research was, \"A High-Resolution Paleoclimate Record from Laguna de Siscunsi, Boyaca, Colombia.\" In essence, Laguna de Siscunsi likely contains continuous sediment archives of Northern Hemisphere South American monsoon system variability over the last ~2-3 thousand years. Using sediment archives (specifically, lake and watershed characterization, geochronology, sedimentology and geochemistry), we hope to gain further understanding of the local paleoclimate and hydrological cycles. Siscunsi is located at high-altitude, and its waters feed into other regional lakes, including nearby Lago de Tota, which provides water resources for more than ~400,000 people. Thus, an improved record of past and present changes in this regional hydrological system will allow for a better understanding of how continued global and local climate change might affect these sensitive hydrologic systems, and the populations who depend on them.

The city is also very green, I enjoy biking on the Eagle Creek Trail, canal, and even in the downtown area.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I chose IUPUI because Dr. Larriba (my advisor) specializes in my field of interest and agreed to advise me and sponsor my PhD here. Also, having two prestigious universities’ names attached to my degree is always a benefit.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  My favorite accomplishment has to be the incorporation of the rotational degree of freedom into the computation of ion mobility. Using this computing skill, we partnered with a major institute - Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). This partnership resulted in the acceptance of an oral presentation at the top conference – ASMS – and we published a manuscript in the Analytical Chemistry journal (I.F. 6.8). The conference allowed an opportunity to network with leaders in the field, who indicated an interest in future collaboration.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  As a motorsports lover, I couldn't have picked a better city than the one that hosts the Indy 500, The city is also very green, I enjoy biking on the Eagle Creek Trail, canal, and even in the downtown area. Because of biking, I got to know that the downtown has surprisingly large and amazing houses! The city is also quite affordable with big city perks. I like the pace of Indianapolis. It is neither too fast and hectic, nor too dull.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  Research: My study focuses on numerical simulations of ion and gas molecule momentum transfer under various situations. In the last few years, experimental instruments have evolved dramatically, and the findings obtained by such devices cannot be explained by current theories. My aim is to characterize these effects and aid in the separation of structurally identical ions.  Other involvements:  Viraj received a Travel Fellowship Award from the Graduate Office. Here is his experience at the conference:  The American Society for Mass Spectrometry (ASMS)’s 69th conference on Mass Spectrometry and Allied Topics is one of the most appropriate platforms for presenting my work. Being reviewed by world-renowned scientists and having discussions with them (in particular, with Dr. Glenn Spangler) about my research brought tremendous value in my early stage of research. In the same session with me, different scientists from similar areas such as Biopolymer and Protein Structures Determination, Biochemistry, Pharmaceuticals, etc. presented their work. Their research was very insightful and showed me the possible improvements in my work. The highlight of the conference for me was when, at the end of my presentation session, an industry expert, Dr. Alexandre Shvartsburg, approached me and invited to collaborate! The conference provided a wonderful opportunity for me to create both an academic and a professional network, which I took full advantage of. The five-day long conference and staying in a different city also provided a platform to bond with my new lab mates. "

My favorite academic accomplish has been winning the Greater Indiana Society for Neuroscience Research Image Contest in 2022. I love microscopy, so it was great to share one of my favorite images with others at this meeting.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  I really enjoy spending time outdoors in Indianapolis - I truly love the weather here. During my free time outside of the lab, I can most often be found running on the Monon Trail, hiking, or participating in other outdoor activities.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  My research is centered upon uncovering the role of Ref-1 in retinal neovascularization. Retinal neovascularization impairs visual function in millions of people worldwide. Current treatments include intravitreal (IVT) injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) biologics. However, these therapeutics are often accompanied by high treatment burden and resistance to therapy. Previous research indicates that VEGF alone is not sufficient for induction of neovascularization, suggesting that multiple disease-relevant pathways may be targeted to increase therapeutic response. Thus, there is a critical need to develop novel therapies that modulate multiple disease-relevant pathways and circumvent the issues with IVT injections. Prior studies indicate that Ref-1 regulates multiple transcription factors that are linked to retinal neovascularization. But, the underlying molecular mechanisms of the Ref-1 target in retinal neovascularization have yet to be elucidated. Identifying the molecular mechanism underlying Ref-1 in retinal neovascularization is critical in developing novel therapies to reduce vision loss.  Aside from research, I am actively involved in the SNRI Women in Neuroscience committee and am currently serving on the Stark Summer Symposium Organization committee. I also spend time engaging with and educating the public through social media platforms to help make science more accessible to a broader audience. "

What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  I think becoming a PhD candidate is my proudest achievement at IUPUI (so far). It’s the culmination of everything I’ve worked for up until this point!  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Since I’ve moved to Indy, I’ve gotten into rock climbing, and one of my favorite things about Indy is how close it is to some world-class climbing! The Red River Gorge has some of the best sandstone sport climbing and is about 4 hours away. However, my favorite spot is Stone fort, a boulder field near Chattanooga, TN with THE COOLEST classic boulders. It is about a 7 hour drive and easily my favorite weekend destination!  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  My research revolves around orthogonal polynomials; special families of functions that appear in several applications like physics and approximation theory, amongst others. Of course, being a graduate student comes with some teaching responsibility, and I take pride in doing the best job I can to describe why mathematics is literally the best thing ever. Apart from research and teaching, I serve as the secretary of the American Mathematical Society [AMS] graduate student chapter. Part of my responsibility is to help organize events for graduate students like problems-solving sessions, inviting and hosting speakers, student mini-courses/presentation, and qualifying exam workshops. Recently, I have gotten involved with a group of School of Science graduate students organizing a multidisciplinary research symposium over the summer. Our inaugural symposium was quite a success, and I’m very excited for our second go this summer. "

Shell   ### Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology  The Clinical Psychology PhD program at IUPUI encompasses...qualities of a strong training program and affords students opportunities to get both specialized and diverse training, with access to several nearby medical centers for both research and clinical training.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I sought a doctoral program with rigorous research and excellent clinical training in health psychology. The Clinical Psychology PhD program at IUPUI encompasses these qualities of a strong training program and affords students opportunities to get both specialized and diverse training, with access to several nearby medical centers for both research and clinical training. Moreover, IUPUI is home to many faculty members who value both productivity and mentorship, two additional aspects of training that are invaluable to me. For these reasons, I chose to join Dr. Jesse Stewart’s Cardiometabolic Behavioral Medicine (CBM) Lab.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  My first two years as a graduate student have been characterized by ambition. Thus far, I have written two first-author manuscripts and given two oral presentations, in addition to collecting data for and defending my master’s thesis. I am grateful for these opportunities to identify and develop my program of research.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  As a West Michigan girl, Indianapolis feels like home...but without my beloved Great Lakes. I love the Midwest hospitality and the access to nature, sports, and Meijer stores.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  My interest in cardiometabolic behavioral medicine has narrowed to the role of depressive symptoms on health outcomes such as obesity and diabetes. These interests are evident in my recent research projects: I conducted data collection for my master’s thesis on the association between depressive symptoms and food attentional bias—a cognitive tendency to notice food cues over other cues in one’s environment, which could lead to food consumption and obesity. Additionally, I have given two oral presentations corresponding to two first-author manuscripts: the first on depressive symptoms and behavioral weight loss attendance in a sample of primary care patients with obesity, and the second on depressive symptoms and insulin resistance in a sample of primary care patients with depression. In addition to my research endeavors, I have enjoyed honing my clinical skills in a primary care setting. I desire that my research will elucidate important psychosocial treatment targets to prevent and manage cardiometabolic diseases. "

What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  Since coming to IUPUI, I’ve had so many wonderful academic accomplishments. The first and foremost, however, is that I was selected to speak with one of the foremost experts in cultural accessibility and experts in accessibility from the Smithsonian at a conference that was supposed to take place in August. While that conference has been postponed to 2021, I am still working closely with these experts to develop a conference plan once things return to normal.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  The freedom to reinvent myself. Since moving to Indianapolis, I have been able to really start to explore my social life and be a much more independent person. I have discovered a love for cooking and my cohort is a wonderful group of friends that I am excited to continue to work with and spend time with as we push through graduate school together.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  First and foremost, I am involved with a corporate research study by a company called InfiniTeach to better understand how their apps are used. They provide accessibility apps for individuals with autism to better be able to participate in the museum, and I am providing my research and investigation skills to help them and their client organizations better understand how technology can be a part of this. I have also, for classes, worked with a wide number of museums to find out what programs and supports they have put in place to help people with autism get involved at their museums. Since then, I have started working with a number of local museums on their own accessibility initiatives, including the Indiana State Museum, Indianapolis Children’s Museum, the Kurt Vonnegut Museum and Library, and more. This work has also led me to an internship at the Eiteljorg Museum doing accessibility work as well, starting this fall. This is something that is incredibly important to me; I have autism myself. So many people are underserved by museums and institutions, and as someone who is able to share my experience, I feel like my voice and help provide one for those who can’t share their own.  Beyond that, I am currently working as the archives intern at the Great American Songbook Foundation. Most of my work there revolves around the digitization of the audio-visual material of Meredith Willson, as well as learning about the methods of taking old media and making it accessible to the general public as well as researchers. In what free time I get, I enjoy video games as well as reading books, and am currently working through a collection of Sherlock Holmes stories. "

Apart from my research, I have spent a lot of time participating in leadership roles all over IUPUI. I spent the first year of my graduate degree as the Graduate Senator for the Engineering and Technology Student Council (ETSC). ETSC provides great programming like the National Engineers week for students within the School of Engineering and Technology. At the departmental level, I have served in a number of roles within the Biomedical Engineering Graduate Student Association (BME GSA). BME GSA has focused on increasing social interactions within the department and with our alumni. This year, I also had the honor to serve as the President of the Graduate and Professional Student Government (GPSG). This year GPSG was the first organization ever to receive a Chancellor’s Medallion – a testament to all the great work our student representatives have achieved. Throughout all these opportunities, I have received great mentoring and met so many interesting, diverse and knowledgeable people. "

I am forever grateful to have worked on the DeHaan 50th Anniversary Sculpture generously funded by the Christel DeHaan Foundation in conjunction with the IUPUI Welcoming Campus Public Art Initiative. For this project, I, along with two fellow MFA candidates worked alongside professors, engineers, architects, and Chancellor Paydar to plan a new public sculpture that will be erected on Herron’s grounds later this spring. Having never worked on a sculpture of this scale, this opportunity was daunting yet completely thrilling. Ultimately the project taught us so much about public art and all of the work behind the scenes about how it is designed, approved for production, and created. Overall an amazing experience!  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Having grown up in the hustle and bustle of Southwest Florida, Indianapolis offers a refreshing scene. Instead of cars blaring their horns at you on a Monday morning, residents of Indianapolis often wave and say, “Good morning!” A very confusing but welcoming sight at first! The first few months I lived here fell in love with the kindness this city exudes. Now, even though I have been here two years, the residents never cease to surprise me with their generosity and thoughtfulness. Indianapolis feels like a small town but offers all of the culture, art, and experiences of a larger city.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  When I arrived at Herron School of Art + Design as a sculpture graduate student I had only previously had access to basic woodworking tools: band saw, miter saw, and table saw, etc. Since I have been here, I have tried to take every opportunity to learn how to utilize as many of the amazing tools that we have access to as students. I have learned how to weld, been taught how to use the CNC (Computer Numerical Control) router, studied how to use the laser cutter, and have been taught the basics of furniture design. Through my newly learned skills, I have been able to diversify my portfolio and push what I originally thought was possible in my work. Currently, I am working on creating a life-size humpback whale skeleton for my thesis project. This project employs the 3D rendering software Rhino to map out forms that will eventually be cut out of Styrofoam using the CNC router.  I am very grateful to have received a Graduate Teaching Fellowship that allowed me to observe and assist a professor during my first two semesters. I learned priceless lessons during that time, which I now am applying in my own classes, Sculpture One and Two! "

My master’s research focuses on Lawrenz Gun Club (11Cs4), a Mississippian Period (A.D. 1050-1425) village located in the central Illinois River valley of west-central Illinois. The village remained poorly understood until initial excavations began in 2010 led by Dr. Jeremy J. Wilson’s (IUPUI) field school. Lawrenz is a large, fortified Mississippian period village with multiple earthworks, plazas, and structures within and outside palisades. The household structures provide a unique opportunity to evaluate the working assemblage and domestic activities of the Mississippian people residing at the village. These structures, dating to the 14th century, were incinerated during the final days of the village’s occupation, which left a rich and relatively complete picture of the households.  My main research question asks what constitutes a prototypical household at a site like the Lawrenz Gun Club. From a diachronic perspective, the broader questions ask, how were the relations of domestic production within the household (re)organized with broader changes in the social and economic landscape of the central Illinois River valley during the Mississippian period. I focus on the analysis of material culture including ceramic, lithic, faunal and botanical sub-assemblages from two domestic structures excavated at Lawrenz. These in situ assemblages provide a relatively accurate palimpsest of what everyday life was like during a period of endemic warfare, culture contact and climate change in west-central Illinois. "

Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I chose graduate school at IUPUI because I am particularly interested in studying serious mental illness (SMI) and IUPUI’s clinical psychology program offers numerous clinical and research opportunities working with this population. These experiences include specialized classes within the program’s SMI concentration, practicum sites at community mental health centers focused on treating those with psychosis, and working in my mentor Dr. Kyle Minor’s lab investigating cognitive and affective impairment in those with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  I was recently awarded the Indiana CTSI TL1 Pre-doctoral Fellowship which will help support my dissertation research and offers various educational and research experiences. So far, I’ve really enjoyed designing and beginning to collect data for my project, and I appreciated the opportunity to present and discuss my project with other trainees and faculty at the CTSI annual meeting.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  As someone who grew up in the New York City metro area, I REALLY enjoy the cost of living in Indy! But I also love the many, genuinely kind people I’ve met here and how the smaller-sized city makes it easy to explore. After three years here, it certainly feels like home.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  I am a fourth-year doctoral student in the clinical psychology program at IUPUI. I work in the Cognition, Language, and Affect in Serious Psychopathology lab with Dr. Kyle Minor, and I’ve developed an emerging program of research focusing on how social and emotional impairment manifest in the daily lives of those with schizophrenia.

    "body": " Admission to graduate programs and applications for fellowships often requires testing of prior learning. The most commonly used of these examinations is the Graduate Record Examination, or GRE.   ## The GRE  The Graduate Record Examination (GRE), which is administered by ETS, is a computer-based test designed to measure quantitative, analytical, and language abilities. Your specific graduate program website will indicate their GRE requirements. There are a number of businesses that offer GRE test preparation materials. Some of them offer free practice tests and downloadable software for studying, including ETS. They also offer online and live courses with a wide range in pricing. Be sure to take advantage of all the free materials before making an investment in classes.  In addition, ETS offers a GRE Fee Reduction Program for individuals who can demonstrate financial need. Voucher users pay 50% of the regular test fee.  [GRE Fee Reduction Program](https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/register/fees/reductions)  To qualify for fellowships, many graduate programs require that you take the GRE by the October or December before your fall admission. Subject tests are offered on specific dates, but dates fill up quickly, so plan ahead. ETS, the administrator of the GRE, offers detailed information on its website.  ETS website  [ETS website](https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/prepare/)  Khan Academy Instructional Videos  [Khan Academy Instructional Videos](https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/prepare/quantitative_reasoning/khan_academy)  Professional schools or programs at IUPUI may require other, more specialized tests, such as the GMAT for business or the LSAT for law. Check the website of your program of interest for more information.   ### English Proficiency Admission Requirements for Non-native Speakers of English   ## Policy  Effective with students admitted for fall 2000 and thereafter, to gain admission, all graduate and professional applicants to IUPUI whose native language is not English must demonstrate proficiency in English as a second language. This policy thus applies to students enrolling in all graduate level programs including graduate certificate programs. Applicants who hold a bachelor's degree or a graduate degree from an accredited university in the U.S. or an officially recognized university in a country where English is the predominant native language will be deemed proficient. Applicants from US territories and Puerto Rico for whom English is not their native language, will need to successfully complete the campus English for Academic Purpose (EAP) examination. All other students must perform satisfactorily on a standardized test of proficiency in English as a second language that measures students' preparedness for academic study.  [Applicants who hold a bachelor's degree or a graduate degree from an accredited university in the U.S. or an officially recognized university in a country where English is the predominant native language](http://international.iupui.edu/admissions/english-speaking-countries-grad.html)  This policy is a MINIMUM standard for the campus. This policy does not preclude any department or school from setting a higher standard. For example, some departments or schools may choose to require that all non- native speakers of English will take the EAP Placement Exam regardless of previous standardized test scores or education.  International applicants and non-native speakers of English may be required to take additional tests to demonstrate English proficiency and meet graduate or professional admission requirements. English proficiency can be demonstrated in many different ways. Be sure to verify English proficiency requirements with your program of interest before registering for a specific exam or program.  [English Proficiency Minimum Requirements](http://international.iupui.edu/admissions/how-apply/graduate/english.html)   ## TOEFL Exams  Applicants from non-English speaking countries must prove English proficiency and may be required to take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) examination in order to qualify for graduate study at IUPUI; many graduate programs require a score significantly higher than the minimum campus standard. Be sure to verify English proficiency requirements with your program of interest before selecting an alternative to the TOEFL.  The Office for International Affairs offers further information on English proficiency requirements on its website.  [Office for International Affairs](http://international.iupui.edu/admissions/how-apply/graduate/english.html)   ## IELTS Exam  An alternative testing system for English language skills is the International English Language Testing System (IELTS). The Office for International Affairs offers further information on English proficiency requirements on its website.  [Office for International Affairs](http://international.iupui.edu/admissions/how-apply/graduate/english.html)   ## English for Academic Purposes (EAP)  By University policy, most graduate students who are non-native speakers of English are required to take the EAP Placement Test prior to registering for classes, before the start of their first semester on campus, even if they completed the TOEFL test. Students’ letter of admission from the Office of International Affairs will indicate if they are required to take this test. Some students who are permanent residents, political asylees, or undocumented without a U.S. degree are strongly encouraged to take the EAP Placement test. Graduate students in this category should speak to their advisor or the EAP Program about enrolling into an EAP course. Both undergraduate and graduate students may elect to take EAP courses even if they are not required to. Because the EAP Placement Test is a placement test used to accurately determine English language skill level, students do not need to \"prepare\" for it. The scores are used to assign EAP classes that best meet students’ academic needs that will provide favorable English experiences necessary for a successful career at IUPUI and beyond. The courses prescribed based on the students’ results on the EAP Placement Test are required. Students who have not completed their EAP requirements will not be able to graduate.  The minimum placement is no course below G513 or G520 for any student who will enroll on an F-1 or J-1 visa.  NOTE for graduate students and advisers: Graduate students who are being considered for a teaching role (tutor, lab assistant, teaching assistant, course instructor) are also required by university policy to take the SPEAK test and complete any required supplemental EAP courses recommended based on that test. The Graduate Office monitors compliance with the campus policy.  [SPEAK test](https://liberalarts.iupui.edu/programs/eap/current-students-2/speak-test/?_ga=2.67711445.515607120.1638218071-1212298393.1632509291)  The Department of English lists information such as test dates, testing locations, registration instructions, and more. EAP students also can take advantage of the ESL Tutoring Center. For questions about dates and times for the current semester, please email esltutor@iupui.edu .  [Department of English](http://liberalarts.iupui.edu/english/pages/eap-program-folder/eap-placement-test.php)   ## Program for Intensive English (PIE)  The Program for Intensive English (PIE) at IUPUI provides non-native English speakers with language courses to improve their academic English skills. Once a student successfully completes Level 7 in the PIE, they will meet the minimum IUPUI English proficiency requirement. Be sure to verify English proficiency requirements with your program of interest to ensure they accept the PIE, and at what level.  [More information and application](https://liberalarts.iupui.edu/programs/inpie/)   ## Other acceptable examinations  Pearson Test of English - Academic (PTEA) minimum = 54.  Successful completion of ELS Language Center's Level 112.  Other objective tests of EAP proficiency and minimum scores as agreed upon by the English for Academic Purposes Program and the Office of International Affairs.   ## SPEAK Exam  Graduate students who are being considered for a teaching role (tutor, lab assistant, teaching assistant, course instructor) are also required by university policy to take the SPEAK test and complete any required supplemental EAP courses recommended based on that test. The Graduate Office monitors compliance with the campus policy. Students should connect with their Graduate Program advisor for more information on completing the SPEAK test.  [SPEAK Test](https://liberalarts.iupui.edu/programs/eap/current-students-2/speak-test/)   ## The ESL Tutoring Center  The ESL Tutoring Center serves students enrolled in EAP and PIE classes. EAP students please contact esltutor@iupui.edu for hours of operation and other information. PIE students, please contact PIE at inpie@iupui.edu or 317-274-4743.   ### Requirements upon arrival  Upon arrival, all graduate and professional students admitted to IUPUI who were required to take the TOEFL must take the EAP Placement Exam administered by the EAP Program before enrolling in the first semester of courses, unless they have submitted an official TOEFL iBT score at or above 100 or IELTS score at or above 7.5. Students must take the EAP courses in which they have been placed beginning in the first or second semester of enrollment at IUPUI.  Situations may arise in which newly admitted students are unable to access EAP testing (for example, students enrolled online full time). In these cases, such students may enroll in the EAP Program’s summer online G513 course prior to taking any other courses and with advanced permission from their IUPUI program director and the EAP director.

There is something for everyone, and you are never far away from a place. I relish the pleasant weather and the outdoor spaces.   #### Alumnus  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  IUPUI’s affiliation with Purdue University was the primary reason I applied. After receiving admits from multiple universities, I chose IUPUI because of the extensive research conducted by faculty members of the ECE department, specifically those working in the computer engineering and data sciences domains.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  The research I have done has been my proudest accomplishment at IUPUI. During my undergraduate program, coursework was the only focus and opportunities for research didn’t exist. Over the last year, I have worked on various inter-disciplinary projects in natural language processing, data sciences and healthcare. Each one of those projects has taught me something new that can only be learnt by research and practical experiments, not theory or coursework. As a result, in just over a year, I have already published 5 papers at various international conferences, with a few more I am currently working on to submit before I graduate.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Indianapolis strikes the perfect balance of a city that feels more like a big town. There is something for everyone, and you are never far away from a place. I relish the pleasant weather and the outdoor spaces.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  I am a Research Assistant in the Department of Computer Information Technology in the Purdue School of Engineering and Technology. Most of my time is spent working on applying natural language processing techniques to the healthcare domain. To this end, my primary research focuses on improving the preventive healthcare provided to patients by bridging the gap between preventive care guidelines and patient information in Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Another project that I have been working on focuses on improving document search and retrieval by clustering biomedical documents.  I am also a part of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering’s Data Driven Knowledge Discovery and Management, and Internet of Things laboratories. In the former, as a part of IUPUI and Citizens Energy Group’s Partnership for Excellence in Research and Learning (PERL) program, I developed a daily and monthly water demand prediction model for Citizens Energy Group.

Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I am working while pursuing a Ph.D. in Biomedical and Applied Sciences to earn qualifications to become Director of the HLA-Vascular Biology Laboratory at Franciscan Health Indianapolis. IUPUI is close to home and offers outstanding educational opportunities with flexible scheduling.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  Passing my qualifying exams and approval of my research project.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  I’ve lived in Indianapolis most of my adult life and have watched the city grow from “nap town”, as I have seen it called, to a vibrant city with cultural and social diversity. I especially like that with the growth of the city, the people of Indianapolis have preserved a feeling of sincerity, honesty and community.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  My dissertation project involves the role of oral bacteria in the nascent formation and growth of atheroma leading to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Bacteria form biofilms in the oral cavity and are the source of specific species of bacteria which enter the blood stream when oral tissues are disrupted by hygiene (tooth brushing), dental procedures and oral disease. Oral bacteria have been identified in human atherosclerotic plaques. Tobacco use is associated with increased risk of both cardiac and oral disease. My research focuses on the effects of nicotine on oral bacteria and on endothelial cells lining our blood vessels. My hypothesis is that exposure to tobacco products enhances the interactions between oral bacteria and endothelial cells; and by these interactions may promote atherosclerotic plaque formation and development.  Specifically, the goal of my project is to elucidate the mechanisms by which the causative agent of dental caries, Streptococcus mutans, interacts with endothelial cells with and without the pressure of nicotine exposure. I will investigate serotype k strains of S. mutans to gain insight into the increased prevalence of serotype k strains in diseased cardiovascular tissues compared to the oral cavity of the same subjects. My project bridges published studies of S.mutans in atherosclersclerotic plaques with observational studies reporting smoking is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular and oral diseases. Understanding the impact of smoking on the interactions between blood-borne bacteria and the endothelium will potentially aid in the understanding of how atherosclerosis develops and may lead to methods to prevent and treat the disease.

There were several factors that contributed to my decision to attend graduate school at IUPUI. Firstly, the atmosphere in the clinical psychology department is extremely positive. The faculty are student-centered and the graduate students are cooperative rather than competitive. Secondly, I have the opportunity to work with a wonderful faculty mentor, Dr. Michelle Salyers. I was initially excited to work with Dr. Salyers because our research interests closely align. Now, having worked with Dr. Salyers since 2014, I am very appreciative of the support and encouragement that she provides, both in terms of professional and personal growth. Lastly, IUPUI’s connection to multiple medical centers, such as Eskenazi Health, Riley Hospital for Children, and the Roudebush VA Medical Center, offers a range of diverse research and clinical training opportunities that I did not find at any other graduate schools.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  My favorite academic accomplishment was being admitted to doctoral candidacy. Reaching this major milestone was extremely exciting, and the independent research project that I successfully defended in order to qualify for candidacy opened up many opportunities. For example, I presented my research on a panel at a conference in Atlanta, GA. Several prominent researchers attended the panel discussion, which was exhilarating (and a bit anxiety-provoking)! Additionally, the results of my independent research project are currently under review in a peer-reviewed journal.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Having grown up in Los Angeles, CA, I particularly appreciate Indianapolis’ low cost of living and ease of getting around the city (in terms of both light traffic and abundant parking). I also enjoy the unique outdoor resources that this city has to offer, such as the Monon Trail and Canal Walk.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  My research centers on understanding factors that contribute to burnout in mental health providers. Burnout in the mental health field is a significant problem, affecting as many as 21% to 67% of providers. This is particularly troubling because burnout is associated with a number of negative outcomes for mental health providers and the people they serve. For my dissertation, I will be examining the effectiveness of BREATHE—a burnout reduction intervention co-created by my faculty mentor, Dr. Michelle Salyers. "

Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  I am a mixed media artist working in plaster, acrylic, latex, and more. As a queer person, I’ve grown an acute awareness to the relationship I have with place. Politics follows my body, filling me with fear, anxiety, and a general discomfort in public spaces. I think about my own experiences as an ‘other’ when constructing my mixed media objects. Through my lived experiences, I understand what it's like to be an oddity. I understand the baggage that then comes with being considered abnormal and the sense of powerlessness that comes with being otherized.  The Earth’s condition is rapidly deteriorating and I understand that this decomposition is directly linked to human action and therein, my own actions. I understand the sense of powerlessness that comes with watching climate change unfold and the sublime sense of guilt that comes with perpetuating it. This tension creates space for my work to fit snugly within the theoretical discussions of Queer Ecology; a term that aims to reimagine evolutionary processes, ecological interactions, and environmental politics.  The vibratic push-pull of inconsistency, uncertainty, and seemingly fluctuating forms runs through much of my work. This fluidity of form, mark, and status is again linked to the queer experience; an ever fluctuating status of identity. The reality of being permanently in flux is the reality of being queer. "

I am pursuing the Medical Humanities and Bio-Ethics Track in my American Studies PhD program. I am very interested in the human experience of pain. Although I have not finalized a dissertation topic, I plan to focus my research on issues involving the management of chronic pain. I hope to investigate which methods patients use to mitigate their pain that may deviate from the standard pain management practices currently being implemented by physicians. I’d like to explore ways to alleviate or bridge gaps in pain management between the patient and the physician. My career goal is to work in a hospital setting as a Clinical Ethicist, consulting on patient care cases that may require special ethical considerations.  The Medical Humanities and Bio-Ethics Track in the American Studies PhD program gives me the opportunity to take classes in numerous departments. The number of disciplines that Medical Humanities touches is particularly appealing to me. In my first two years in the program, I have taken courses in History, American Studies, Philosophy, Medical Humanities, Sociology, and Anthropology. As if that exposure weren’t enough, I also have the option to take courses in Economics, Communication, and other disciplines. The variety of coursework helps me to understand the full scope of the patient experience and the context in which we find ourselves as patients in the twenty-first century. I would love to teach Medical Humanities at an undergraduate or even graduate level. I am super passionate about spreading the knowledge I have gained and the incredible impact Medical Humanities can have on a patient’s experience. "

    "body": "  # Homaira  Azim   ### Ph.D. in Anatomy & Cell Biology  What I especially like about the IUPUI campus itself is its multicultural environment. I am happy to see a good level of acceptance, rather than mere tolerance, for different types of people and their cultures.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  Before coming to IUPUI, I was a physician who had 3 years of experience in teaching anatomy at the medical school level. I wanted to continue what I was doing, which was teaching rather than practicing clinical medicine. Soon, however, I realized that I needed a PhD in addition to my MD degree in order to secure a basic science faculty position for myself in the future. The Education Track PhD in Anatomy offered at the IU School of Medicine sounded like a perfect match for my specific interests. This program offers a minor in Education which is something I have always been interested in. In addition to active exposure to various pedagogical methods, the program provides students with vigorous training in both quantitative and qualitative research methodologies in the field of Medical Education. There are only 2-3 similar programs offered across the United States that pair anatomy with education research instead of laboratory bench research. Since I was already living in Indiana with my family, it was super lucky for me that I didn’t have to move out of state to pursue my graduate degree.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  My favorite academic accomplishment has been my engagement with the American Association of Anatomists (AAA) as a member. I had the opportunity of presenting my research as first author in AAA’s annual meetings at Experimental Biology (EB) Conference in San Diego, 2018, and Orlando, 2019, at the Anatomy Education Platforms. Both presentations were well-received by the audience which consisted of anatomists across the US as well as international scholars, post-docs and students. These two experiences helped in boosting my confidence as a novice researcher. In 2019, I also received a travel fellowship award from IUPUI to help fund my travel expenses to attend the EB meeting.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  I live in Greenwood which is a 30 minutes’ drive from downtown Indianapolis. Commuting to IUPUI campus daily, I enjoy having access to various facilities and attractions that come as advantages of living in a big city. My favorite place in downtown is Hilbert Circle Theatre which is home to the Indianapolis symphony orchestra. I love going to a live musical performance with my family on an ideal weekend. What I especially like about the IUPUI campus itself is its multicultural environment. I am happy to see a good level of acceptance, rather than mere tolerance, for different types of people and their cultures.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  Since I became a PhD student in Indianapolis, I have been teaching anatomy at various other institutions including Indiana State University, Chamberlain University, and Ivy Tech Community College as an adjunct faculty member in addition to various courses at IU School of Medicine. These appointments have helped me gain immensely valuable experience in teaching all anatomical sub-disciplines at the professional, graduate, and undergraduate levels. In the meantime, I have had the opportunity of writing several research and perspective papers as first author as well as collaborating with a team of renown researchers on one project. Currently, I am working on my dissertation research which uses Michel Foucault’s archaeological methodology for analyzing the modern discourse of medicine. My research committee chair, Dr. Jim Scheurich, has been a tremendous help in guiding me through this work. I am very excited about this project and am hoping to be able to publish it as a book after defending my dissertation. "

Getting the chance to trial lots of different types of research before picking your permanent lab was great opportunity to trial the diversity of the options and gain lab experience across multiple topics and techniques.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  The broad diversity of research that was conducted at the Medical School was really attractive. Getting the chance to trial lots of different types of research before picking your permanent lab was great opportunity to trial the diversity of the options and gain lab experience across multiple topics and techniques.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  I guess I’m split between doing well in the 3-minute thesis competition here at IUPUI. I really enjoy trying to break down my research into bit-size pieces and being able to capture the broad picture of why our research matters. Another favorite was being given the opportunity to present my research as an oral presentation at the International Society of Bone Histomorphometry this Fall in Florida.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Indianapolis is such a diverse city with lots of different activities you can get involved in. There are lots of music performances, sport events, great food, and the people are very friendly. For me, I have gained friendships that are like a second family and I love participating in recreational soccer and volunteering at Second Helpings. Being active and involved in the Indianapolis community provides me with a break from the lab and the academic world. Indianapolis has become home.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  Currently, I am involved in research that investigates what happens to bone both structurally and mechanically in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). As kidney function declines there are whole body implications with bone being one of those things affected. In CKD patients there is increased bone fragility and greater fracture risk in the CKD population. The bone loss associated with CKD is unique and is unlike other bone loss diseases. Holes known as pores form in the outer shell of cortical bone. Therefore, to improve the bone health in CKD patients, filling in these cortical pores could be an essential part of the story. However, we know little about pore infilling. My research focuses on if/how pores can infill in a CKD setting. "

I was the sole author and shortly after that I collaborated with a professor and our article was also accepted for publication with me as first author. Going through the peer review process was a great learning experience and it was exciting to see my work in journals.   ### PhD in Social Work.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I obtained my MSW at the IU School of Social Work here on the IUPUI campus and enjoyed that experience and the professors I had. Several of my professors and the Dean encouraged me to think about the PhD program. I had wanted to become a professor since entering college so the encouragement I received from my MSW program was reassuring. I kept in touch with the school after graduating and still sought guidance from some professors when it came time to seriously consider programs and apply. When it came time to apply to doctoral programs, this was the only one I wanted to attend so I was so thankful when I was accepted.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  After completing my two years of coursework I published my first article. I was the sole author and shortly after that I collaborated with a professor and our article was also accepted for publication with me as first author. Going through the peer review process was a great learning experience and it was exciting to see my work in journals. It was also somewhat surreal to go from reading articles as a student to now having my name on one with the potential for a student like me to someday read it. This was a great step for me as I prepare for life in academia.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  When I was getting my MSW I lived downtown with my wife. We loved being in walking distance of the canal as well as the all the restaurants and bars downtown has to offer. We now have two small children and though we don’t live downtown anymore, we now enjoy Indianapolis for all it has to offer young families like the Children’s Museum.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  During my first three years I was a project coordinator for a HRSA training grant. Over the three years of the grant, 98 MSW were trained in evidence based practices for working with transitional age youth. I have also had the opportunity to teach classes at both the graduate and undergraduate level, which I have thoroughly enjoyed. In addition to this I am also completing the Certificate of College Teaching offered through the Center for Teaching and Learning to enhance my teaching skills. I also am a reviewer for a social work journal that publishes the work of PhD students.  My research interests include child welfare with a focus on the service providers, interprofessional collaboration and education, and the scholarship of teaching and learning. I have been fortunate to find multiple professors and students to collaborate with both here on campus but also across the country who I continue to work with producing manuscripts for publication as well as conference presentations and posters.

Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  After finishing my medical school and clinical training in China, I realized there are still many diseases that do not have effective treatments in the clinic. Further work needed to be done to explore the detailed mechanisms of these diseases and generate therapies. Because of this, I decided to become a biomedical researcher in the future, and in order to achieve this goal, I applied to Indiana BioMedical Gateway (IBMG) program at Indiana University School of Medicine. There are two reasons I chose IBMG IUSM - firstly, this program provides diverse research directions for students, exposing them to various fields of research and helps them decide their research interests; secondly, this program has a great staff and plenty of research resources to support students to finish their studies and achieve their future career goals.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  I presented my research project at many big international conferences and have been the recipient of many travel awards.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  I like the downtown area in Indianapolis because of the good restaurants, cafes and gift shops. I also enjoy visiting the Newfields art museum, their new exhibits and walking around their beautiful outdoor grounds.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  My research focuses on studying how lipid metabolism affects the trabecular meshwork structure and functions. Trabecular meshwork is a critical tissue which is in charge of the eye pressure, and is also a target tissue which is involved in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) pathogenesis. Currently, there is still no effective treatments for POAG in clinic, so finding the new therapeutic target is an urgent task for eye researchers. Through studying lipid metabolism in trabecular meshwork, we may provide an innovative direction in understanding the occurrence of this disease and help us design better therapeutic strategies. Outside of my research, I am also a peer-to-peer student wellness mentor and member of the medical neuroscience graduate organization and women in neuroscience group. I also currently serve on the committee for postdocs and students at ASCB. "

    "body": " The IUPUI Graduate Affairs Committee (GAC) oversees the approval of new graduate and professional degree programs, and changes to existing degrees.   ## Proposing New Programs  Specific forms and processes are used in developing new graduate and professional degree academic programs. In most cases, new programs require the involvement of the central university administration, the trustees, and the Indiana Commission for Higher Education (ICHE). The forms and general processes are similar for IU and Purdue degrees. The dean or department chair planning the new program should initially reach out to officials within the campus administration and the IU Graduate School Indianapolis to discuss the goals and need for a new degree program or certificate. Early discussions with partner programs and administrators on and off campus may be useful in new degree program development.  A pre-proposal for new programs or certificates must be submitted to academic affairs. Once approved the new program or certificate can be developed into a full proposal, which will then be submitted to the IUPUI Graduate Affairs Committee (GAC) for review. Recognizing that the review and approval process is lengthy and dependent on the schedule of IU or Purdue trustee meetings, schools requesting new programs should allow 8–12 months between school-level approval and the desired implementation of the new program for necessary campus, university, trustee, and ICHE approvals.   ## Proposing Changes to Existing Degrees  All IUPUI graduate and professional program changes require formal approval by both the school dean and the Graduate Affairs Committee. Examples of such changes include:  With the exception of converting existing on-campus academic programs to hybrid or online, program name changes, and changes to credit hours, changes to existing programs typically receive final approval once the GAC approves them. In rare instances, program or certificate changes may require additional review and approvals.  Please consult the Associate Vice Chancellor for Graduate Education for more information.  Before proposing any changes, University Graduate School programs should consult the current University Graduate School Bulletin's Policies and Procedures and Degree Requirements, which provide broad outlines of university-accepted policies.   ## Resources  [Academic Program Approval Process (IU only)](https://uap.iu.edu/academic-program-approval/index.html)  [IU Required Approval Matrix](https://uap.iu.edu/academic-program-approval/documents-resources/Academic_Approval_Matrix1.pdf)  [Purdue University Graduate Council](https://purdue.curriculog.com/)  [ICHE Policies Website](https://www.in.gov/che/policy-and-legislation/commission-policies/)   ##### The following are graduate or professional degree proposals considered for review by the IUPUI Graduate Affairs Committee  New degree programs  New degree certificates   ### New degree sub-plans  Includes tracks/concentrations/specializations and transcript notations  Accelerated or dual degrees  New degree minors   ### Curriculum changes to existing programs or academic program name change  Includes converting existing on-campus academic programs to hybrid or online.

Kafantaris   ### Ph.D. in Applied Earth Sciences  I like that Indianapolis is such a diverse place where I can interact with people from all over the world, but on the same time it holds its own traditional identity which passes in a lovely way when one interacts with the local people of Indiana.   #### Alumnus  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  It chose me. Geological reasons led me to get stranded in Texas where I started my doctoral work at UTEP for a year and a half. After that, and with the moving of my old advisor, I applied to schools in Indiana and got accepted to work with Prof. Druschel. Then I found my wife Diana, started family, have two beautiful kids, Antonios and Eleni, and soon I will be Doctor of Science as well…!  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  The fact that I can finally do the work I always dreamed of, that is playing with test tubes and bottles in the lab! In all honesty, it took me almost 4 years to understand how to work towards giving answers to the scientific questions of my project, and less than a year to actually get more than 80% of the data I have collected so far. That IS an accomplishment for me!  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  I like the Orthodox Christian communities in town because there are many of them from all over the world, so I can experience different cultures with which I share in faith. I attend St Nicholas Serbian Orthodox Church and I am the President of the Choir of my Parish.  I also like that Indianapolis is such a diverse place where I can interact with people from all over the world, but on the same time it holds its own traditional identity which passes in a lovely way when one interacts with the local people of Indiana. I am blessed to have married a Hoosier because I got to discover a lot of things about the tradition of the Midwest, especially Indiana, through my in-laws and their extended family. Indianapolis is a great place to live in, study and raise a family.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  I am investigating the thermodynamics and kinetics of the nucleophilic dissolution reaction of elemental sulfur. I form sulfur nanoparticles (S8nano) of various surface properties (hydrophilic or hydrophobic, with or without surfactant coating) and investigate how the kinetics and thermodynamics of the above reaction change under different S8nano conditions. Field analogue sites include Yellowstone National Park, US and Milos Island hydrothermal system, Aegean Sea, Greece. Various stages of this work have been presented in national and international conferences including AGU, GSA and ACS meetings, as well as local symposia (Midwest GeoBiology). The complete story on the kinetics of the above reaction was presented at 2016 AGU Annual Meeting at San Francisco, CA last December thanks to this travel grant as well as the NSF grant that supports our work.

I am from Indianapolis so it has been a great experience seeing the city grow in many ways. There are a lot of things to do from tasty restaurants, to art shows and museums.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I chose to go to IUPUI because I am from Indianapolis and it offers great programs for graduate students. I also work full time for the Indianapolis Public Library so I was really attracted to the online graduate Library Science program.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  My final paper for Public History was accepted as part of a panel presentation in January for the annual American Historical Association conference. I am ready to present because of all of the support I receive from my professors throughout the whole process of getting the proposal accepted to providing feedback on my presentation. My research focuses on an intersectional history of Indianapolis exploring the drag queen performers in popular jazz clubs along Indiana Avenue from the 1930s well into the 1970s. I really enjoy doing the research and uncovering the lives of these hidden figures which add value to the diverse history of Indianapolis.  Also, I will travel to Brazil to present a poster for the International Federation of Public History this summer. I am excited to explore and take advantage of the professional conferences and participating in them. It is a great way to network and meet other professionals in the field. My poster is in collaboration with another history grad at Howard University. This poster details how public historians can call upon the help of international volunteer organizations, like the Peace Corps, to assist in gathering information for their research. Many Peace Corps volunteers receive course credit for their service and are integrated members in their communities. When I was a Peace Corps volunteer in Paraguay, I assisted an oral historian on her research with Afro-Paraguayan women. As a trusted member of the community, I was able to introduce her to my contacts and she seamlessly conducted her interviews now part of a published book. I think this process can be replicated in many other ways.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  I really enjoy living close to downtown where I can ride my bike to class and work. I am from Indianapolis so it has been a great experience seeing the city grow in many ways. There are a lot of things to do from tasty restaurants, to art shows and museums. I really enjoy the diverse restaurants popping up along West 38th Street.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  I am the current president of Association of Library and Information Science Students (ALISS). I really enjoy leading this group because we come up with really fun activities that we can do together and relax and develop relationships with future professionals in the field. My research has spanned both fields of study on the library science side as well as the public history side. I was a research assistant for my professor in library school to determine how professional researchers are gathering their information. This is not the most glamorous study to take part in unless you are a library professional figuring out ways to make information more accessible to those who need it. So it is warming to know that I contributed in a small way to the advancement of knowledge in library science.  I worked on various exciting local history projects and even held an internship last semester in the Butler University Archives. I must say that there is nothing comparable to the hands-on experience gained at internships or shadowing someone in the field of your interest. I will add that also finding a mentor in your field is very important while in grad school. My mentor is Nichelle Hayes, the director of the Center for Black Literature and Culture for the Indianapolis Public Library and she is encouraging even when I think grad school is too hard, she pushes me to go a little further. And now I can finally see the finish line! "

I initially applied to IUPUI in 2010 for a master’s program in Biology. I chose IUPUI as the biology department here offered a thesis option for Master’s, which was not offered by a lot of other graduate programs. Upon acceptance into IUPUI, I had a phone interview with the faculty members in Biology, including Dr. Jason Meyer. I was intrigued by Dr. Meyer’s research and therefore, decided to join IUPUI and pursue my master’s degree in his lab. I really enjoyed my research project and I decided to stick around for my Ph.D., too.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  I attended my first scientific conference in 2011 and I was blown away by the hundreds of posters being presented there. Attending these conferences has helped me interact with the best scientific minds in the community and receive critical feedback to improve my research. Not only do these conferences serve as hubs to develop critical networking and presentation skills but also provide the chance to explore a different city every time!  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Indianapolis is a small trendy city and the best thing about this city are the people. When I first moved here, the biology department members and fellow students helped me immensely in getting settled in. Over the last 5 years, I have made some long-lasting friendships and professional relationships that I will always cherish. Additionally, I also enjoy living close to downtown and being able to explore different types of cuisine.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  Research description  My thesis work focuses on studying the genes involved in early retinal development. The development of the human retina begins within the first trimester of gestation and therefore, I use human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) as a system to model human development in a lab setting. hiPSCs are adult-derived stem cells that possess the ability to divide indefinitely and can generate all cell types of the body, including retinal cells. My research allows the exploration of the earliest events in embryogenesis that had been previously inaccessible and establishes iPS cells as a model system for studies of human development and disease progression.

In addition, I am fortunate to have good proximity to downtown Indianapolis, the University, and the international airport, which enables me to balance my professional and personal life with ease. In the past 4 years, Indianapolis has become a home away from home.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  I am currently actively advancing my dissertation. The overarching goal of my dissertation is to evaluate the quality of information provided to women by the mobile health apps geared towards maternal and child health. Increasingly women are using digital technologies such as mobile apps for their information needs during the prenatal period. However, along with their increasing popularity there are growing concerns regarding the quality of information provided by these apps. Considering the ubiquity of mobile phones and the increased usage of healthcare apps for information seeking and disease self-management, this study has important implications mainly due to the fact that the mobile health environment is highly unregulated. My excellent panel of mentors, namely Dr. Christopher Harle, Dr. Joshua Vest and Dr. Brian Dixon, are providing me with invaluable inputs and are actively guiding me through this process  Academic Awards:  University Participations: "

    "body": "  # Tong  Wu   ### Ph.D. Cellular and Integrative Physiology  I heard about Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM) through U.S. News when applying to graduate school in the USA. I discovered that IUSM is a pioneer in cancer, immunology, pediatrics, hematology, and metabolic diseases research.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I heard about Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM) through U.S. News when applying to graduate school in the USA. I discovered that IUSM is a pioneer in cancer, immunology, pediatrics, hematology, and metabolic diseases research. IUSM’s Indiana BioMedical Gateway (IBMG) program provides diversified rotation opportunities during the first 2 years of enrollment, which allowed me to gain a better understanding of available research opportunities in the different medical research departments and which is most suitable for me. In addition, IUSM strongly supports international students to ensure that they can pursue their career and research goals freely without concerns of living abroad.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  My favorite academic accomplishment is participating in the first Annual Milestone Celebration and Banquet held by the IUSM graduate office this year with my mentor, Christie Orschell, who supports me a lot in my research work. Other favorite academic accomplishments are the opportunities to present my research at different scientific research societies, such as Radiation Research Society and American Society of Hematology, communicating with other investigators in similar fields of research, and contributing to our scientific community as best as I can.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  I like the diversified cultural environment in the downtown area of Indianapolis. There are many cultural festivals and entertainment parades, such as the Indy 500 festival parade held in May of each year, which is my first recommendation to my friends who want to visit Indy. Also, Indianapolis is a big city, but without the ‘hectic and chaotic’ life like other metropoles. Strolling or jogging along the canal walk when I feel tired from research is really a refreshing activity. It is a perfect city to live and do research.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  I am working in Dr. Orschell’s lab. My research involves our novel murine model of the hematopoietic acute radiation syndrome and delayed effects of acute radiation exposure for efficacy testing of potential medical countermeasures against these two syndromes. Our data show that prostaglandin, a hematopoietic stem cell survival agent, not only increases the survival rate of irradiated mice, but also relieves long-term thymus involution and subsequent immune suppression that is a serious problem for survivors of acute radiation exposure, as well as those receiving radiotherapy for cancer treatment.  There are many other activities I have participated in as a graduate student in IUPUI. I heard about these activities through Jagnews email, such as the volunteer services at Damar Services Center and Ronald McDonald House, the IUPUI International Program to experience a true American holiday with an American family, and the IUPUI History Month Events, which presents frequent seminars from different perspectives to help us know what has happened and is happening in our society.

Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  The Lilly Family School of Philanthropy offers the best program in Philanthropic Studies, and I knew it would set me up for success in the nonprofit sector. Plus, the location in downtown Indianapolis, on the IUPUI campus made the choice so easy for me!  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  I have loved being able to apply what I’m learning in the classroom directly towards what I’m doing in my internships and work. Sometimes, it’s a unique perspective I can bring to the table at a committee meeting, and once, I had a work assignment to write a particular kind of solicitation letter – and I had just written one for a class the week before – so I could literally use my homework assignment in my work environment. How cool is that?  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  I love the mix of urban and natural life around downtown – the canal and green space right next to cool restaurants and major buildings. I’m always discovering something new here!  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  My first year, I was a Graduate Assistant at the St. Vincent Foundation, which serves a major hospital system in Indiana. I worked directly with supervisors to plan presentations, prepare solicitation letters, and coordinate details for major events.  Over the summer, I had an internship with Gleaners Food Bank, and I got to create a fundraising program for them to help reach lower- and mid-level donors more effectively. I got to treat that experience like an experiment, trying different ways to engage donors (from phone calls, postcards, and event invitations) to see which people preferred, and which strategy raised more money.  This year, my Graduate Assistantship is with The Fund Raising School, which is the top provider of professional development for professional fundraisers – and they’re housed at IUPUI in the Lilly Family School of Philanthropy, too! I am doing marketing work for them, managing their social media presence, designing their annual course directory, and finding new ways for them to reach more prospective students.  The School also helped me find a work-study position before I came to campus, and I ended up working for Lake Institute on Faith & Giving, which researches and provides professional development for religious leaders about fundraising. They’re also housed on campus with the IU Lilly Family School of Philanthropy. Over the last two years, I’ve been doing administrative and marketing work for them, which has been really fun. All of these experiences have made me so much more prepared for post-grad life! "

I was initially drawn to Herron School of Art and Design’s Art Therapy master’s program for the leadership. I attended a grad open house during undergrad and was inspired by the passion I saw from Juliet King and Eileen Misluk. In addition, art therapy is a relative new field in the state of Indiana and Juliet’s call for pioneers spoke to me!  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  By far, my favorite academic accomplishment was having the opportunity to work with the Indiana University Health Neuroscience Center staff on a collaborative capstone study. We are working on a publication submission as we speak! It was great to see these seemingly divergent fields of study (art and medicine) work in tandem to further our understanding of art and neuroscience with implications for art therapy.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  I absolutely love Indianapolis’ Canal Walk. This beautiful place merges art with the great outdoors and is very close to IUPUI’s campus! I have always enjoyed the art and culture of Indianapolis.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  For the past two-years I have been interning at St. Vincent Health, working with patients, caregivers, and staff individually and in groups in both in- and out-patient settings. In transition from my first-year internship to my second-year placement, our goal was to better integrate art therapy into the medical setting and expand our service net. Currently, I service patients from the Cancer Care and Supportive Care departments, Peyton Manning Children’s Hospital, and Women’s High Risk.  In terms of research, I have been in collaboration with Herron’s Art Therapy Program Director, Juliet King; fellow cohort member, Alex Shaikh; neurophysiologist, Leisha Osburn; IU Health Neuroscience Center’s Dr. Robert Pascuzzi and Dr. Dragos Sabau; and IUPUI statistician, Dr. Fang Li on an EEG protocol titled: Cortical Activity Patterns in Art Making vs. Fine Motor Movement as Measured by EEG. We expect to find statistically significant variances in cortical activation, which will lead to an increased scientific understanding of the creative process, will contribute to research on the intersection of the sciences and arts research, and will provide a framework for how clinical art therapy theories and interventions can be further tested and understood.  I have also collaborated with Juliet King, Greg Hull, Gwen Sprehn, Sandra Guingrich, Alex Shaikh, and Robert Pascuzzi on and ALS protocol titled: BRIDGE-A Clinical Study to Improve the Quality of Life in Patients and Families Affected by ALS.

I completed my Bachelor’s degree here at IUPUI with Energy Engineering, so experiencing first-hand how intensive and thorough the education that the IUPUI Engineering department provides also drove me to pursue my graduate degree here. In addition, IUPUI established the Industrial Assessment Center, a program that is sponsored by US Department of Energy. At the IAC, we conduct energy audits for manufacturing companies, which provides a great learning environment and hands on experience for students. IUPUI is one of the 24 different universities in the nation that carry the IAC program. Finally, working with Dr. Jie Chen, Dr. Ali Razban and Dr. David Goodman during my undergraduate studies encouraged me to apply to graduate school and stay at IUPUI knowing that they would be my advisors.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  Now that I have been at IUPUI for five years, I have worked on many interesting and great projects that I am proud of. However, I think my favorite accomplishment would be winning the Elite 50 Award.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  The first aspect of Indianapolis that resonated with me was that it immediately felt like home. Moving from Abu Dhabi at the age of 17 was a big step in my life. Here in Indy, I met great people and made amazing friendships. I will always think of it as a second home.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  I am currently the lead engineer of the Industrial Assessment Center. My job is to oversee all the assessment projects and monitor the progress, collect issues from audits and report to the directors, conduct energy assessments, work on center related projects, and interview and train newly hired engineers.  Additionally, my thesis is focused on industrial air compressors. The research includes improving efficiency and optimizing operation.  Through an undergraduate project, I had the opportunity to work with a team of engineers for the Indianapolis City County Building to try to achieve its environmentally-friendly status. Thanks to this, I also had the honor of becoming an accredited associate of the international Leadership in Energy Environmental Design (LEED), which is an organization dedicated to developing green buildings.

I wanted to join a graduate program that would not only provide me with exceptional training to become an independent investigator but would also be a good support system and an advocate for my training experience. The administrative staff of IU School of Medicine Indiana BioMedical Gateway (IBMG) program have been an amazing resource. I knew they would make sure I had access to resources and opportunities I needed to successfully matriculate and get through my PhD training. Their enthusiasm and dedication shared with students is also apparent in faculty and student interactions. Even before joining the Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, it was very evident that the faculty cared about graduate student development and learning. I could sense all of this from the very beginning, and I knew this was the right program for me.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  My favorite academic accomplishment thus far was being selected to participate in and completing the Cold Spring Harbor Workshop on Pancreatic Cancer in Cold Spring Harbor, NY, which was made possible by an award from the Lustgarten Foundation and support from a supplement grant from the NIH. I was able to participate in a workshop which covered both advances and the current state of pancreatic cancer research as well as interact with and learn from leaders in the field from all around the US and Canada. Having an opportunity to attend this workshop was a life changing experience in terms of my academic training.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  What I like most about living in Indianapolis is the food. There are so many great restaurants with foods from different cultures. And I think we also have some of the best food trucks here.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  My lab works on pancreatic cancer. We use genetically engineered mouse models to study the progression of the disease. Pancreatic cancer currently has an 8-9% survival rate, and patients often present late and with advanced, metastatic disease. My projects have involved using the CRISPR-Cas9 technology to study the effect of a transcription factor in the TGF-β signaling pathway, and it’s involvement in the epithelial to mesenchymal transition phenomenon, which has been linked to cancer metastasis. I also am working on a murine model of pancreatic cancer to better understand the role of a tumor suppressor in regulating pancreatic cancer cell metastasis. "

I also love the atmosphere living on campus, I truly feel like it’s my second home away from home. Additionally, I like how easy it is to travel downtown from campus for shopping, or just to get away and explore.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I heard about IUPUI through a Dean that I met in my home country Antigua while working as a counselor for the Royal Police Force of Antigua & Barbuda Youth Intervention Unit. She was presenting at a conference and she eventually told me about IUPUI. I came to visit IUPUI in a program called Getting You into IUPUI and fell in love with the campus. I feel like IUPUI is truly the best of two worlds - campus life, with a dash of city adventure which is perfect for me. Additionally, I was very fortunate to receive a scholarship that I couldn’t turn down… and the rest is history.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  First and foremost, I am an international student from the beautiful twin island nation state of Antigua & Barbuda. I am also a first generation college student and have maintained a 4.0 GPA for my entire first year of graduate school while working in IUPUI’s Office for Diversity Access & Achievement. This is a huge achievement for me personally. This is my very first experience of living in the US, attending school, working on campus and interning all at the same time. For me, it is truly a humbling feeling to have made it thus far as the only Antiguan student in the IU School of Social Work program to date, and I intend to make my family and country very proud.

Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  As a graduate student, I successfully completed my very first practicum at the Civil Practice Clinic (ILSWC). The Civil Practice Clinic is an Interdisciplinary Law and Social Work Clinic (ILSWC) located in Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law. In this clinic, I worked closely with a law student on cases to providing social services to low-income clients. Currently, I am enrolled in my second practicum at Thomas D. Gregg Elementary School 15 where I work closely with the School Social Worker to provide social services to students and their families at the school. I feel that this practicum has been the most rewarding thus far, and I look forward to helping more children and families in need through direct assistance and various partnerships with community stakeholders.  Additionally, I was involved in two student governments on campus, the Graduate and Professional Student Government (GPSG) and The Underrepresented Professional and Graduate Student Organization (UPnGO) as their secretary. Earlier in the year, as a member of the IUPUI International Club I gave a cultural presentation about my home country, Antigua & Barbuda, and was the first student to do this at IUPUI. I made some of my country’s national dishes, and taught students how to dance to a soca song called ‘Old Time Something’ by one of my very own Antiguan Soca artist known as ‘Boasta’. Presently, as a Graduate Assistant for Outreach in the Office for Diversity & Academic Enrichment I have the opportunity to work along with Undergraduate Admissions to organize campus visits for various youth organizations and high schools that would like to visit IUPUI. This has been a very exciting job as I am able to interact with young people frequently while helping them think about their academic future and attending college. "

Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I chose graduate school at IUPUI because the professors I met during my search were very motivated and looking to make a very strong impact on their research fields. I felt that the fast-paced ambitious environment of a newer university trying to establish itself in name with the help of larger well-established universities such as Purdue University would help me find the resources and fellow researchers that would help me grow my potential in the way I was looking for. I also enjoyed the middle-sized campus feel and enjoyed that IUPUI was in the center of the city I grew up in. (I grew up in the eastside of Indianapolis).  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  Publishing my first research and perspective articles in two-dimensional transition metal carbides, known as MXenes, was by far my favorite accomplishments. I have grown to care quite a bit about these materials as this research area has become my professional passion, and it felt very rewarding to publish a new research insight and perspective on these materials as it felt like my own way to push the foundational knowledge in this field further than it had previously been.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Indianapolis is a great mid-size city to live in as it has many of the big-city vibes of sports, night life, and city-wide events without the traffic, long commutes, or giant crowds. Indianapolis and the surrounding area is especially great for myself and my fiancée, as we have plenty of places to go visit on the weekend or take our two dogs on a walk without needing to drive too far!  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  Research: My research pertains to the mechanical and high temperature properties of nanomaterials, specifically two-dimensional transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides, which are commonly known as MXenes. My specific passion is in researching the fundamental behaviors of the mechanical properties and high-temperature transformations of MXenes composed of different transition metal and/or carbon/nitrogen. My fellowship through the Department of Defense pertains specifically to exploring the fundamental mechanical behavior of MXenes with different transition metals, carbon/nitrogen, number of atomic layers, and surface terminations.  Activities: In the lab, one of my passions is mentoring undergraduate students. At this point in my graduate career, I have found that my professional passion is researching the fundamental behavior of MXene nanomaterials, but before attending IUPUI I did not know that I had that passion. Most undergraduate students are in the same position I was in before my graduate studies, where the groundwork for research passion is there but the students have not yet experienced research. I greatly enjoy mentoring undergraduates and showing them that their passions for new learning can be turned into pushing the limits of what mankind as a whole knows about the world we live in.  Outside of research activities, I care a lot about making science an accessible career field for all people in the world. Unfortunately, in our world today true scientific knowledge and exploration is locked within higher education, where the admittance into these universities depends a lot on an individual’s background, opportunities, location, and financial situation from where they are born. In addition, when I was growing up, I found that scientific knowledge is often spread through basic fact memorization for standardized tests and is not experienced as the hands-on trial and error reality that it is. My non-research professional goal is to develop programs/experiences that can expand access to the sciences to all young students regardless of their background so that they can experience the concepts at a young age when they are still learning about the world. To do this, I proposed, started, and am currently the graduate mentor for a multi-disciplinary research team comprised of computer information graphics technology and mechanical engineering students to develop an augmented reality (AR) educational iPad application about nanoscience and nanotechnology tailored for young elementary students. The long-term goal of this project is to create an educational and interactive app experience to expand into the Indianapolis area and provide a method for Indianapolis Public Schools (IPS) and metropolitan Indianapolis elementary school teachers to teach nanoscience and nanotechnology to students as young as first grade. I believe that if young students are exposed to otherwise university-level education at ages as young as 6-7, it will prime them to become passionate researchers in nanoscience and nanotechnology concepts early in their lives to become the future leaders of the research field in their later careers.  Outside of work/research, I greatly enjoy taking my fiancée and my small dogs to places in Indianapolis and the outside area and going to different local events and/or nature parks for hikes. If I can’t be found at IUPUI, I can definitely be found doing this with my fiancée!  Brian was recently awarded the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship. "

I am incredibly passionate about Forensic Science and when I read about the work that Dr. Susan Walsh and her collaborators were doing, I knew I wanted to be a part of that kind of advancement in the field. Her research is really what drew me to IUPUI and helped me to solidify my choice in pursuing my graduate degree here.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  My favorite accomplishment thus far has been the opportunity to present my work at the International Symposium on Human Identification.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  I really enjoy the fact that I can live in the suburbs outside the city, but it only takes me about 20 minutes to drive to about any place inside Indianapolis. The accessibility of both small town and city life is wonderful.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  In our laboratory we work on Forensic DNA phenotyping, which means that we look at the genes and SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) that cause your externally visible characteristics in order to develop forensic tools that allow us to predict what an individual looks like from a sample left at a crime scene. Currently, with the prediction tools developed by Dr. Walsh and her collaborators we can predict and individual’s hair, eye, and skin color, but we hope to one day be able to produce and actual physical print out of what the person looks like.  While in the Walsh Laboratory I have helped to establish our phenotyping database of over 2200 samples in which we can continuing to collect for as well. My thesis work focuses on improving these phenotyping tools and applying them to Next Generation Sequencing through the Illumina Miseq through custom assays. I also work to apply these tools to casework through an established collaboration with the Indiana State Police.  Krystal is also a recipient of the IUPUI Travel Fellowship award.

    "body": "  # Khrisma  McMurray   ### Masters in Library and Information Science  The community here at IUPUI is what made me want to stay here for my graduate degree because every university has their own accolades but not every university has a community committed to their student’s personal growth along with their academic achievements.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I have been at IUPUI since 2017. After getting my undergraduate degree, I had created a community on this campus that I cherish. IUPUI is renowned for their research and academics but for me it was my peers, faculty, staff, and various mentors on this campus that made me feel safe and uplifted emotionally and mentally as I finished my studies. The community here at IUPUI is what made me want to stay here for my graduate degree because every university has their own accolades but not every university has a community committed to their student’s personal growth along with their academic achievements.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  My favorite academic accomplishment so far has been switching master’s programs. Going to and graduating from college is hard enough as an African American woman because we have to be twice as good to be considered half as great. I started my graduate journey in a program that I thought I was interested in, but after taking a few classes, I realized it did not resonate with my interests and career goals as much as I thought. Instead of continuing in that program, just to say I did it or dropping out, I decided that another program might be a better fit for me. I switched and started taking classes in the School of Informatics and Computing, where I found my home in the Library and Information Science program. It is important for me to not only receive a graduate degree but receive a degree that I would enjoy and use in the future. I also think it’s good for people to know that not every program is going to be aligned with your interests, but the right grad program is out there.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  I love how Indianapolis has continued to grow and innovate. We are truly in the world’s largest smallest city. There are opportunities everywhere. There is always something to do professionally or just for fun.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  During the summer of 2022, I was a Junior Fellow within the Library of Congress. I worked in the Informal Learning Office, which exists to connect kids, teens, and families to the collections and resources of the Library by developing programs, resources, and learning spaces that inspire them to use the Library for their own creative purposes. During my internship, I contributed to the content of the new Southwest Corridor, a new 5,700 square foot experiential learning space in the Library of Congress’ Thomas Jefferson Building. The Southwest Corridor will be a user-driven, flexible, and participatory space for intergenerational family groups and school groups, with a focus on ages 9-13. While visitors of all ages will be given the chance to open-explore curated replicas of Library collections, visitors will also have an opportunity to dive deeper by exploring discovery boxes, which will be a core component of the experience. In my role, I developed content for a prototype of two primary source “quest/discovery boxes” based on the Library’s vast collection.  I also self-published a children's book, Precious Love . Because my graduate program is virtual, its flexibility helped me balance time between school and my personal life. I have been able to use what I learned in my undergraduate and graduate courses here at IUPUI to write my book, which is about being in a blended family and dealing with an absentee father. Ultimately, Precious Love teaches children how to move forward when someone in their life has left them behind.

Being the crossroads of the United States, it is easy to navigate through other midwestern states. I have taken trips to states like Kentucky, Ohio, Illinois, and Michigan at different intervals.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  The Lilly Family School of Philanthropy is the first and the best school of philanthropy in the world. It offered what I wanted as a nonprofit professional who returned to school for additional knowledge, and of course, the scholarship offer was irresistible.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  I have a lot of favorite accomplishments at IUPUI. Primarily, as an international student from Nigeria, being able to settle quickly into the new learning environment and consistently maintained a minimum of 3.6/4.0 GPA throughout the graduate school is one. I also won the Graduate and Professional Educational Grants (G-PEG), a research/travel grant in 2016 and the 2017 Lilly Family School of Philanthropy Alumni Association Scholarship. I have just been accepted as a lifetime member of the Nu Lambda Mu International Honor Society and recently named one of the ‘Elite 50’ and ‘Premier 10’ out of 8,100 graduate and professional students on IUPUI campus for leadership and engagement. For me, it is truly a humbling feeling to have made it thus far as an international student, mom to a 4-year old, employee and socially responsible in my community.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Indianapolis is awesome for the family. Being the crossroads of the United States, it is easy to navigate through other midwestern states. I have taken trips to states like Kentucky, Ohio, Illinois, and Michigan at different intervals. I also love the fact that Indianapolis has something for everyone. I spent the last nine months working from Downtown-Indy and has visited several interesting places. From the museums to the zoo, shopping malls, canal, and cool restaurants (thanks to my Lumina folks). The list is endless, everyone should explore Indianapolis!  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  As a graduate student at the Lilly Family School of Philanthropy, it is expected that students gain hands-on professional experience while studying to help connect classroom theories to professional practice. In my first year, I worked remotely with the American Red Cross-National Headquarters in Washington DC, where I assisted the Foundation and Partnerships team to develop foundation-specific resources for 350 relationship managers. In my second year, I moved to Lumina Foundation for Education, downtown-Indianapolis and worked on a variety of assignments that will improve post-secondary attainment in America. I specifically supported the Director of the office of the president and organizational development and the Strategic Impact team. I was also fortunate to work as a summer research assistant for the 2016 Coutts Million Dollar Donor Report. Finally, I represented the Lilly Family School of Philanthropy at the Graduate and Professional Student Government, featured on InspireIUPUI and supported the hosting of the Mandela-Washington Fellowship for Young African Leaders (YALI) on IUPUI campus among other engagements.

I turned down full-time employment in the sustainability field in California to come back home to Indiana for my SPEA training.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  After graduating with my MS from the University of Dayton, I knew I wanted to pursue a career in sustainability in higher education. Because of this, I sought programs that complemented my graduate degree in ecology. I found SPEA’s Urban Sustainability program tied in nicely to my previous training while also providing me with new skillsets outside of science, specifically in policy and economics. I was also lucky enough to receive a scholarship to pay for my IUPUI graduate education.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  I’m most proud of the collaborative projects I’ve been able to work on both in my capacity as a SPEA graduate student and the Director of Sustainability at IUPUI. I’m currently working with a SPEA graduate capstone class to complete a greenhouse gas assessment of the university. Utilizing the university as a “living laboratory” allows students to hone their skills and network with university personnel, all while bettering the campus infrastructure. It is my hope that this level of assessment will be utilized to create greenhouse gas reduction goals for IUPUI in the future.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Indianapolis has all the benefits of a big city while maintaining the character of a small-town community. I really enjoy the people and opportunity to get involved. Folks are incredibly friendly and willing to collaborate, which makes the work that much more enjoyable. I also appreciate how personally invested people are in bettering their city; there’s a tangible sense of ownership.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  Coming to IUPUI was a complete leap of faith. I turned down full-time employment in the sustainability field in California to come back home to Indiana for my SPEA training. As luck would have it, that leap of faith paid off. Shortly after enrolling with SPEA, I was hired as Assistant Director of the Center for Earth and Environmental Science (CEES) at IUPUI. I stayed in that position for nearly a year before I landed my dream job – Director of Sustainability at IUPUI. If it hadn’t been for SPEA, there is a 0% chance I would be where I am now, and I’ve worked diligently to collaborate heavily with SPEA in my capacity as director. In addition to the greenhouse gas assessment, we have two graduate students doing research on food waste policy for the campus and city, worked with environmentally-centric non-profits to create an innovative internship model for SPEA students, hosted two big Earth Month events in collaboration with SPEA, and are looking to create a fellowship program for students with interest in sustainability.  I’m also proud of our partnership with the Indiana Sports Corporation to make athletic events in Indianapolis more sustainable. This summer, IUPUI will be hosting the first zero waste Olympic event in the world. This effort has included stakeholders from across campus and the city, including a Herron School of Art + Design visual communications class; these students are designing all of the print and digital media to communicate zero waste to fans and athletes.  I’m incredibly grateful I chose IUPUI’s SPEA program over California. The program has paved the way for my professional career and taught me the importance of dedicating my skills to entities that need it most. "

What’s been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here? Publishing my first first-author research paper in our society’s journal, Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics is my favorite academic accomplishment. Prior to graduate school and after starting, it seemed pretty unanimous that papers, but especially first-author papers, were really important for receiving funding, jobs, etc., so my very first one was a time for celebration.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis? I enjoy that Indianapolis has all the perks of a big city, without the big city environment (traffic). There is everything to do here! Professional and amateur sports, music, cultural and food festivals, museums, great restaurants and so much more.

Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I grew up in Brownsburg, Indiana and went to IU Bloomington for my undergraduate education. I knew I wanted to be close to home for grad school, but still have the feel of being in a city where change takes place. IUPUI is a great fit for me- I am close to my family while also being near the Statehouse and other government agencies- perfect for a J.D./M.S.W. student interested in using my degrees to serve others and advocate for social justice.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  This year, I organized an event called “A Network Fair for Service Providers.” Approximately 125 service providers from a wide-range of sectors in the community came together to educate each other on the services they provide. Specifically, attendees included agencies that serve children, veterans, and the homeless population, along with government agencies, legal aid agencies, health agencies, and many more. The underlying belief of this event was that clients are better served by systems that appreciate and understand each other; allowing them to make more effective referrals. This Network Fair served as a platform to learn more about the services being provided in the Indianapolis area, increase collaboration, encourage partnerships, and ultimately enhance services to clients.  The event was a great success- Of 40 surveys completed, all 40 either \"agree\" or \"strongly agree\" that they know more about services being provided in the Indianapolis area as a result of this event. All 40 respondents either \"agree\" or \"strongly agree\" that they know how they can collaborate with organizations they met today and 39 out of 40 respondents indicate they will follow-up with at least one organization they met at the Fair.  It was very exciting to be able to see a need in my community, come up with a plan to address that need, and execute an event successfully that worked to alleviate that need.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Life in Indianapolis is never dull! From exploring restaurants and bars on Massachusetts Avenue to attending important events at the Indiana Supreme Court- it has a little bit of something for everyone. Every single weekend there is something to do- whether that be a band at Old National Center, a play at the IRT, a major sporting event, a coffee shop to visit, and so much more. Indianapolis is a great place in which to learn, meet people, and play- absolutely perfect for young professionals.

Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  IUPUI offered the exact program that I wanted for an affordable price. The Lilly Family School of Philanthropy is the only school of philanthropy in the United States and was the first in the world. It is, by all metrics, the best program of its kind, and it is right here in Indiana. As I went to Bloomington for my undergraduate degree, staying in the state for my graduate education was an easy choice. The professors at the School of Philanthropy are both talented lecturers and elite researchers, so I knew that I would receive a top-rate education and learn the latest theory and technique in every class I took.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  The great thing about a graduate program is how quickly the academic accomplishments stack up. It is hard to pinpoint just one favorite, but I would have to say the most exciting thing I have accomplished is being awarded a scholarship, provided by Leon Logothetis of the Human Interaction Project, to travel internationally and volunteer. This means I can directly apply my academic and practical training to a project of some significance. I have just been accepted into a citizen photojournalism program where I will travel to Ghana and investigate child labor through interviews and photography. And it was the culmination of over a year of intense graduate study that made it possible for me to be bestowed with this transformational opportunity.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Indianapolis has virtually every amenity of the big city without all the people and traffic. I have never been a city person, but after living in Indianapolis I can see the appeal of the small city. The downtown offers a huge number of arts and culture opportunities as well as some first-rate eating and drinking. If you like sports, Indianapolis is also a great place to live, and I can travel down to B-Town whenever I want to tailgate or catch a basketball game. Combine that with the legendary Hoosier Hospitality, and you have one of the best places to live this side of the Mississippi. Although I might leave the state after graduation, there will always be a pull back to Indy now that I have experienced what it is like to live here.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  I am a student of philanthropic studies, a multidisciplinary field where you can be a practitioner, a researcher, or a combination of the two. As I am interested in Higher Education fundraising to provide scholarships and access to underrepresented minorities, women entering STEM fields, and support for first generation students, I have accepted positions that will give me tools to understand the sector and jump right in when I graduate.  My first year, I was a graduate intern for the Study Abroad Office and worked on a project to inform students of all the costs associated with study abroad so they could more easily plan and save. For the last thirteen months, I have also applied my knowledge of grants and fellowship to serve as the Graduate Assistant for Graduate Mentoring and Grant Writing with the Graduate School. I am also serving as the Graduate Assistant to the Dean of the Lilly Family School of Philanthropy, a position which affords me great freedom to explore and put into practice much of the theory surrounding my degree program. Finally, I have also started consulting for various nonprofits and public charities, again putting what I learn in my graduate program into practice. "

    "body": "  # Drashty  Paresh Mody   ### Doctor of Dental Surgery (D.D.S./Ph.D.)  I am not the person to thrive in a hustle and bustle of a busy city but also not the person you will find posing in the middle of a creek. I like how Indy offers a happy medium of this spectrum: liveliness of a city while being close to nature.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  As an immigrant student who started high school in the USA, I had very little knowledge of higher education systems in this country. When I started my undergraduate education, I enrolled in classes and activities that exposed me to various aspects of a career in dentistry. After having a very positive and impactful undergraduate research experience, I researched institutes that emphasized oral health research along with optimum clinical training for aspiring dentists. Indiana University School of Dentistry fit right into these parameters. Unlike medicine, dental research is not an active part of the curriculum due to the limited time students have to master the rigorous didactic and clinical skillset. Hence, being accepted to an institution that provides an environment for students like myself to pursue science curiosities and get first-hand experience with translational research is truly a dream come true. Being an out-of-state student does come with responsibility of being financially conscious when deciding on a graduate program; however, IU Dentistry and by extension, IUPUI, has welcomed my current ideas and future aspirations and continues to provide all necessary guidance in my path of becoming a dentist-scientist.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  My favorite academic accomplishments sort of build off each other. In 2021, I was encouraged to apply for advancing my research interests by taking a year off from dental school and joining the Medical Research Scholars Program (MRSP) at the NIH. The same year, I was the only student representative on our IU Dentistry Research Day Planning committee and took on the challenge of co-hosting the event with another faculty member. Both opportunities were a first for me and the institution. To my excitement and utter disbelief, I was selected as the first dental student from IU Dentistry to join the MRSP fellowship and was the only dental student in our cohort of 50 medical/dental/veterinary medicine students. And, I was also the first student to host the annual IU Dentistry Research Day in April of 2021. Reflecting back, both of these opportunities gave me the affirmation and courage to understand that I have what it takes to be a trailblazer and establish a new normal at my institution. One of the core values of IU Dentistry’s Mission Statement is to train oral care providers who are critical thinkers and lifelong learners. My two accomplishments are the living examples of IU Dentistry’s commitment to their mission. I am the first female in my family to pursue a career in the healthcare field, and I am hopeful that I am certainly not the last. I strongly believe that academic accomplishments are more fruitful when they bring a sustainable impact for you and others around you.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Moving from Virginia to Indiana was exciting, bittersweet, and nerve-wracking all at the same time. When I first moved to the new city, I had packed more dreams and fears than my all of luggage. Dreams of becoming the first doctor in my family, doing groundbreaking research at the dental school and making someone smile brighter. Those dreams were surrounded with fears of being able to fulfill my parents’ expectations, surviving independent living and starting from square one. However, Indianapolis, with all its rain and sunshine, embraced me with all of my physical and emotional baggage. I have lived in the city for a little over two years and I have already formed a deep connection with Indy. I am not the person to thrive in a hustle and bustle of a busy city but also not the person you will find posing in the middle of a creek. I like how Indy offers a happy medium of this spectrum: liveliness of a city while being close to nature. I have not explored all parts of Indy; however, through volunteering and participating in public health measures, I have been very impressed with the hospitality and diversity of the city. Whether its walking on Massachusetts Avenue for ice cream from Kilwin’s or going to Crawfordsville to volunteer at the Student Outreach Clinic, there are so many stories along the way and so many new friends to make. Indy is truly a one-of-a-kind city, ready to welcome you; all you have to do is be ready to sing in the rain, dance in the sunshine and spread your palms to collect snowflakes!  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  As a DDS/PhD student, I am working on a collaborative project with two mentors, Dr. Simone Duarte at IU School of Dentistry and Dr. Jacqueline Mays at NIH/NIDCR. My research is housed in the Oral Immunobiology field where I am studying salivary gland proteomics in context of oral chronic graft vs. host disease and how the changes in site specific immunity impacts the oral microbiome. Ultimately, the goal of my project is to develop a validated biomarker panel for future clinical trials that predicts the disease status in a patient friendly way through analyzing the saliva profiles. When I am not pipetting in my labs, I love to dance and embroider. To keep up with my manual dexterity, I experiment with baking desserts from all around the world, but mostly inspired by the Great British Bake off. My core value as a student, leader and healthcare professional is service. I have served as the President and Community service chair for our student chapter of American Association of Public Health Dentistry at IU Dentistry and have helped planned oral education/screenings at local Headstart schools and Special Olympics events. In addition, I have also served as student study coach to help my peers with didactic lectures and study strategies to integrate problem-solving based learning while at dental school. I also helped lead mindful practices through our student wellness coalition at dental school by teaching some yoga workshops and partnering with IU Medicine to promote interprofessional mental health care. I am an active advocate for research and love sharing my knowledge with diverse set of audience to help bridge the gap between science and societies. "

Cancer research is close to home for me. My desire to undertake clinically relevant cancer research was a major catalyst in my decision to pursue a career in cancer research at Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM) as a Ph.D. student. The IUSM at IUPUI has an impressive reputation as a leader in multidisciplinary cancer research, boasting facilities such as the Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute, Simon Canter Center (an NCI-designated Cancer Center), and a myriad of state-of-the-art Core facilities. The ability to work closely with these facilities matched well with my interests to be in a collaborative, team-based environment like IUPUI, and I was prompted to rotate in and ultimately join Dr. Tao Lu’s lab. Based on Dr. Lu’s track record, I was confident I would be provided with a strong foundation in the molecular techniques pertinent to the cancer research field that would advance me to the next step of my career. Furthermore, in terms of location, Indianapolis was an attractive city; it offered a good balance of affordable and comfortable living, with just the right amount of fun activities to do on the weekends.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  While at IU, I have been so blessed and honored with several academic accomplishments. Additionally, I have had so many amazing opportunities to engage with and give back to my community, which is very personal to me. My favorite accomplishments have been the intra- and extra-mural travel awards and fellowships I have received to represent IU and present my research at several conferences throughout the US. My favorite accomplishment is the prestigious American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Scholar-in-Training Award supported by the Colon Cancer Coalition. Scholar-in-Training Awards are highly competitive and are presented to those with high-quality applications from a large global candidate pool. I was also honored to recently receive the 2018 Graduate Student Volunteer of the Year Award and 2018 Excellence in Basic Science Research Award from IUSM.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  I would have to say Indy is the ideal graduate student living spot. It has many of the incentives of big city living such as numerous eateries, entertainment, sports and night life activities. For instance, anytime I have a craving for a specific cuisine I can always find it amongst a wide variety of restaurant choices downtown or in the nearby Broad Ripple area. As an outdoorsy soul, it also offers me some of perks of suburban living including hiking trails, paddle-boating on the Canal, kayaking at Eagle Creek, to name a few. In short, there’s always something to do in Indy, whatever my interests are on any given day. The biggest perk is that Indy has one of the lowest costs of living among large cities in the nation which allows me to live affordably downtown and have a short commute to campus. I also love the fact that Indy has grown into a vivacious place that attracts people of all ages, nationalities and walks of life, providing me with opportunities to network through outreach and professional events all over the city and learn about various cultures.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  For the past 4 years, I have been able to work with cell and mouse models of colorectal cancer wherein we identified how posttranslational modifications of two proteins, YBX1 and PRMT5 significantly contribute to colorectal cancer malignancy by activating specific cancer cell survival signaling pathways. My ultimate goal is to use my findings to develop more effective therapeutic strategies and to improve the survival and quality of life for cancer patients. Thus far, my graduate work has resulted in 8 peer-reviewed publications for which I am extremely grateful to my mentor, Dr. Tao Lu as well as the IUSM Graduate Division for cultivating an excellent personal and professional training environment for me. I am also very grateful for the ability to fulfill my dual passion for outreach and leadership which have led me to hold several positions on and off campus including: Vice President of the IUPUI Graduate & Professional Student Government; Graduate Student Representative of the IUSM Pharmacology & Toxicology Department; tutor kids at the Julian Center with School on Wheels; mentor at-risk girls with Big Brother Big Sister of Central Indiana; and participate in Science Outreach Activities at local elementary schools.

My focus of study at the moment has to do with how the way in which we frame what Writing Centers do and, more importantly, what we choose to leave out of that frame, impacts how we perceive our own value and how our value is perceived by others. It is construction of our perceived value which we are implicit in that contributes to the oppression women, Liberal Arts Majors, and Writing Centers. Within the patriarchal culture and product-driven Academy, the Writing Center is capable of drawing on the feminization narrative for its strength as a place of process over production. By embracing our sex politics, using our skills as interpreters, and putting a stop to self-deprecating rhetoric, the Writing Center and its professionals can break the cycle caused by the current Writing Center grand narrative and come to a place where it can demand the value it is worth. In doing so, I hope to change the way that liberal arts schools are seen and talked about and advocate that liberal artists deserve to be valued and funded just as other disciplines. "

I had been doing some personal research for ways to innovate my live music performance. Eventually I was told I should talk with Dr. Scott Deal. I met with him and from our conversation I could tell that he and the department were thinking about many similar concepts and ideas for directions to take music technology.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  My concepts often lose credibility because I can’t seem to focus in on just one aspect at a time. Of course, I still have this problem and I’m continuing to learn ways around it. However I’m far more aware of the nuances that, one way or the other push others over the edge in how they perceive your idea.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Indianapolis has a lot going for it. There are top-notch musical events almost every night, and so many down-to-earth people.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  I’ve been working as a research assistant for Dr. Benjamin Smith. He and Dr. Robin Cox put together a mobile multimedia experience, called the Big Tent. It can be thought of as a pop up venue for interactive / immersive concerts or installations with 8 projector screen walls and 8 speakers in a circular array. We do a lot in hardware and software to optimize mobility, minimize setup time, automate and create easier methods for artists to express themselves within the environment. It’s been a tremendous opportunity to assist in this project and see/be a part of their teamwork. From this experience I’ve gained a lot of knowledge in the software Max/MSP. This has allowed me to also begin prototyping a long list of my own instruments and experiments that I’ve dreamed of creating for years. "

I’ve easily made great friends in Indianapolis by being surrounded by like-minded people, and the affordability of the city allows me to have an active social life while living on a graduate student stipend.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I chose graduate school at IUPUI because I completed my undergraduate degree here and enjoyed my experience with faculty, staff, and other students in the Earth Sciences. I also was already aware of some of the research that occurs in the Department of Earth Sciences and felt confident I could find a lab that would fit my interests.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  My favorite academic accomplishment since starting my graduate degree is attending field work outings to collect samples for research within my lab group. On my first field work outing, we collected samples for my personal thesis project, but I have since attended several other field work trips. What I enjoy most about field work is spending time outdoors, gaining hands-on experience, and problem solving with my peers.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  What I enjoy most about Indianapolis is my social life! I’ve easily made great friends in Indianapolis by being surrounded by like-minded people, and the affordability of the city allows me to have an active social life while living on a graduate student stipend. I love finding new restaurants and finding free events to attend around the city.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  For my thesis research project, I work with Dr. Broxton Bird to address questions regarding the influence of climate variability on flooding patterns of the White River from a paleo-perspective. More specifically, I am using lake sediment archives from an oxbow lake on the White River and a multi-proxy approach to investigate the way that atmospheric circulation patterns, watershed-scale, and anthropogenic changes to the landscape impact flood dynamics. Reconstructing the flooding history of the White River provides insight to how flooding responds to hydroclimate variability and provides a new perspective to fluvial dynamics and modern climate change.  I am also a teaching assistant for my department. I have enjoyed this experience because it has given me the opportunity to work with undergraduate students and revisit subjects within geology that may not always apply to my field of research "

Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  When applying to MSc programs in 2013 I chose IUPUI for several reasons. The Biology Department at IUPUI provides all students in the MSc thesis program with full financial support. Moreover, I was highly interested in Neuroscience and IUPUI has many faculty doing excellent neuroscience research. Here I found my exact area of interest in Dr. Baucum’s lab studying synaptic connectivity and dysfunctionalities, specifically in neurodegenerative disease. After graduating with my MSc, I decided Dr. Baucum’s lab was a very inviting place to do research. His eagerness to new ideas, his excellent support of his students and his ambition all convinced me to stick around for my PhD.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  There have been many great opportunities at IUPUI to help me excel at being the best scientist possible. This includes travel awards to national meetings where I presented my work to others scientists, some of whom are leaders in the field of neuroscience. Other opportunities, such as teaching different lab courses or my involvement as vice president of the Biology Graduate Organization have been invaluable to my growth as a scientist. All of these opportunities can be distilled down into my favorite accomplishment of being honored with the outstanding master’s thesis award at IUPUI.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  I love being around nature, especially animals and birds. I always energized from surrounding myself with different types of plants and animals. This is what I like about Indy. It has all this beautiful nature embedded in city. Beside the beautiful nature of Indy, I enjoy the people here at IUPUI; my advisor, our lab manager, my great lab mates and all the awesome friends that I have here, all are part of the beauty of my life here in Indianapolis. I cannot explain how much love, care and support I have received from them.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  My research focuses on the interactions between various synaptic proteins in neuronal cells. Healthy brain function is a result of proper connectivity of neurons which is primarily dictated by proper organization of synaptic proteins. Any change in the interactions between synaptic proteins can lead to an alteration in normal brain function. My research tries to uncover the molecular and cellular basics of some of the protein-protein interactions that underlie important pathways in learning and memory. These findings allow for a better understanding of the molecular basis of number of brain functions and can also pave the way to understand a number of brain dysfunctionalities.

The Three Minute Thesis (3MT) is a research communication completion developed by The University of Queensland (UQ), Australia. 3MT develops graduate students’ capacity to effectively explain their research in 3 minutes to a non-specialist audience. A great presentation will tell the audience what the research is, how the doctoral researcher is doing it, what they have discovered, and why the research is significant. Graduate students seeking Master’s Degrees (i.e. M.S., M.A., M.P.H., M.P.A, etc.) or Graduate Certificates should register for the 3MP (Three Minute Pitch) competition.   ### Save the Date  3MT/3MP Competition 2023  Thursday, November 30, 2023  Thursday, November 30, 2023   ## Overview   ## History  The first 3MT competition was held at UQ in 2008 with 160 Research Higher Degree students competing. In 2009 and 2010 the 3MT competition was promoted to other Australian and New Zealand universities and enthusiasm for the concept grew. Due to its adoption in numerous universities, a multinational event was developed, and the Inaugural TransTasman 3MT competition was held at UQ in 2010.  Since 2011, the popularity of the competition has increased and 3MT competitions are now held in over 600 universities across more than 65 countries worldwide. In November 2013, the first Universitas 21 (U21) 3MT competition was held with several universities from around the world competing in a virtual competition. 2016 brought an expansion of the Trans-Tasman 3MT competition to include a South-East Asia and North-East Asia. This competition is now called the Asia-Pacific 3MT competition.  The PFFP program at IUPUI has been a 3MT partner organization since 2015 and has successfully held 3MT and 3MP competitions at the PFFP Annual Pathways Conference.   ## Eligibility  3MT - Active PhD and Professional Doctorate (Research) candidates who have successfully passed their confirmation milestone (including candidates whose thesis is under submission) by the date of their first presentation are eligible to participate in 3MT competitions at all levels, including the Asia-Pacific 3MT competition.

Somehow, Indianapolis offers many museums, restaurants, cultural events, and other opportunities while still feeling accessible. I loved exploring the city with family and friends, especially down along the canal.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I loved the balance of IUPUI that felt small enough to have a sense of community but large enough for many exciting opportunities. I heard about the wonderful professors at IUPUI from friends who previously attended the university. I also knew I wanted to work as a T.A. and the University Writing Center on campus offered me the chance to continue my love for Writing Center theory as a graduate consultant and T.A.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  Through the support of my professors and bosses at the UWC, my research into graduate writing support was accepted for two conferences—the East Central Writing Center Association Conference (ECWCA) in 2020 and the International Writing Center Association (IWCA) Collaborative at the Conference for College Composition and Communication (CCCC) which was moved to 2021 due to COVID-19. Presenting at the ECWCA conference alongside other IUPUI students was an amazing opportunity to demonstrate the incredible work able to be done at IUPUI as well as meet experts in my field. I am greatly looking forward to the IWCA Collaborative at the CCCC this year!  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  I think it is the same thing that drew me to IUPUI. I grew up in the country and never really enjoyed trips to Chicago and other cities that just felt overwhelming. Somehow, Indianapolis offers many museums, restaurants, cultural events, and other opportunities while still feeling accessible. I loved exploring the city with family and friends, especially down along the canal.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  Right now, I am completing IRB-approved research into graduate student writing support in order to develop UWC programming that will meet some of those needs, especially since COVID-19. I am able to work with the Graduate Office to develop and advertise these programs which is an amazing opportunity to build cross-campus relationships. Already our programming has grown from a short graduate writing group and a run of a write-on-site at the end of the Fall ’21 semester, to two offerings of the write-on-site every week and two writing groups that will run the entire semester. This work is also the foundation of my thesis, allowing me to dive into the theory of graduate student writing processes while seeing how it plays out in these groups.  Because of my passion for this research, I had the chance to become the Graduate Writing Coordinator at my work and love joining with some of the other graduate consultants at the UWC to grow and ground this programming so it can continue after I graduate. Working collaboratively to serve a community each of us is so attached to is incredible, and I love that IUPUI and the UWC gave me the chance to do this work. This past Fall semester, I worked as the T.A. for the Writing Center Theory and Practice course. Though jumping into a semester that was completely online was tricky, working with Dr. Marilee Brooks-Gillies was an amazing opportunity. I was able to see first-hand her expertise and compassion at work as she designed the course to meet the unique needs of the semester and the students. I aided her in research about how to effectively run an online course (especially one that previously had many in-person elements to it), navigated how to keep the students informed and connected to the UWC community, and assisted in creating assignments that would drive home the concepts of the course and provide a foundation for when the students became University Writing Center consultants.  I am currently serving as the Graduate Student Representative on the East Central Writing Center Association board and have loved being a part of an organization that cares so much about students, faculty, and staff and is constantly looking for how to better serve and support them. We are working hard to prepare for when conferences are allowed to be in-person again, and I am preparing to run one of the ECWCA book clubs on the book The Things We Carry: Strategies for Recognizing and Negotiating Emotional Labor in Writing Program Administration. I am excited to meet with Writing Center members from across the East Central area as we learn from each other. "

Roudebush Veterans Affairs Medical Center provides students with a wealth of research and clinical opportunities that I did not find at other schools.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  The Clinical Psychology program at IUPUI offered unparalleled opportunities to learn from and collaborate with renowned researchers who share similar interests. IUPUI’s proximity to several hospitals and medical centers such as the Richard L. Roudebush Veterans Affairs Medical Center provides students with a wealth of research and clinical opportunities that I did not find at other schools. In addition, the program’s training emphasis on severe mental illness and clinical science aligned with my interests and career goals. Also, the welcoming and supportive students and faculty, particularly my mentor, Dr. Michelle Salyers, made IUPUI the ideal place for me to pursue my Ph.D.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  My favorite academic accomplishment has been being able to explore and refine my own line of research through collaborating with faculty and students and engaging in academic writing and publishing. Within this domain, my favorite academic accomplishment was acting as lead author on a manuscript that was accepted for publication in Schizophrenia Research, a prominent journal in my field.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Since I came from a larger city prior to moving to Indianapolis, the lower cost of living and relative ease of driving around the city make Indianapolis a great place to live, especially on a graduate student budget. Further, the accessibility of Indianapolis makes it easy to enjoy all of the great restaurants, green spaces, museums, and events that Indianapolis provides.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  My research in graduate school has focused on the negative symptoms––reduced motivation, decreased social interest, blunted affect, and anhedonia––in people with schizophrenia, a severe mental illness that affects approximately 1% of the population. Negative symptoms tend to be associated with increased functional disability in people with schizophrenia, yet current treatments have little efficacy in improving these symptoms. One barrier to effective treatment is a limited understanding of the psychological factors that contribute to the development and maintenance of negative symptoms. Accordingly, the goal of my current research is to inform psychosocial interventions by investigating psychological and cognitive mechanisms that contribute to negative symptoms, especially motivation deficits, in people with schizophrenia.

I’m also working on a project with Dr. Sean Grant researching the use of evidence-based practices in the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant Program. Last summer, I had the pleasure of interning with the IUPUI ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) Center, which brings together interprofessional groups of health professionals to discuss lecture and case presentations. When I’m not doing that, I am usually with the folks from the MPH Student Association and Eta Sigma Gamma health education honor society, planning activities and service events. "

All the students, colleagues, and faculty here are so supportive, caring, and an absolute joy to work with.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I wanted to attend IU for my doctoral degree because the IU Anatomy & Physiology Education Track Ph.D. Program has an excellent reputation for training some of the best anatomy educators. At IU, I was able to get a world-class education and collaborate with incredible mentors and colleagues who supported me every step of the way!  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  My favorite academic accomplishment during my time at Indiana University is earning the Lieber Memorial Associate Instructor Award in 2023! The award represents several years of hard work dedicated towards improving my abilities as an anatomy educator. None of it would have been possible without the support of my Ph.D. Program here at IU!  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  I love the people here at IU School of Medicine! All the students, colleagues, and faculty here are so supportive, caring, and an absolute joy to work with.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  Most of my research focuses on anatomy education and how we think about our own thinking (aka metacognition). Metacognition is so important when learning challenging subjects like anatomy as well as in clinical professions because it allows us to independently monitor and self-regulate our own learning and performance. Once we are more aware of our own strengths and weaknesses as learners, we can take the appropriate steps to improve! My research interests also include educator development and science communication. Everyone has human anatomy so everyone should have an opportunity to learn human anatomy – to learn about themselves ! "

We want to help you navigate your IUPUI experience by offering insights, instruction and guidance. Check out our blog!  [Life of a Grad Jag blog](https://blogs.iu.edu/grademissaries/)   ### 10 Things I Wish I Had Known About Grad School  Read about what our Emissaries wish they had known before starting grad school.  The goal of the Graduate Emissaries for Student Diversity program is to connect trained IUPUI graduate and professional students to serve as program ambassadors and assist in the various stages of the graduate process. A major function of emissaries is to provide for the interchange/exchange of information that facilitate progression and successful completion of their graduate student programs. Emissaries will serve as initial peer contacts for pre-application graduate and professional students and will also work to build a more inclusive graduate student community through formal and informal mentoring activities. Additionally, emissaries will assist in creating a welcoming campus environment, networking support, and providing information and referrals to on campus resources and services particularly for underrepresented and minority students.  Graduate emissaries play a critical role of introducing graduate opportunities to diverse and talented prospective graduate students. Using effective peer-to peer communication channels, emissaries will work to positively support the university’s recruitment, outreach and advocacy efforts across diverse communities.  Emissary activities must comply with University Graduate School, and Indiana University policy, and regulations. Emissaries will receive a small stipend each semester that they serve and report directly to Dr. Tabitha Hardy, Assistant Dean.

Since I have lived here, I have traveled to Illinois, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Minnesota, Colorado, Montana, California, Hawaii, and the Bahamas.   #### Alumna  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I completed my BS in Geology at IUPUI. For many of the same reasons why I initially chose IUPUI, I felt inspired to further my education here. I had worked closely with many great professors and students on campus, and when it came time to choose a graduate program, I realized that IUPUI would be the best environment for me to continue to grow as a student and as a geologist.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  My favorite and most prominent academic accomplishment while acquiring my Masters was the opportunity to attend my profession’s largest annual conference (the Geological Society of America’s annual conference, this year held in Denver, Colorado). I was accepted to present a poster on my graduate research, accumulated over the last 14 months. During my presentation, a man came up to me, pointed at my poster, and said, “Hey, that’s my name!” And that was how I met my colleague Dr. Jaime Escobar from Colombia, South America, for the first time. I was also able to meet an idol, Dr. Bryon Steinman, by sheer circumstance; his first and only graduate student’s presentation was right next to mine!  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  We literally live at the crossroads of America! Since I have lived here, I have traveled to Illinois, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Minnesota, Colorado, Montana, California, Hawaii, and the Bahamas. Almost every imaginable place is reachable in just a few hours by plane, which has provided an amazing opportunity to see the world around me.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  I am currently developing a ~2500 year long paleo-hydroclimate record in for a lake in Boyacá, Colombia, South America. This is done by using physical and geochemical analyses of lake sediments to reconstruct the local paleoclimate. By comparing my data with other South American records, I hope to provide evidence for the “dry-island effect,” which was first mentioned in 1975 by J.W. Snow, but as of yet, remains unproven.  I am also the School of Science Graduate Student Council’s (SOSGSC) Representative for the Earth Sciences Dept., and teach lab sections for the Introduction to Geology and Environmental Science (Geol-G 20 and G117, respectively).  Kathryn is also a recipient of the IUPUI Travel Fellowship award. Read more about her Travel Fellowship here » "

Bonfils   ### Ph.D in Clinical Psychology  I was excited to engage in clinical work with complex cases, embedded in community agencies where I could learn how to work on multidisciplinary teams. IUPUI is really a cut above most graduate programs both in their research emphasis and their clinical training opportunities.   #### Alumna  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  There are a number of reasons I chose to attend graduate school at IUPUI. First, as a local, I already knew what a great school IUPUI is, and I was familiar with the positivity and collaborative atmosphere in the Psychology Department. I had also already had the opportunity to work with Dr. Michelle Salyers during my time as an undergraduate, so I knew that I would thrive under her mentorship at the graduate level. Dr. Salyers’ research also aligns well with my own interests, and having a Severe Mental Illness track in the Clinical Psychology program means there is an excellent network of other researchers and students with compatible interests, as well. Lastly, our Clinical Psychology program is unique in that we have a wide variety of clinical training opportunities available in the community. I was excited to engage in clinical work with complex cases, embedded in community agencies where I could learn how to work on multidisciplinary teams. IUPUI is really a cut above most graduate programs both in their research emphasis and their clinical training opportunities.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  My favorite accomplishment since starting graduate school is also the most recent – obtaining a prestigious internship position at the Semel Institute at UCLA for the upcoming year. In all clinical psychology programs, students must complete a year of clinical internship prior to receiving their degree. The application and interviewing process is arduous, but I found it to be very exciting and rewarding. I traveled the country to interview at a number of sought-after internship sites and was able to talk with some of the biggest researchers in my area of study. While this was intellectually stimulating and validating to me as a researcher, I was also able to use these discussions to bring more recognition to the great things we have going on at IUPUI. Obtaining such an excellent internship placement feels like the culmination of all of my training, and I am excited to begin a new chapter in my training with this internship.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Having grown up in Indianapolis and attended undergrad at IUPUI, I obviously liked it enough to stick around! There are so many things to enjoy about the city and the surrounding suburbs. For me, I really like the close proximity of several state or national parks. I also appreciate the reduced traffic and low cost of living! For me, a big bonus of attending graduate school in Indianapolis is having my family be local. It has been great to have their support as I moved through such a busy time in my life.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  My research and clinical work focus on the social cognitive deficits seen in people diagnosed with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders and psychosocial treatments we can implement to best help this group. For my preliminary project, I conducted a meta-analysis examining deficits in empathy for people with schizophrenia. I found that people with schizophrenia report reduced experience of affective empathy, or the experience of empathic emotion when seeing another in a difficult situation (e.g., feeling sad when your friend is sad because she lost a close relative), but that their experience of personal distress, or the experience of maladaptive negative emotions when seeing others in a difficult situation, is heightened. This work has since produced two first-authored publications in well-respected journals in my field. Subsequently, I designed my dissertation project to examine whether the experience of personal distress negatively impacts empathic performance. I hope this project and my future work will enhance the field’s understanding of what contributes to deficits in social cognition in this group as well as how we might best intervene to alleviate those deficits.

I specifically chose IUPUI’s Addiction Neuroscience program (formerly known as Psychobiology of Addictions) because it is one of the only programs in the country that offers a strong foundation for research on drug addiction and its consequences. When I interviewed at IUPUI, I felt that the faculty and graduate students in this program were not competing with one another but rather working together and collaborating on projects, making it a very enjoyable working environment. Also, the mentorship provided by the faculty is desirable because not only do they try to mentor you on becoming a skillful and talented scientist, but they push you to strengthen further skills such as teaching, time management, grant writing, mentoring, and promoting individuality. Lastly, IUPUI is keen on forming new collaborations between and within departments and other schools (including the School of Medicine), allowing for opportunity for growth and diversifying research. I am very fortunate that I got accepted to IUPUI and could have not asked for a better experience or opportunity.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  When I started graduate school, my foundational understanding of neuroscience was very weak and I had a difficult time with the dense and advanced information provided in each class, lab meeting, and conversation. I feel that I have grown substantially not only as a graduate student but as a future neuroscientist and electrophysiologist. I am thankful for the training that I have received from my mentor, Dr. Christopher Lapish, and I wouldn’t be where I am today without his leadership. My other favorite accomplishment has been receiving multiple travel awards and publishing as a first author in recognized journals including Psychopharmacology and Behavioural Pharmacology.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Coming from the west coast, moving to Indianapolis was quite an adjustment but the city has really grown on me. I enjoy the food and the microbreweries. I enjoy the night life and the hiking trails. I enjoy the farmer’s markets and the closeness of the community. My husband and I are able to do so many things and we are exceedingly thankful for that.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  My primary interests are cognitive function and brain physiology in rodent models of disease, including addiction and schizophrenia. My long-term goals are to understand the neural mechanisms associated with aberrant behavior and cognition, as well as to identify translational biomarkers to better understand the etiology of schizophrenia to identify possible novel treatment approaches. To achieve these goals, I have used rodent models of addiction and schizophrenia to explore altered cognitive function while simultaneously evaluating electrophysiological metrics in multiple brain regions. I have also formed collaborations with colleagues on various projects that explore neural mechanisms and networks that are involved in impulsivity and processing stimuli in a genetic rodent model of excessive drinking (P-rat).  Although research has played a primary role in my training and career, I have had the rewarding opportunity to mentor ten undergraduate students, supervising them on their honors theses. In addition to balancing research and mentorship, I have been involved in teaching several courses including Behavioral Neuroscience and Statistics. During my time in graduate school, I have also been a part of several graduate student organization committees (e.g. president and representative of the School of Science Graduate Student Council, member of academic misconduct committee, School of Science Alumni Board member), and have volunteered in various activities (e.g. science fair judge, graduate student panelist, brain activity table at Winter Conference on Brain Research).

Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  [Regenstrief Institute](https://www.regenstrief.org/)  [Sandra Eskenazi Center for Brain Care and Innovation](http://www.eskenazihealth.edu/health-services/brain-center)  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  Every achievement that I have made at IUPUI has been a rewarding experience both in terms of knowledge as well as in terms of personal growth and hence, it is difficult to pick favorites. However, my most recent research involving ICU clinicians optimally managing interruptions from their mobile devices is something that I feel have significant real-world applications and is close to my heart. This research suggests a set of novel design guidelines that can be adopted while creating ICU mobile applications. These design guidelines will be published at the Human Factors in Computing ’16 conference, one of the most leading conferences in HCI. I am proud of this little accomplishment although this research is a small, design-based contribution to the medical and HCI communities.  [Human Factors in Computing ’16](https://chi2016.acm.org/wp/)  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  I really love walking/biking on the canal or the cultural trail on a day with pleasant weather. I also love the people here – I have always noticed people who hold the door for others, or smile or wish others on streets.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  My doctoral research addresses an emerging critically needed area within the field of healthcare related to human-centered computing, with a focus on the use of health information technology to support safe, effective, and efficient patient care in the intensive care unit (ICU). After a medical emergency that forced me into becoming a part-time student and as I progressed into the program while making my way back to full-time status, I started developing an interest for health and mental wellness research. This interest came to me in the wake of having been a patient in the ICU myself. I was fascinated by the concept of using technology interventions to support everyone in the care-giving process, from the physician to a nurse to a patient who might be suffering from a brain-related disorder.  My recent research efforts focus on the problem of task and goals management of ICU teams. The result has been a novel application that addresses the cognitive/behavioral outcomes of interruptions generated by a notification system built into a task management application. I feel that one of the significant contributions of my doctoral research would be a set of design guidelines that can help in managing notification interruptions from mobile health technology in the ICU. This can significantly reduce or avoid unwanted interruptions or alert fatigue induced by smartphone text messages or phone calls in the ICU through improved communication systems that use patient-centric information.  Parallel to my dissertation research, I have also collaborated in conducting experiments to study the extreme mediation of smartphones and social media on human health and well-being. I have also contributed to the better part of several conference papers as a co-author.  Outside of research, I serve as a member of the Women in Technology group and the chair of ACM-W student chapter at SOIC. I am also the local leader for the Interaction Design Foundation (IDF), Indianapolis Chapter, a non-profit group that brings together students and professionals to promote conversations about interaction design and user experience with an eye towards individual members’ careers and interests. I actively organize, host, and facilitate meetings where I presents my ideas and encourage the research interests of attendees. I have solely been involved in fund-seeking with external organizations such as Yahoo and GravityDrive to fund the chapter meetings. Some of the past events include a design challenge and a scavenger hunt, which enabled students from different disciplines and professionals in the Indianapolis area to participate and compete.  Outside of school, I am very interested in physical fitness and am currently training to run a marathon soon. "

I chose to study at IUPUI’s Herron School of Art & Design for two reasons. Having run a small arts organization for several years connecting art to social issues in India, the degree matched the skills I was looking to improve: learning the theory behind our practical activities, maturing my own studio practice, and finding opportunities to grow in my ability to teach. But I also chose Herron specifically because I did my undergraduate degree in Indiana and wanted to deepen my ties to Indianapolis and to a local arts organization here called the Harrison Center for the Arts.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  This is my first year and so far I have found both my classmates and my classes incredibly stimulating.  This semester I won a local $10,000 art competition in ‘creative place-making,’ which sees art play a role in community-building in a neighborhood going through a revitalization effort. One of my classes happens to be ‘Public Art & Project Management’ and as I implement the art competition project the Public Art class is giving me these amazing insights into the challenges I am finding.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  I love how Indy is a city with a vision, working on very intentional plans to be a place people would want to move to. It has this feeling of a large cutting-edge city while still maintaining the intimacy and sense of belonging that comes from being small and located in the Mid-west. I love the Indiana ‘farming-community’ culture that still is a part of urban life, with the neighbor across the street regularly giving my wife and I tomatoes and cucumbers from her backyard. And as an artist I love how the city offers a vibrant cultural life and yet is small enough that there are many opportunities to participate and contribute, even as a student.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  In my studio courses I have been working on developing the technical aspects of my painting practice while learning to articulate a theoretical framework and situate it in the context of contemporary art history. Last semester I took a fascinating class on ‘Visual Culture’ plus one on Collaboration which had 8 of us develop an exhibition over the course of the semester. Ours was the ‘Dreams Diner,’ which turned your ‘dream items’ picked from a menu, into a personalized miniature sculpture which you could walk away with. We presented it in one of the Herron galleries and will be exhibiting it elsewhere in town as well. Currently I am taking classes on university teaching and public art.  The fellowships I have been awarded have had me working with the Harrison Center for the Arts each semester, and among other things I have curated a show of 22 Indian artists in one of the Harrison Center galleries, constructed a 15’ x 14’ x 5’ set of giant eye-glasses as an interactive sculpture which currently sit on the lawns outside the Harrison Center, and organized a ‘Holiday Window Display Tour’ that mobilized 24 Harrison Center artists to turn their basement studio windows into miniature store-front displays for the city-wide December ‘First Friday’ gallery walk.  Currently I am working with an artist collaborator on implementing our creative place-making project. The project essentially is a massive art performance designed to unite and inspire a racially and economically divided community by making history together: we’re going to try to break the world record for most sparklers lit simultaneously!

Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  In all honesty, I came to IUPUI to finish my undergraduate degree because it was convenient: close to where I lived and worked, and affordable. Not the most inspiring reason, right? Well, that was in 2016, and at the time my only goal was to finish my BA so I could teach English overseas. A means to an end: get the degree and get out. Now (writing this in 2022) I am a deeply engaged PhD student and I absolutely love my discipline (communication studies) and the work I do. I stayed because I found a community of people– a community of scholars– who are truly working to make the world better.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  Earlier this year I was surprised with the “Outstanding Service Award” (for a graduate student) from my department. Although the award/recognition is nice, the real reward is what it signifies: that the work done behind the scenes to foster a community among my peers here at IUPUI matters to and for other people. In other words, the recognition is feedback – a useful way to know that at least some of the things I do are useful to those around me so that I continue to serve even more effectively. Any individual academic achievement is only meaningful to me in relation to how it sits in the larger context of scholarship and community; I’m a pragmatist in this concern.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  I have lived in Indy since about 2009, and I only moved here from a short distance away, from Selma (a small town outside of Muncie, just north of the Indianapolis area). As mentioned above, I had thought about leaving– but ultimately, I stayed here to engage the university community beyond undergrad. In addition to Indy (and Indiana) being “home”, I am honored to call IUPUI my academic home.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  I have myriad interests as a researcher and student: mental health, health equity, community engagement, higher education reform, advancing the social sciences through embracing the quantum paradigm, and other applied communication research. I am a research assistant in the department of Communication Studies, which grants me the opportunity to work and learn with different faculty each semester, expanding my experience and skillset. As an associate researcher of the Global Health Communication Center, I am engaged in community-based research aimed at improving overall well-being at both the local and global levels. I have recently published my first peer-reviewed article focused on mental health and college campus service availability. "

One of the most rewarding opportunities I have had during my time at IUSD is my four-year involvement with the Indiana University Student Outreach Clinic (IUSOC). This student run multidisciplinary organization focuses its efforts on Indianapolis’ Near Eastside underserved community.   #### Alumna  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  My husband and I are from Northeast Ohio, and I applied to dental schools throughout the Midwest. I initially had my heart set on attending one of the two dental schools in Ohio, but once I visited the IU School of Dentistry (IUSD) I knew this was where I wanted to pursue my degree. The administration was extremely helpful, the preclinical facilities were impressive, and there were endless extracurricular opportunities. I couldn’t be happier with my decision!  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  My favorite academic accomplishment during my time at IUSD is successfully passing all components of the national and regional board licensing examinations. These series of examinations are one of the most stressful aspects of dental school, but I feel IUSD prepared me well both from clinical and academic standpoints.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Indianapolis has been a great city to call home for the past four years. Coming from a small town, I appreciate the small town feel Indianapolis has. Indy also has a wide range of activities and events, so there is something for everyone, regardless of what interests you have!  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  Through the hard work of volunteers from the schools of dentistry, medicine, law, social work, nursing, physical therapy and others, patients are able to receive free comprehensive services. Serving in leadership roles, and this past year as Chair of the dental clinic, I have had the privilege of working in an interprofessional environment, collaborating with students from varying disciplines, while continuing to improve the oral and overall care for the Near Eastside. In addition to the SOC and other local service commitments, my passion for public health dentistry has driven my involvement with IUSD international service teams to Kenya, Haiti, Guatemala, and Ecuador.  IUSD also has many research opportunities, and I have been a recipient of the Student Research Fellowship for the past three years. I am currently working on my fifth research project and my focus is potential scaffolding for regenerative endodontic procedures. "

Indianapolis is a beautiful city, with countless opportunities for individuals and healthcare professionals to grow and develop.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I attended IUPUI for my BSN as an undergraduate. I enjoyed the school, and the offerings for research and clinical experiences with five local hospitals. I appreciated being at a university that was recognized nationally. IU School of Nursing is recognized nationally for multiple nursing programs by U.S. News and World Report. If you want to be a future leader, it is key to learn and be trained by one of the best nursing programs in the country.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  My favorite academic accomplishment so far has been being selected for the Emergency Medical Services for Children (EMSC) Scholars Program in Spring 2021. EMSC is a nationally and federally funded program to reduce child and youth disability and death due to severe illness and injury. Its mission is to minimize morbidity and mortality of acutely ill and injured children across the EMS for children continuum. The EMSC Scholars program was launched in 2021, designed to support early career clinicians and health system professionals to become future leaders in becoming leaders in the pediatric emergency space. My work with the EMSC Scholars program research and doctoral project coincide to focus on pediatric emergency care coordinators in Indiana and potential enablers and barriers to appointment and retention. I have the privilege to work with local and national mentors to refine and complete my research, with the hopes to publish and present at the state and national level.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Indianapolis has always held a special place for me in my heart. The IUPUI campus was the location I met my husband, got engaged to be married, obtained my undergraduate degree, and where I am continuing my current professional and academic endeavors. In addition, Indianapolis is the home of Riley Hospital for Children, which is the place that helped me recognize my love and passion for pediatrics and emergency medicine. Indianapolis is a beautiful city, with countless opportunities for individuals and healthcare professionals to grow and develop.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  As an EMSC Scholars recipient, I am currently working on my research study devoted to identifying factors affecting pediatric emergency care coordinator (PECC) appointment by state and national experts. From the findings of this study, additional research will be focused on specific factors here in Indiana that affect PECC appointment and pediatric readiness across the state. PECCs are a key role in improving pediatric readiness, being identified as the greatest intervention to improve pediatric emergency care outcomes and decrease pediatric morbidity and mortality. In addition to my research work as a graduate student, I have volunteered with the Diabetes Youth Foundation of Indiana (DYFI) located in Noblesville, IN. I have spent the last 6 years serving at DYFI camp over the summer serving as medical staff. In 2021, I became a board member for the organization, and continue now serving in a lead medical staff role within the group. DYFI is a local 501c3 non-profit with a mission and passion to educate, encourage, and empower children living with Type 1 diabetes, while providing support to their families. With DYFI I work to help support efforts to serve hundreds of youth every year with residential summer camps, day camp, family & teen weekends, ambassador programs, and other outreach opportunities. All of my desire and passion in my personal, professional, and educational background all focus on improving care for children. I am the proud mother of two children, age 3 & 8. I am driven to ensure quality care and resources for my children and all other children across the state. "

Through a combination of classes, internships, and graduate assistantships, I have been able to build the skills, knowledge, and professional network I need to put myself on a new career trajectory.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I chose graduate school at IUPUI for a few reasons: it is located where I already live so it’s convenient; I had been working on campus for many years before joining the American Studies PhD program so IUPUI already felt like home to me; and, most importantly, the program I joined is exactly what I was looking for in a PhD program. Prior to my return to school, I was working full-time on campus in student admissions and advising, but I wanted to make a professional pivot and do something with my career that was more socially and civically engaged. The American Studies PhD program has been a great fit for me because of its flexible curriculum. Through a combination of classes, internships, and graduate assistantships, I have been able to build the skills, knowledge, and professional network I need to put myself on a new career trajectory.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  It’s hard for me to choose just one academic accomplishment to call my favorite. I have a husband and three little kids, which adds a layer of complexity to the PhD for me, and so successfully navigating the logistical challenges of managing family and academic commitments each week, semester, and year feels like something to celebrate. I feel very grateful for the opportunity to be in the program and have loved nearly every aspect of it. In particular, I have really enjoyed my classes, building relationships with my peers in my program, building a network of new colleagues, getting to know residents in the community where I am doing fieldwork, and contributing to important conversations about equity and inclusion. Pursuing a PhD is a big undertaking in and of itself, and it has been very rewarding.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Someone I interviewed in my fieldwork described Indianapolis as a “Goldilocks City,” saying it is generally neither too big nor too small, and I agree with that. It seems like just the right size of a city where finding a good balance between personal goals and professional pursuits feels possible. While not being so big that the city feels overwhelming, overpriced, and overcrowded for me, Indianapolis is also not so small where it feels like there are not enough things to do and not enough professional opportunities. Personally, I love the downtown area where it feels like there is always something going on. Professionally, I appreciate that public, civic, nonprofit, and business leaders are relatively accessible, which has deepened and enriched my qualitative research.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  My dissertation research is a qualitative study of economic development in Indianapolis. Typically, economic development’s impacts are measured in quantitative terms, using datapoints like number of new businesses created, number of jobs created, and increases in incomes, but such systems of measures do not capture people’s opinions and lived experiences. As a result, I am doing a qualitative study where I am interviewing city- and neighborhood-level practitioners in and around the realm of economic development as well as near northwest side residents to understand people’s perceptions of economic development. I am looking for areas of alignment and misalignment in how people think about and discuss economic development and the benefits they want it to bring to the city and its neighborhoods. This research may be able to enlighten conversations about the ways in which structures and practices of economic development can be more equitable and inclusive. "

I also work as a Leadership Consultant for the non-profit Children’s Defense Fund Indianapolis Freedom School Partnership. As a graduate assistant, I work in conjunction with the Program Director, Danielle McMillian, to recruit, retain, and prepare students who are committed to social justice. We do this by encouraging students to attain academic success, engage in leadership and civic activities, and prepare for a meaningful post-baccalaureate experience. The primary goal is to provide students with opportunities for leadership development and promote diversity and cross-cultural engagement. As a leadership consultant I am responsible for the formulation and implementation of the strategic efforts and direct operation for six full-time staff, forty families, fifty K-12 students, and numerous community partners. In this role I am dedicated to delivering equity by serving and developing underserved communities.  My research is centered on the black male experience in education. My early interest focused mostly on black males attending predominately white collegiate institutions. My work with the Children’s Defense Fund and programs like Upward Bound at IUPUI, has shifted my lens to a more holistic approach, that being K-12 through college. This is a population that has been marginalized, under supported and underrepresented in the education system. My work and research is to combat the narrative and reality of the “school-to-prison-pipeline,” with one that is more fitting like “preschool-to-Ph.D.” Being a part of different committees and organizations such as Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc., help me to achieve these aspirations.

In the summer of 2015, my advisor and I flew to eastern Tibet and spent a month collecting samples for my dissertation. It was an amazing opportunity to experience a new culture and learn more about the region.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  I enjoy the laid back city lifestyle. Indy has a diverse offering of neighborhoods, cultural experiences, restaurants, shopping, and recreation opportunities. The low cost of living means that as a student, I am able to enjoy more of the city culture on a student stipend.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  My dissertation is on tracking how the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) has changed throughout the past 10,000 years. The ISM is the dominant source of precipitation to southeastern Asia, a region that has a growing human population and subsequent water demands, with many communities still dependent on subsistence agriculture. Variability of the ISM has been increasing in recent decades in connection to changing climate, but scientists need better understanding of how this system varies naturally to detect future changes and make better predictions. I use lake sediments from eastern Tibet to study how the monsoon changes over time; focusing on several proxies, including sediment characteristics and algal fragments, that infer changes in precipitation and lake levels. My goal is to produce several long-term records of multiple indicators of monsoon intensity that can be used by other scientists to improve their models that predict how this system will change in the future.

In 2016, when Dr. Basu became Department Chair of the Chemistry and Chemical Biology Department here at IUPUI, I was given the opportunity to return to Indiana and I am so grateful for that opportunity. I loved my previous time at IUB and my tenure at IUPUI has been just as rewarding. The Chemistry and Chemical Biology department has been extremely helpful and supportive during the moving process and as I complete my degree. It has been clear from day one that all of the professors want the students to succeed and they cultivate a supportive atmosphere for graduate students to learn and grow as scientists.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  Since continuing my degree here at IUPUI I have been able to attend the 10th annual Molybdenum and Tungsten Enzyme Conference in Santa Fe, New Mexico. This conference occurs every two years and researchers in my field travel from all over the world to attend the meeting. This year I was invited to present my work including both a poster and an oral presentation. The feedback I received has been invaluable as I move towards the end of my studies.  I have also had to opportunity recently to travel to Ventura, California to attend the Bioinorganic Research Seminar, which is a part of the Metals in Biology Gordon Conference. I was given the opportunity to present a poster and discuss my research and future career options with the leaders of my field.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Having lived most of my life right outside of Pittsburgh, PA, I love city life. Indianapolis is a great city, there is so much to do and the people here are wonderful.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  My laboratory studies molybdopterin enzymes. My project specifically focuses on the synthesis of small molecule mimics of molybdenum cofactor, which is the active site of molybdopterin enzymes. This cofactor is made up of multiple redox active components and questions still remain on how these components work together during catalysis. We are utilizing small molecule mimics that have been designed based upon the structure of the molybdenum cofactor, and study the reactivity, redox properties and electronics of the mimics. This information gives potential insight into how the cofactor tunes its reactivity towards a specific substrate and how the individual redox active components of the cofactor may work together during catalysis.

    "body": "  ### Graduate CAS and WebAdMIT Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) for Graduate/Professional  Programs  This FAQ was designed to help graduate admissions staff and faculty better understand the new application, IU Graduate CAS, and how to process applications in the administrative backend, WebAdMIT. All staff should start their training by completing the required trainings based on work groups , reviewing the WebAdMIT Glossary and the Liaison - Indiana University Terms Guide .  [WebAdMIT Glossary](https://help.liaisonedu.com/WebAdMIT_Help_Center/Getting_Started/WebAdMIT_Quick_Start_Guides/03_Glossary)  [Liaison - Indiana University Terms Guide](https://graduate.iupui.edu/doc/faculty-staff/UniCAS/UniCAS-terms.pdf)   ## General Questions  What is WebAdMIT?  WebAdMIT is a cloud-based admissions management platform vended by Liaison International that provides staff and faculty with tools to streamline their admissions processes. WebAdMIT replaced your action list in Kuali workflow and can replace your in-house graduate enrollment management platforms used to facilitate admissions committee processes (e.g. IUIE, Box, spreadsheets, printed application files, Sharepoint sites).  Note - you will no longer receive emails alerting you that you have applications to review. You must log into WebAdMIT via one.iu.edu to review newly submitted applications, and process existing applications when you have open applications.  What is IU Graduate CAS?  IU Graduate CAS is Indiana University’s centralized application service. Applicants to any IU graduate or professional program, or Purdue program at IUPUI, will apply through the IU Graduate CAS. This includes graduate certificates, graduate non-degree programs, and post-baccalaureate programs coded at the graduate level on all IU campuses. IUPUI is becoming IU Indianapolis in the fall of 2024. For 54 years we have redefined what it means to be a premier urban research university. Now we are building on that foundation to train the next generation of innovative leaders.  Schools and departments have the option of utilizing a “deep link”, a campus specific URL that will direct individuals to the IU Graduate CAS with applications for that campus pre-filtered. Instructions on how to obtain your campus / CAS Cycle specific deep link can be found in MS OneDrive . CAS login required.  [MS OneDrive](https://indiana.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/msteams_3840e9/ETfUNz5pCQdMsiKmiAfT2BMBfqrsfOJfxJeJQcXb-Gy2KQ?e=tcay7P)  What is a CAS Cycle and how does it work?  Liaison operates on CAS Cycles that have an open and close date, and include applications for specific academic terms. IU Graduate CAS will have overlapping CAS cycles to accommodate departments that begin accepting applications earlier than most other programs. CAS Cycles also allow the IU Core Team to build the next application without interruption to the current CAS, and to implement newly released functionality to improve the applicant experience.  For each CAS cycle, there is a separate URL for the IU Graduate CAS applicant portal. Graduate programs who have overlapping application cycles in separate CAS cycles will need to manage two URLs on their website, and in communication templates (i.e. application deadline for Fall 2022 overlaps with open date for Spring 2023). Alternatively, departments can link directly to their campus’ central Graduate Office How-to-Apply webpage to ensure the accurate link is provided to applicants based on their anticipated entry term.  Admissions representatives can process applicants in each CAS Cycle utilizing the “cycle switcher”, or drop down, in the upper right corner of WebAdMIT.  Current Active CAS Cycles:  How do I access archived information about the transition to Liaison UniCAS?  This information is currently available on MS OneDrive. You must be logged in to an IU server utilizing your IU login, then you should be able to access all documents found within this folder . This is where you will find past listserv announcements and other important documents.

The Quadrant 4 (Q4) of the IU Graduate CAS is the program specific section that representatives can brand and design for each plan / sub-plan and admit term. Once your Q4 is completed, submitted for review, and approved your applicants will be able to select it from the “Add Program” page on and AFTER the “Open Date” you list in the configuration portal. Applicants see this as the “Program Materials” section of the application.  Within the WebAdMIT Configuration Portal program representatives will be able to activate any, all, or none of the following tabs: Question Tab, Document Tab, Recommendation Tab. You will work with your admissions team to determine which tabs you want available to your applicants based on your application process and admissions committee requirements. At minimum, you must configure the Home / Branding page for every plan / sub-plan / term your department offers.  What steps should we take to prepare to build our program’s Quadrant 4 (Q4)?  How to Plan - Quadrant 4 Build is a brief summary of what you will need to do to build your program's Q4(s). Prior to each CAS Cycle programs have the opportunity to edit existing applications, or build new applications in the WebAdMIT pre-launch portal.  Will departments be able to modify questions in Quadrants 1, 2, and 3 to their programs requirements?  These are general and are applicable to all programs and all campuses. Q4 is the only quadrant a department or program can customize. A department can add instructions, questions, require document uploads, and letters of recommendation requirements in the Configuration Portal.  What is the timeline for building/updating the Q4?  While a CAS cycle is “live,” only minimal changes can be made to the Q4. Once a program's Q4 has been approved and activated only the home page/branding section, and deadline can be updated by those in the Director of Admissions Work Group.  If you need to have an application created for a new graduate program please complete the Approval of New Programs form . You will then be contacted by your campus representative to move forward with editing the Q4 and submitting it for review.  [Approval of New Programs form](https://survey.graduate.iu.edu/machform/view.php?id=55938)  During prelaunch, you will have the opportunity to review and revise your existing Q4s for the upcoming CAS cycle. Prelaunch will typically open in November and will available for revision until January.  Can schools or departments use their own branding in Q4?  Yes, but it must meet IU Branding guidelines. See Quadrant 4 (Q4) Program Materials Branding Your Home Page .  Is it possible to prevent an applicant who does not meet eligibility requirements from applying to specific programs?  Yes, by using the Program Availability Rule, you can choose to hide or show specific programs to an applicant based on their responses to the Extended Profile or program-level questions. For more details visit the Program Availability Rule .  Is it possible to list both international and domestic deadlines in Q4?  Yes, if you have a separate deadline for international applications you will be able to include it in the Q4. For more details visit Multiple Deadlines per Program for more information.  Are application fee waivers available for applicants?  Active U.S. military, veterans, and members of the Reserves or National Guard will receive a university-level fee waiver. Departments can add additional fee waiver questions in the Q4 for programs such as AmeriCorps. IU Graduate CAS Fee Waiver Training document is available.  What Work Groups have access to configure the Q4?  The Director of Admissions, Department Configuration Portal Team and the Department API Team can configure the Q4.  To request access complete and submit the User Access Request .  [User Access Request](https://survey.graduate.iu.edu/machform/view.php?id=58203)  Is it possible to assign two individuals to work on the department's Quadrant 4 (Q4)?  Yes, more than one individual can be responsible for the Q4 configuration as long as they have the correct work group access and departmental access.  If a department does not require GRE scores for admission, will there be any way to exclude this requirement from our application?  All standardized test component fields in the IU Graduate CAS are optional. You have the opportunity to tell applicants your requirements on your home/branding page when configuring the program’s Quadrant 4 (Q4).  Can Q4 configurations be changed once the application is live?  Once a program's Q4 has been approved and activated only the home page/branding section and deadline can be updated by those in the Director of Admissions Work Group.  Can a recommendation submitted for an applicant be utilized for multiple applications?  It depends! Graduate and professional programs have 11 recommendation form options that programs can utilize when configuring their Program Materials section (aka Q4).  If an applicant applies to another program that utilized the same recommendation form, within the same application cycle, and submits the same recommender the system can automatically complete the recommendation and submits it on behalf of the recommender.  [recommendation form options](https://graduate.iupui.edu/doc/faculty-staff/UniCAS/UniCAS-recommendation-forms.pdf)  The recommender must enable this feature when they complete their first recommendation request. For more information visit Liaison Help Center - Completing a Recommendation.

Workflow in WebAdMIT is built around Local Statuses that are tied to Decision Codes for each applicant. Programs update an applicant’s Local Status utilizing the List function in WebAdMIT. Applications do not route in WebAdMIT, there is no automatic movement. Your Action List will now be referred to as the Applicant List.  You will have four required lists to view daily: Received, Complete, Returned to Department, Program/Term Change. Depending on how you configured your program you may, or may not, have applications in your Received Action List. These Applicant lists have been created for you and are listed on the left side of the dashboard view under the “Applicant Lists”.  In order to successfully process applications in WebAdMIT and ensure that application decisions are recorded in SIS PeopleSoft you MUST view the Workflow Basics Webinar recording .  [Workflow Basics Webinar recording](https://iu.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/8.22.19+WebAdMIT+Workflow+-+The+Basics+Training+%28IUPUI+Campus+Trainers%29/1_4fusslfn)  For more details see the Workflow design chart as well as the Workflow training guide .  Our school utilizes faculty on our admissions committee to rank applicants and to interview them? Can faculty have access to WebAdMIT?  Yes, however there are IU data compliance requirements and training (see above for training requirements based on Work Groups). All WebAdMIT Users must be FERPA compliant and complete the User Acceptance Agreement.  What WebAdMIT tools are available for admission committee reviewers and interviewers?  WebAdMIT allows you the ability to create “Assignments” and/or “Interview” electronic forms for your admissions committee to complete and submit for assigned applicants. You can design and implement your own applicant evaluation process in WebAdMIT. See Reviewing Applicants  [Reviewing Applicants](https://help.liaisonedu.com/WebAdMIT_Help_Center/WebAdMIT_Manual/Reviewing_Applicants )  Also, Visit the Quick Start Guide . This site will provide how-to videos and step-by-step guides on the review process in WebAdMIT.  [Visit the Quick Start Guide](https://help.liaisonedu.com/WebAdMIT_Help_Center/Getting_Started/WebAdMIT_Quick_Start_Guides/02_Quick_Start_Guide_for_Reviewers_and_Interviewers)  How do we track waitlisted applicants?  You can create a program specific Local Status for this, but you will need to process an admissions decision prior to the end of each CAS cycle. Be sure to connect your newly created Local Status to the “Internal Review” decision code!  [Local Status](https://help.liaisonedu.com/WebAdMIT_Help_Center/WebAdMIT_Manual/Managing_Your_Applicant_Pool/01_Local_Statuses)  How do we record and track student decisions?  The use of Custom Fields in WebAdMIT is most commonly used to track the applicant’s response to an offer.  [Custom Fields](https://help.liaisonedu.com/WebAdMIT_Help_Center/WebAdMIT_Manual/Reviewing_Applicants/3._Custom_Fields)  Will we have the ability to track student decisions, required orientation materials and RSVPs?  With the use of Custom Fields that you create in the Configuration Portal these items can be tracked and if needed, admission users can upload these documents to the application in WebAdMIT.  [Custom Fields](https://help.liaisonedu.com/WebAdMIT_Help_Center/WebAdMIT_Manual/Reviewing_Applicants/3._Custom_Fields)  How do we deny admissions in WebAdMIT?  If the applicant has not yet been admitted in WebAdMIT, your admissions staff will select the “Deny” Local Status, which is tied to the “Deny” Decision Code, and this will load to SIS overnight.  What should I do if an applicant withdraws their application?  If the applicant has not yet been admitted in WebAdMIT, you can utilize the Applicant Withdrawn local status and it will write to SIS overnight.  If the applicant has already been admitted, you will need to contact your graduate admissions office to update the decision in the IU systems.  How do I defer an applicant’s admission to a future term in WebAdMIT ?  It depends. If it is for a term within the same CAS cycle you will do this using the Manual Designation function in WebAdMIT, assuming that application (Q4) exists.  [Manual Designation](https://help.liaisonedu.com/WebAdMIT_Help_Center/WebAdMIT_Manual/Managing_Your_Applicant_Pool/02_Manual_Designations)  If the applicant would like to defer to a term in the next CAS cycle, it is best to have them reapply in the new cycle. You can utilize a coupon code in order to waive the fee for the new application.  [reapply](https://help.liaisonedu.com/Indiana_University_Graduate_CAS_Applicant_Help_Center/Starting_Your_Indiana_University_Graduate_CAS_Application/Creating_and_Managing_Your_Indiana_University_Graduate_CAS_Account/02_Use_an_Existing_Account_to_Re-Apply)  If the applicant has applied to the 20-21 CAS cycle and would like to defer to the next CAS cycle, you can also use the “Defer – next CAS Cycle” Local Status to move the application to the next cycle. You can use this option as long as that same program/plan/term combination is available in the next CAS cycle and you select this option before the launch of the 21-22 cycle. To fully understand it is best to review the Workflow Basics Webinar recording and / or view the slides .  [Workflow Basics Webinar recording](https://iu.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/8.22.19+WebAdMIT+Workflow+-+The+Basics+Training+%28IUPUI+Campus+Trainers%29/1_4fusslfn)  [view the slides](https://graduate.iupui.edu/doc/faculty-staff/UniCAS/UniCAS-workflow-the-basics.pdf)  ***For international student applications, please note the deferral process requires different steps. You will need to reach out directly to oiagrad@iupui.edu for special instructions on how to defer to prevent delays in processing.  Can I download the application as a PDF?  Yes, you can download the application as a PDF from the Documents section of WebAdMIT. This PDF will contain the application and any documents uploaded by the applicant. Please note that it will not contain any documents uploaded directly into WebAdMIT by admissions processors within IU.  Can I see the status of an application for other programs or just the designations I have been granted access to?  Users will only see the status of applications for the programs they have access to.  Where can I find the CAS / admissions decision codes?  The IU Graduate CAS Workflow Training document include s decision codes.  I see STOP - Compliance Review Pending Local Status on an applicant in WebAdMIT. What does this mean?  If you see this Local Status on one of your applicants in WebAdMIT, this indicates a HARD STOP. The Office of Research Compliance has put into place processes / procedures to comply with the federal government’s requirements concerning inappropriate foreign influence. As a result, there is a NEW Military Service / Security Agency Question Set and Workflow for 2021-22 IU Graduate CAS Application. Please review the department training document in full.   ## Application and Operational Questions  Will the applicant’s University ID be listed in WebAdMIT?  Yes. You can find the university ID in the Applicant Header at the top of the Applicant Details Page, and in the Custom Questions section once the applicant has submitted their application and the data has loaded to SIS PeopleSoft. This is typically an overnight process.  The Program / Plan / Subplan / Term found in the Custom Fields panel of the Applicant Details Page in WebAdMIT reflects the most recent CAS application, which may not be your program. The IU Core Team is submitting fix request to Liaison.  Can incomplete applications and their status be viewed in WebAdMIT?  Yes, admissions users will be able to see the status of an application if the applicant has selected a designation you have access to. Applications not yet submitted appear in WebAdMIT with the Application Status of “In Progress”.  You can only add a Local Status that you have created to manage “In Progress” applicants. You cannot add a Local Status that is tied to a decision code to an “In Progress” application. See Application Status Reference Guide for more details  [Application Status Reference Guide](https://help.liaisonedu.com/WebAdMIT_Help_Center/Documents_and_Reference_Guides/Application_Statuses_Reference_Guide)  Will I be able to track non-native English speaking applicants?  Yes, you can find all bio/demo questions asked in the Indiana University Graduate CAS on the Applicant Details page under Personal Information and in the full application PDF.  Will application materials be loaded into Liaison in real time?  Applications are pushed over to WebAdMIT from the applicant portal as part of a batch process.  It is possible, depending on the activity in progress, that the applications will not display in WebAdMIT for an hour or two after submission. \"In Progress\" application data is displayed in WebAdMIT based on certain \"trigger\" actions by the applicant.  What is the application fee?  The fee is set at the program level.  How is an application fee waived?  There are three ways you can waive an application fee.  NOTE: For every coupon code used, you will not receive application fees. Unused coupon codes that have expired cannot be used in new CAS cycles. You will only be charged for used codes.  To request a batch of coupons, please complete the Indiana University Graduate CAS Coupon Code Request form .  [Indiana University Graduate CAS Coupon Code Request form](https://survey.graduate.iu.edu/machform/view.php?id=57248)  The department would be billed the processing fee quarterly based on each application submitted with the fee waived.  For more information on Coupon Codes and setting your application fee at $0 see the IU Graduate CAS Fee Waiver Training document for more details.  [Coupon Codes](https://survey.graduate.iu.edu/machform/view.php?id=57248)  [CAS Fee Waiver Training document](https://graduate.iupui.edu/doc/faculty-staff/UniCAS/UniCAS-fee-waiver-training.pdf)  Can applicants apply to multiple programs using the same application?  Applicants can apply to multiple programs through the same application by selecting a new program from the “Add Program” tab within the applicant portal. This will generate a new Program Materials (Q4) section for the applicant to complete.  How do we direct applicants to our program in the IU Grad CAS?  A list of programs accepting applications appears for applicants on the “Add Program” tab in the IU Graduate CAS. The list includes: campus; program name, program degree level, start term, start year, school, delivery (on campus, hybrid, online), and deadline.  Applicants will be able to filter by campus and search by program name/term. Using the “Add Program” tab of the IU Graduate CAS will allow them to add multiple programs much like they would an online shopping cart. If you would like to direct your applicants to a the “Add Program” tab pre-filtered with only your campus applications, we strongly recommend you utilize your campus deep link .  [campus deep link](https://help.liaisonedu.com/WebAdMIT_Help_Center/Configuration_Portal/Accessing_Your_Programs#Working_with_Deep_Links)  Will we have the ability to track program specific application materials in WebAdMIT?  Yes, you can do this with the Requirements function , or with the use of custom fields that you design in the Configuration Portal . A dmission users can upload additional scanned documents to the application in WebAdMIT and attach them to the applications electronic record or \"Applicant Details\" Page.  [Requirements function](https://help.liaisonedu.com/WebAdMIT_Help_Center/WebAdMIT_Manual/Reviewing_Applicants/4._Requirements)  [custom fields](https://help.liaisonedu.com/WebAdMIT_Help_Center/WebAdMIT_Manual/Reviewing_Applicants/3._Custom_Fields)  You can also easily communicate with your applicants to inform them what application materials you still need from them utilizing the mail merge feature.  [mail merge feature.](https://help.liaisonedu.com/WebAdMIT_Help_Center/WebAdMIT_Manual/Corresponding_with_Applicants)  Will transcripts be sent to Liaison for processing?  No, you will process transcripts as you currently do. However, applicants can upload their unofficial transcript in Quadrant 2 when they enter their university / college details. The upload is optional. If you would like to require unofficial transcripts you can add instructions on your home page within your Quadrant 4 (Q4).  Will we be able to use the Liaison transcript evaluation tool?  No, this was not a service purchased by Indiana University.  How do students submit test scores?  Official test score submission will remain the same. The most recent official test scores for the following standardized tests will be imported from SIS to WebAdMIT two times a week.  Once supporting materials have been submitted, will applicants be able to update this information?  Document uploads in Q1 – Q3 are set as optional due to the decentralized nature of the graduate and professional application process. Optional uploads, including those in Q4, allow applicants to submit their application without uploading documents. Applicants can login at a later date and upload documents, if there is an open document upload available. Applicants cannot edit or remove a document previously submitted, but are able to contact the Applicant Help Center for assistance changing out a document:  Email: graduate.indiana@liaisoncas.com  Phone: 617-729-2866  If a document upload is set in the Q4 Configuration Portal to “required” an applicant must upload it prior to submission. They cannot submit an updated version through the Applicant Portal after they have submitted their application unless they contact the Applicant Help Center.  What if hard copy application materials are mailed to our office, can we scan and upload them to WebAdMIT?  Yes, you can scan the materials and upload it to the applicant’s record in WebAdMIT in the “Admissions Uploaded Documents” section. This can allow for a paperless application review. A maximum of 8 files can by uploaded to this section. You may need to merge multiple documents.  Please note, materials uploaded by your staff are not visible to applicants and will not appear in the full application PDF. PDFs are retained for 3 years in WebAdMIT.  What is the process when an applicant applies to the wrong program?  In WebAdMIT, an admissions user will have the ability to add an additional designation (application from the same campus) to an applicant record using the Manual Designation feature, assuming the user has access to the new designation . The applicant’s Local Status must be updated to “Program/Term Change”. Admissions users can then pull lists based on this Local Status to identify which new applications should be reviewed, and processed through admission workflow.  [Manual Designation](https://help.liaisonedu.com/WebAdMIT_Help_Center/WebAdMIT_Manual/Managing_Your_Applicant_Pool/02_Manual_Designations)  A list titled “Program/Term Change” has been created for admission users and can be found on the left side of the dashboard under the Application List tab. The list is pulling off of the Local Status and can be used to track applicants with the Local Status of “Program/Term Change”. Note, that there are some pitfalls to doing this. Please review the Workflow Basics webinar and slides before utilizing this option. We encourage programs to provide a coupon code and ask the student to apply to the correct program. The applicant will only need to complete the new Q4.  [Workflow Basics webinar](https://iu.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/8.22.19+WebAdMIT+Workflow+-+The+Basics+Training+%28IUPUI+Campus+Trainers%29/1_4fusslfn)  If our applicant has applied to another CAS maintained by Liaison, can their application be copied to our IU Graduate CAS?  Unfortunately, no; however, applicants can utilize the same user name and login.  When will my applications be available to applicants?  Program representatives responsible for configuring programs determine the Start Date, Deadline, and the Display Deadline. The application will not automatically display until the Start Date. After the Deadline has passed, that program option will no longer automatically display on the Add a Program page. Programs can display a date that is before the actual deadline to motivate applicants to move forward with the process.  The application will still be available until the actual deadline comes.  Future, Past, and Available programs can be seen utilizing the filter option on the “Add Program” tab.  A department can then use an invitation code to allow for late applications after the actual deadline. These invitation codes are single use. See Invitation Code How-To guide for more information.  [invitation code](https://survey.graduate.iu.edu/machform/view.php?id=57248 )  In addition, after the CAS cycle has closed, applications will no longer be allowed for the program in that cycle.  What happens if a recommender declines to provide a recommendation for a student?  If a recommender declines, the applicant receives a notification of this information and the applicant can log back into the IU Graduate CAS, remove the recommender and add contact details for a new recommender.  Can the same recommender be used more than once by a student?  Recommenders can receive and complete multiple requests from a student but not for the same program.  Does the application have to be submitted for the recommenders to receive the email notifications?  No, the application does not have to be submitted. The email request will go out immediately after the applicant adds the evaluator’s information to their account. Request can be monitored by departments but only an applicant can resubmit the request to a recommender.  What if an applicant does not waive their rights to view their recommendations?  If an applicant chooses to be able to view their recommendations, they will need to reach out directly to their recommenders for a copy of their recommendation. They will not be able to view this information in their applicant portal.  I noticed that in the behavior disclosure section there is no field to upload a statement to explain.  Where will these statements be uploaded?  Instructions are provided for the applicant in Q1 to upload this information in the document section of their application (the Supporting Information quadrant). Instructions listed: “Please provide an explanation and attach any relevant documentation in the Documents section of the application.”   ## Communications and Emails  When an application is submitted, can an automated email be sent to the applicant letting them know that the application has been received?  Yes. A general email will be sent to each applicant once they successfully submit their application. This email is customized at the University level and will not be specific to a campus/program. We welcome Admissions Users to follow up with a program-specific customized email utilizing templates created by your staff in WebAdMIT.  When an evaluation (recommendation) is received, can an automated “Thank You” email be sent to the recommender?  Yes, an email is automatically sent to the recommender to inform them the recommendation has been submitted and the applicant has been notified. This is not customizable by program.  Is there a process to generate decision letters?  Using the email feature combined with the custom fields you created in WebAdMIT, decision letters can be generated to applicants as part of the admissions process. You have the ability to create email templates and utilize a mail merge feature to communicate with your applicants.  [email feature](https://help.liaisonedu.com/WebAdMIT_Help_Center/WebAdMIT_Manual/Corresponding_with_Applicants)  [custom fields](https://help.liaisonedu.com/WebAdMIT_Help_Center/WebAdMIT_Manual/Reviewing_Applicants/3._Custom_Fields)  How do we acknowledge the applicant’s decision?  Using the email feature combined with the custom fields you created in WebAdMIT, email messages can be generated to applicants as part of the admissions process. You have the ability to create email templates and utilize a mail merge feature to communicate with your applicants.  [email feature](https://help.liaisonedu.com/WebAdMIT_Help_Center/WebAdMIT_Manual/Corresponding_with_Applicants)  [custom fields](https://help.liaisonedu.com/WebAdMIT_Help_Center/WebAdMIT_Manual/Reviewing_Applicants/3._Custom_Fields)  Will we have the ability to communicate with applicants about their status in WebAdMIT?  Using the email feature combined with Local Statuses and custom fields in WebAdMIT you can also easily communicate with your applicants to inform them what application materials you still need from them utilizing the mail merge feature.  [email feature](https://help.liaisonedu.com/WebAdMIT_Help_Center/WebAdMIT_Manual/Corresponding_with_Applicants)  [Local Statuses](https://help.liaisonedu.com/WebAdMIT_Help_Center/WebAdMIT_Manual/Managing_Your_Applicant_Pool/01_Local_Statuses)  [custom fields](https://help.liaisonedu.com/WebAdMIT_Help_Center/WebAdMIT_Manual/Reviewing_Applicants/3._Custom_Fields)  Does the Liaison portal interface with the Salesforce Graduate Pillar?  There is an hourly data integration between IU’s instance of Salesforce and SIS PeopleSoft. Applications submitted through the IU Graduate CAS will be imported into SIS PeopleSoft at two points in the CAS Cycle, once at submission, and then at the time an admissions decision is made. SIS PeopleSoft data will then populate in Salesforce.   ## Utilizing Reports and IUIE  Will I be able to pull customized reports?  Yes, you can create reports in WebAdMIT. Below you will see a list of pertinent trainings.  Lists and Report Tutorials  [Creating Reports](https://help.liaisonedu.com/WebAdMIT_Help_Center/WebAdMIT_Manual/Extracting_Data_from_WebAdMIT/Creating_Reports)  [Exporting Data](https://help.liaisonedu.com/WebAdMIT_Help_Center/WebAdMIT_Manual/Extracting_Data_from_WebAdMIT/Exporting_Data)  [List Manager – Field Lists](https://help.liaisonedu.com/WebAdMIT_Help_Center/WebAdMIT_Manual/Searching_For_Your_Applicants/02_List_Manager_Field_Lists)  [List Manager – Composite Lists](https://help.liaisonedu.com/WebAdMIT_Help_Center/WebAdMIT_Manual/Searching_For_Your_Applicants/03_List_Manager_Composite_Lists)  [WebAdMIT On Demand Courses](https://help.liaisonedu.com/WebAdMIT_Help_Center/WebAdMIT_Training/02_On-demand_Courses)  Can I still use IUIE for reporting?  You can still utilize IUIE for SIS PeopleSoft-sourced application reports. In addition, Liaison delivers their own reporting functionality for application information in the WebAdMIT portal. Be aware that you may need to update certain fields in the IUIE reports to pull in WebAdMIT information.  Data reporting from old eApp-sourced IUIE reports will only hold application information from the old eApp (i.e. eApp GRAD Notifications, Application Response, and any field with eApp in the name in other reports).  I am in the Department API Team Work Group. Where can I find resources to aid me in pulling our admissions data out of WebAdMIT?  Application Program Interface (API) is a technical term for pulling admissions data out of WebAdMIT into another database automatically and on a set schedule. You will find the API Instructions provided by Liaison . Note, that this requires a highly technical skill set, and Indiana University and Liaison do not provide API support. For training and tutorials visit the Department API Team training requirements found in the Tutorials and Resources section above.

    "body": " Each degree granting program of The University Graduate School nominates one truly outstanding Master’s thesis from each category* for consideration by a committee of faculty reviewers for The University Graduate School Distinguished Master’s Thesis Award. The Awards Committee of the Graduate Faculty Council considers such criteria as originality, documentation, significance, accuracy, organization, and style. Awards are provided to students at $1,500 each, with one recipient at Indiana University Bloomington and two for IUPUI this year.  *2023 categories are: 1) Humanities, 2) Biological/Life Sciences  2023 Award Recipients  Madeline Hellmich and Kayleigh Jennings were recently recognized with the 2023 award for IUPUI. Hellmich won in the humanities category (School of Liberal Arts, Public History) and Jennings (School of Medicine, Medical and Molecular Genetics) won in the Biological/Life Sciences category (School of Science, clinical psychology).   #### Madeline Hellmich  Years of research and study led Hellmich, a public history master’s student, to her thesis, “Systemic Anti-Black Violence in Indiana: A Digital Public History Wikipedia Project.” In a nomination letter by Rebecca Shrum, Ph.D., director of public history, Shrum indicated Hellmich’s project has “the potential to make a difference in our country’s ongoing struggle for racial justice.”  Shrum continued with, “The significance of truth and reconciliation movements around the globe motivated Ms. Hellmich’s works as she uncovered the centuries of white silence surrounding the atrocities committed against Black citizens in Indiana.”  Hellmich, originally from Greensburg, Indiana, states, “I knew the racism and racist violence that Hoosiers were experiencing and combatting in the present was connected to Indiana’s racist past, including the racist violence and lynchings that took place in sundown towns like the one I grew up in.”  Hellmich started graduate school in the fall of 2020 and was inspired by the racial justice movement that emerged in the U.S. in the summer of 2020. With that in mind, her advice to graduate students is: “If there is a current issue that you feel passionate about and you want to help respond to it, listen to community members, civic leaders, and faculty and staff who are already working on solutions. Then, see if there is a way you can work together.”  Beyond the important findings of her research, Hellmich took her thesis one step further. With a desire to share her research broadly, she turned to Wikipedia, acknowledging in a blog entitled, Practicing public history on Wikipedia “historians have a long and complicated relationship with it.” Though not an easy endeavor, Hellmich wrote in her blog, that the space allowed her and other professional historians the opportunity to “interact, debate, evaluate, and change the historical record in real time.”  [Practicing public history on Wikipedia](https://ncph.org/history-at-work/practicing-public-history-on-wikipedia/)     #### Kayleigh Jennings  Jenning’s research for her thesis, “FGF23 Control of HOX Expression and Function and Implications for CKD,” is designed to improve outcomes for people with chronic kidney disease, which affects about 10% of the population worldwide.  Kenneth White, PhD., professor in the department of medical and molecular genetics of the IU School of Medicine, explains in his nomination letter, the significance of FGF23: “FGF23 is a hormone secreted from bone that controls metabolic phosphate and vitamin D synthesis in the mammalian kidney. FGF23 dysregulation can lead to sever metabolic disorders, and its overexpression is a common characteristic of CKD.”  Erica Clinkenbeard, Ph.D., an assistant professor in the department of medical and molecular genetics, explained in her nomination letter: “Kayleigh’s studies focused on FGF23-mediated gene and chromatin accessibility changes, specifically investigating the genes elucidated from the single cell datasets. An ultimate goal of these studies is to identify new targets for the control of phosphate metabolism that may be beneficial for patients with CKD.”  Clinkenbeard states, from early interactions with Jennings, “Kayleigh exuded an enthusiasm for research and was highly engaged in lab meetings… she was inquisitive, absorbing the information allowing her to quickly acquire the background knowledge of the lab.”  Jennings offers the following advice to students: “Join a lab as an undergraduate researcher in your chosen field, if possible. I found working in a lab allowed for better hands-on application of classroom lessons and it has greatly improved my education.”  Jennings is a central Indiana native and works as a research assistant in Dr. White’s lab.  Congratulations to our 2023 Distinguished Master's Award Winners!   ### Previous Award Winners   ## 2022 Award Recipients  2022 Award Recipients Sheetal Prasanna and Danielle Abel were recently recognized with the 2022 award for IUPUI. Prasanna won in the mathematics, physical sciences, and engineering category (School of Engineering, electric and computer engineering) and Abel won in the Social Sciences category (School of Science, clinical psychology).     #### Sheetal Prasanna  Prasanna’s thesis, “Sensor Fusion in Neural Networks for Object Detection,” focuses on machine learning for object detection using automotive images, radar and lidar data.  According to one of Prasanna’s reviewers, Maher Rizkalla, Ph.D., “Her contribution to novel approaches, leading to compensating for the lack of data from camera and radar fusion network is significant…Her presentation was among the best I have seen. Her contribution has been pending the publication in a high impact factor journal.”  Rizkalla also wrote, “[Prasanna] achieved a perfect cumulative GPA, and was among the Top 100 Award and Elite 50 at IUPUI. She [also] received a number of awards, including Chancellors’ Scholarship, University Fellowship, and Tau Beta Pi Scholarship.”  Mohammed El-Sharkawy, Ph.D., Prasanna’s major research advisor for her master’s Thesis wrote, “By assisting the team to develop an android application to alert drivers of traffic slowdowns, Sheetal proved herself to be a skilled engineer as well as a team player.”  After interning for three summers with Aptiv, a global automotive company that aims to develop safer, greener, and more connected solutions for mobility, Prassana was hired as a full-time engineer by Aptiv after her graduation in May 2022.       #### Danielle Abel  One of Abel’s reviewers, Michelle Salyer, Ph.D., described Abel’s thesis, “Investigation of Social Dysfunction and Affect in Schizophrenia,” as truly outstanding. “Danielle sought to answer two important research questions regarding the nature of social functioning in people with schizophrenia…The study was well-designed and innovative. Danielle used a multimethod assessment of social behavior to produce high quality data.”  In describing the construction of Abel’s study, Salyer added, “She begins with a broad overview to engage the reader to understand the big picture of what the study is addressing and why we should care. This is followed by a detailed and directed literature review to lead the reader to the study design and how she is addressing clear gaps in the literature.”  Abel’s primary research mentor since she joined IUPUI clinical psychology doctoral program in 2018, Kyle Minor, Ph.D., wrote, “During her time at IUPUI, Danielle has excelled: she has demonstrated impressive conceptual skills and ranks at the very top of doctoral students who have come through our program – a particularly high bar given the excellent credentials of this comparison group.” Minor continues with, “Danielle’s dissertation is an innovative real-world study that explores how different aspects of social interactions are related to predicted and experienced pleasure of those interactions in schizophrenia.”  Perhaps the basis of awarding Abel this prestigious award is best summed up by Minor’s statement: “At this early stage, Danielle is already laying a solid foundation for a career as an independent scientist.”   ## 2021 Award Recipients  2021 Award Recipients Ivette Muzquiz and Jill Weiss Simins were recognized with the 2021 award for IUPUI. Muzquiz won in the biological/life sciences category (School of Engineering, Biomedical) and Weiss won in the humanities category (School of Liberal Arts, History).     #### Ivette Muzquiz  Muzquiz’s thesis, “Reversible Nerve Conduction Block Using Low Frequency Alternating Currents,” focused on the exploration of a phenomenon discovered in Dr. Ken Yoshida’s lab involving nerve conduction block elicited using direct nerve electrical stimulation using a novel stimulation waveform.  As Muzquiz’s thesis advisor, Dr. Yoshida wrote, “Ivette’s research involved the translation of Low Frequency Alternating Current Block to live animals, and determining whether the nerve block was capable of eliciting a measureable change in organ function. In her work, she demonstrated that the waveforms functionally blocked neural signals that slowed heart rate and reduced breathing rate in anaesthetized rats and pigs respectively.”  Dr. Yoshida also wrote, “Extraordinarily, Ivette managed to complete this technically challenging experimental work and MS degree during the time of virtual learning, and campus closures due to the Global Pandemic. Beyond being exceptionally organized in planning her research time and course time, Ivette is exceptionally bright and talented.”  Muzquiz is now an R&D Engineer at Procter & Gamble.     #### Jill Weiss Simins  According to Weiss Simins’ thesis committee chair, Dr. Nancy Robertson, Weiss Simins’ thesis, “’A Little Deviltry’: Gilded Age Celebrity and William Merritt Chase’s Tenth Street Studio as Advertisement,” blended painstaking research into primary sources, a mastery of the relevant scholarly literature from several disciplines, and an innovative “reading” of Chase’s artwork to analyze his rise to prominence against the backdrop of the literal life-and-death struggles of artists of his day.  Another member of her thesis committee, Dr. Robert Patrick Kinsman, wrote, “The thesis is well-written, easy to read, well-footnoted, and combines a broader range of research than most M.A. theses focused on a singular course topic. It adeptly combines historical discourse, art historical analysis, and a more theoretical discussion of celebrity.”  Weiss Simins is a historian at the Indiana Historical Bureau, a division of the Indiana State Library, where she has worked since 2008. Recently, she was recognized with the Dorothy Riker Historian Award, named for Riker, who was a 50-year employee and editor for the Indiana Historical Society and the Indiana Historical Bureau from 1929 to 1979. This award is made annually to a historian who has made distinguished contributions to the field of historical scholarship, including presentation, use of materials and preservation.   ## 2020 Award Recipients  2020 Award Recipients Kelsey Binion and John Burns were recently recognized with the 2020 award for IUPUI. Binion won in the social sciences category (School of Liberal Arts, Communication) and Burns won in the mathematics/physical sciences/engineering category (School of Informatics and Computing, Health Informatics).     #### Kelsey Binion  Binion’s thesis, “Assessing Communication Effectiveness in Interprofessional Healthcare Teams,” focused on assessing communication among health professionals and students in training. Binion’s thesis adviser, Dr. Maria Brann, wrote “Ms. Binion’s thesis is of extremely high quality. [Her] thesis addressed the important trend of interprofessional teamwork in health care interactions… Kelsey’s unique approach allowed her to gather data from standardized patients during a simulation training experience of health care trainees… She recognized how important and valuable interprofessional communication is to the physical and mental health of patients and explored this topic with professionalism and respect for all participants involved.”  Dr. Kristine Karnick, Associate Professor and Chair of the Department of Communication Studies wrote in her letter of nomination, “This thesis is highly original and brings forward a communication perspective, which is often overlooked in the literature, especially in interprofessional practice and education. The thesis focused on an interprofessional simulation, and Ms. Binion analyzed feedback from standardized patients after they engaged with a group of health profession learners. Often, communication in this area is measured by students’ and faculty members’ perceptions and feedback; however, Ms. Binion used a different approach, because she wanted to understand whether communication competencies could be demonstrated and visible to the standardized patients.”  Ms. Binion is currently pursuing a PhD in Health Communication at IUPUI.   ### John Burns  Burns’ thesis, “Instant Messaging Supporting Decision Support Interventions – a Radiologist Centric Study,” was chosen based on the importance of the research, scope and translation, the strength of his data and analysis, as well as his skills in communication and writing.  One of Burns’ thesis committee members and an Assistant Professor in Health Informatics, Saptarshi Purkayastha, PhD., wrote, “[His thesis] contributes greatly to the fields of health informatics and human computer interaction. John identified a clinical problem – humans dislike of current decision support interfaces – and a novel solution in a conversational agent that would work with clinicians as a trusted team member… After an exhaustive literature and patent search, John has filed for design patent for this thesis, and is currently negotiating with clinical software companies to implement this within hospitals. This technology will be a major game changer in how clinicians interact with computers.”  Another thesis committee member, Judy Gichoya, PhD from Emory University, wrote, “The writing is phenomenal. John has made this interesting for radiologists and developers. It is easy to read, organized well, and communicates clearly to the reader. Throughout each step of the scientific process, John kept detailed notes. Every section is thorough without being overwhelming, and every potential finding is explored to its fullest extent.”  Mr. Burns is currently pursuing a PhD in Health and Biomedical Informatics at IUPUI.   ## 2019 Award Recipients  Landon Crouse and Kyle Haas were recently recognized with the 2019 award for IUPUI. Crouse won in the humanities category (History) and Haas won in the biological/life sciences category (Electrical and Computer Engineering).    Landon Crouse  Crouse’s thesis is entitled, “Engelbert of Admont's De Regimine Principum and Lex Animata: A study in the Eclecticism of the Medieval Aristotelian Political Tradition” which is based on his analysis of the eighteenth-century printed edition of the Latin text of Engelbert of Admont’s De Regimine Principum. Crouse’s mentor, Eric L. Saak, Ph.D., wrote “Mr. Crouse’s [thesis] stands out above all the others with respect to scholarly erudition and sophistication, independence of research, requisite scholarly skills, and contribution to scholarship… In other words, Mr. Crouse’s thesis is in extremely rare company indeed. It is a very impressive piece of work.”  Another faculty member, Elizabeth Thill, Ph.D., wrote in her letter of nomination, “Classical studies is by its nature an interdisciplinary field, combining numerous methodological means of analysis (historical, linguistics, translation, archaeology) within a complex field of evidence…Given that Mr. Crouse selected as his subject a Latinist writing on Ancient Greek philosophy, he took up the mantle of a Classicist, as well as a historian. I can attest he wore the mantle ably.”  Crouse has applied to both Notre Dame’s History Graduate Program and their Medieval Institute in order to pursue a PhD in Medieval Studies. Upon acceptance to and completion of either program, he would like to continue researching and writing about medieval intellectual history, teach it at the university level, and achieve a full professorship.    Kyle Haas  Haas’ thesis is entitled, “Transfer Learning for Medication Adherence Prediction from Social Forums Self-Reported Data” and was selected for the award by a panel of faculty from the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department using criteria based on the scope and importance of the research, the strength of his data and statistical analysis, and excellence in writing. Haas’ thesis focused on a machine learning model which uses social media data to predict a patient’s medication adherence.  According to his advisor, Zina Ben Miled, Ph.D., Haas had two summer and one fall internship at Eli Lilly & Company. As part of his research work at Lilly, Haas published two conference papers: one was published in the 2018 ACM International Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, and Health Informatics; and the other was published in the 2019 AMIA Summits on Translational Science.  Miled also wrote in a letter of nomination, “The approach he proposed allows the cost-effective identification of patients at-risk of medication non-adherence in a general population. His approach can extend health forums such as Patients-Like-Me with predictive services for medication adherence. He demonstrated and validated his approach for fibromyalgia and diabetes.”  After graduation, Haas joined Eli Lilly and Company as a senior analysist in research data sciences and engineering.   ## 2018 Award Recipients  Miji Um, a PhD student in the Clinical Psychology program, was one of two students recently recognized with The University Distinguished Master’s Thesis Award. Mawla Boaks, a former student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering program, was the other recipient.    Miji Um  Um’s thesis is entitled “Resting-state neural circuit correlates of negative urgency: A comparison between tobacco users and non-tobacco users.” Negative urgency is an impulsivity trait describing a tendency to act rashly under extreme negative emotions and is strongly related to tobacco use. However, smoking cessation strategies have been unsuccessful in initial quitting and continued abstinence. Given the strong association between negative urgency and tobacco use, she chose this topic to identify preliminary brain-based targets for negative urgency that may provide a novel avenue to design and test innovative pharmacological or physiological interventions to assist tobacco cessation efforts.  IUPUI faculty who reviewed Um’s thesis commented on sophistication of the writing, quality of work, her attention to detail on par with a more advanced doctoral student, her extraordinary efforts in gaining proficiency in MRI analysis, and her independence in reviewing the literature and data analysis. Um’s work has been presented at 17 meetings and conferences including state and national meetings focus on tobacco use and smoking. She is also a co-author on 12 published manuscripts including a first author book chapter related to her thesis.  Um’s mentor wrote: “Sometimes I had to remind myself that this was Ms. Um’s thesis and not her dissertation! She completed this study in less than a year, which is quite impressive, given the amount of work the project required and the sophisticated nature of the analyses and interpretation of the data.”  Um’s career goal is to become an independent academic researcher, investigating the behavioral and neuroscientific evidence underlying emotion-based impulsivity, and leveraging this evidence to develop intervention strategies for substance use disorders that directly target emotion-based impulsivity. Um has received a competitive F31 predoctoral research training fellowship from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism to support her dissertation research that examines the relationship between positive urgency and alcohol-related risk-taking using alcohol administration and emotion induction methods as well as complex whole-brain connectomic analyses using resting-state fMRI data.    Mawla Boaks  Boaks' thesis is entitled “Density Functional Theory (DFT) Study of Hydrogen Storage in Porous Silicon.” Boaks' research and thesis focus on the movement of hydrogen from a gas phase to a solid on catalytically modified porous silicon as a means of energy storage and transmission. Boaks discovered that a small cluster of palladium atoms applied to a nano-scale silicon matrix, can mediate hydrogen phase transition and storage. His laboratory work was dependent on many hours of computational analysis using our institutional Big Red II computer, but as pointed out by his thesis mentor – time well spent given the magnitude of his discoveries. Boaks' thesis studies have led to 3 patents and a grant to his mentor from the National Science Foundation. His mentor and several of his committee commented in their nomination on the clarity of his thesis and that the thesis is currently being avidly read by other students and scholars working to extend this novel technology.  IUPUI faculty who reviewed Boaks' thesis commented on the importance of his laboratory studies as well as his unique application of computational analysis using Density Functional Theory to examine a 3D structure. They noted the high quality of his work, the clarity of explanations allowing easy interpretation by others, and real world applications of his discoveries documented in the thesis. A faculty member commented that “This research is vitally important to the next generation of solid state devices and energy storage systems.”  After graduating, Boaks moved to Utah to pursue a PhD at Brigham Young University. His current research focus is on 3D printed microfluidics. After obtaining his PhD, he intends to do research as his full-time job and will look for a job in R&D as a research scientist.   ## 2017 Award Recipient    Janice Miller  Janice Miller, a former IUPUI graduate student from the Department of History in the School of Liberal Arts was recently recognized with The University Graduate School Distinguished Master’s Thesis Award. Every year, each degree granting program of The University Graduate School may nominate one “truly outstanding” Master’s thesis for consideration by a committee of faculty reviewers. Annually, only two recipients are selected for this prestigious award from among the many IU and IUPUI students nominated.  Miller completed her MA in History at IUPUI in September 2016 with her thesis entitled “In Brighter Colors: Fauvist Influences and Gender Politics in the Art of Gabriele Münter.” She chose this topic “to highlight the career of a female German Expressionist artist, Gabriele Münter (1877-1962), who has been largely underrepresented in art historical discourse. As is so often the case with women artists, Münter's artistic endeavors had remained eclipsed by those of her companion, Russian artist Wassily Kandinsky,” said Miller.  IUPUI faculty who reviewed Miller’s thesis commented on the excellent organization, syntax, grammar and spelling within the document. One noted that: [The thesis] “is interdisciplinary in focus, equally a work of art history as well as cultural and intellectual history.” A member of Miller’s research advisory committee commented, “Ms. Miller dedicated herself to her Master’s research with an extraordinary level of commitment - a dedication that one would expect more of a doctoral candidate than a Master’s student.” One of Miller’s committee members is encouraging Janice to write a book based on sections of her thesis and indicates in a letter that this will require little revision. This faculty member also writes: “I truly believe this research merits a wider audience and would attract a readership.”  Miller said her research changed drastically when she made the crucial observation that Gabriele Münter's Expressionist work aligns very closely with the style of the French Fauves, a concurrent artistic movement led by Henri Matisse.  “This stylistic plurality demonstrates Münter's skillful judgment and reinterpretation of artistic movements beyond Germany. Together with my thesis advisor, Dr. Kevin C. Robbins, I embarked on an ambitious project to prove that Münter was not only an exceptional German Expressionist, but also the finest female German Fauve operating in early twentieth-century Europe. It is my hope that this reinvestigation of Münter's extensive oeuvre will prompt scholars to revisit the creative output of twentieth-century female artists,” Miller stated.  As a result of the award, Miller was chosen as The University Graduate School’s nominee from IUPUI for the Midwest Association of Graduate Schools 2018 Distinguished Master’s Thesis Awards. The 74th annual conference will be held from April 4-6 in Grand Rapids, Michigan next year. Miller will also present her research on Gabriele Münter at the 2018 American Historical Association Annual Meeting in Washington, DC.  Miller received her bachelor’s degree from IUPUI within the Herron School of Art and Design. She is currently teaching German Expressionism and Art History courses as an adjunct faculty member in the Herron School. She plans to pursue a Ph.D. but will first take a break from student life to pursue research and professional opportunities.   ## 2016 Award Recipients    Abby Curtin Teare  Curtin Teare’s thesis, “Rethinking Landscape Interpretation: Form, Function, and Meaning of the Garfield Farm, 1876-1905”, stood out for its “depth of research, creativity, and sophistication,” according to one of her thesis committee reviewers.  Another reviewer wrote, “Abby Curtin has demonstrated how a thorough collection of historic documents related to the political, social, and agricultural history of one Midwestern farm and its family presents an opportunity to share with the general public... an important chapter in American history when farms become suburbs.”  Curtin Teare said the history program prepared her well for her current role as Grants Manager at the Cleveland History Center. “IUPUI's public history program gave me rigorous training in academic history as well as practical experience working for two public history institutions in Indianapolis. I've found that the research, writing, and project management skills I used to balance my studies and my internship schedule has prepared me for my current position, which requires me to manage the museum's grants calendar and write proposals and reports.”    Karim (right) with Nobel Prize Winner Mohammed Yunus at an International Poverty Conference in Washington D.C. Karim received a travel grant to speak about his work in Indonesia, as well as about his research on homelessness in Indianapolis.  Karim’s thesis, “Leaving the Bridge, Passing the Shelters: Understanding Homeless Activism Through Utilization of Spaces with the Central Public Library and the IUPUI Library in Indianapolis”, ranks as “among the best I have read, and in most respects, it rises to the level of a doctoral dissertation,” according to Karim’s thesis committee chair.  Another member of Karin’s thesis committee wrote, “As an applied anthropologist Karim has provided a rich body of ethnographic data that can be used by a wide range of professionals, such as policy-makers and non-governmental organizations, as they move forward to create more relevant and sensitive programs for homeless populations at the local, regional and national levels.”  Karim explained his work on the thesis “equipped me with valuable experience doing ethnographic research about homeless activism in the City of Indianapolis; this experience has given me a new perspective on poverty and inequality in a more global context.”  Karim is currently an associate planner in the Directorate of Poverty Reduction, the Ministry of National Development Planning (Bappenas) in the Republic of Indonesia.  In choosing winners, the committee considers such criteria as originality, documentation, significance, accuracy, organization and style. To be eligible for the award, nominees must have received their master’s degree between July 1, 2014 and June 30, 2015. Each winner received a $1,500 stipend and will be recognized at an April 11, 2016 awards reception. "

Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  The IUPUI Museum Studies program drew me in with its multi-disciplinary approach to educating future museum professionals and emphasis on social awareness and community engagement. I had always known what I wanted to study in graduate school, so I was happy to find a program that had everything I was looking for. Additionally, the resources and support from the University have been amazing. My undergraduate experience was at a much smaller school in a much smaller town, and while that has its benefits I couldn’t be more grateful for the environment and connections I’ve been offered here.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  My favorite experience at IUPUI so far has been completing and installing an exhibit in the Basile Gallery with my exhibit planning and design class. It was a new experience for all of us and the constraints of the pandemic certainly introduced a few roadblocks. It was excellent practice for a future of rolling with the punches, and I know I learned more about that process than I would have had everything gone exactly as originally planned. Regardless of any imperfections, I’m incredibly proud of my team, class, and everything we were able to accomplish.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  The best part about living in Indianapolis so far has been the opportunity to really focus on and appreciate the little things. Some days it’s the grocery store within walking distance and others it’s the fact that there’s almost never any complete silence. I’m sure a lot of us have been spending more time alone than ever before, and I’ve taken that as an opportunity to fill the void with a better understanding of myself and what it means to be part of a community. It may seem excessively abstract or like I’m trying too hard to be profound, but life in Indy so far has really been about accepting not the loss of normalcy but the opportunity to redecide what normal is.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  My main activity this year has been wearing my mask and staying inside. It’s been a good time to pick up some new skills and knowledge that I’m bringing with me when I re-enter the real world. I’m looking into some volunteer opportunities for the Summer and am excited to start as the Curatorial Fellow in the Cultural Arts Gallery in the Campus Center. I’ve actually been interesting in curating for a collegiate audience in particular, and I am looking forward to the chance to work with other IUPUI students. "

    "body": "  ## Dan Shen  The combined graduate program between Purdue University West Lafayette and IUPUI and the wide range of research opportunities on automotive safety were the two main reasons to pursue my PhD degree at IUPUI.   ##### PhD. in Electrical & Computer Engineering  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  The combined graduate program between Purdue University West Lafayette and IUPUI and the wide range of research opportunities on automotive safety were the two main reasons to pursue my PhD degree at IUPUI. Taking advantage of both Purdue and IUPUI gives me a great stage to show my talent and ambitions. Moreover, after receiving my Master’s degree here with Electrical and Computer Engineering, personal experience in how professional and valuable education within the IUPUI ECE department encouraged me to devote myself to research and academic courses.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  The research and project I have done are my favorite academic accomplishment since I have been here. I have fully passed the Qualifying Examination of Purdue ECE department last year and published over 8 conference papers on various interdisciplinary research topics in advanced control for complicated system, data collection and evaluation method for vehicle road departure detection system. I have also received the 29th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles (IV) Symposium Best Poster Paper Awards in June 2018. I am currently working on several more journal and conference papers regarding my research project and my own PhD dissertation.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  I have lived in Indianapolis for over 5 years. The second largest city in the Midwest offers affordable homes, work opportunities and great higher education, and much more! With a reasonable ratio of income and expense, Indianapolis is a perfect city that you can work toward your dreams with a relaxing living style.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  I am now working as research assistant in Transportation Active Safety Institute (TASI) at IUPUI. My research topics are mainly focused on the modeling and control of complicated systems, computer vision and artificial intelligence algorithms. I am very interested in studying these areas and try to keep myself up-to-date with the latest frontier science and technology.  My current research topics and research projects are the development and evaluation of next generation of road departure detection systems (RDDS). Vehicle crashes due to road departure is a leading cause of fatalities on US highways. Roadside accidents and crashes account for about 35 percent of the fatalities on the nation’s highways. Road departure warnings and road keeping assistance (RKA) are the new active safety technologies for solving this problem. Most of the currently developed lane/road departure mitigation systems are based on the detection of clear lane markings. However, many roads do not have lane markings or do not have clear lane markings, especially in some rural and residential areas. Therefore, effective road departure detection and avoidance technologies for autonomous vehicle should rely on the detection and identification of different types of road edge and road boundary objects. Once we know better about the common features of roadside boundaries/objects in the US and the representative road departure pre-crash scenarios, the specific modeling and control strategies will be designed and applied to avoid accident due to run-off road events.

Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I was determined to pursue a career in global health informatics, and wanted to work on a PhD at a university that had the right placement and relationships to help me achieve my goals. I decided very early on that my PhD should be based on ‘doing’, as opposed to learning theoretical concepts in a classroom.  If you want to work on global health get your hands really messy, then IUPUI is the place for you. IUPUI is very strategically placed – their links with IUSM and the Regenstrief Institute open the door for a wide range of options. In my case, the excellent working relationship between these institutions has been very rewarding, and helped me work on everything from nurturing local health informatics capacity in Asia and Africa to helping improve antenatal care in Rwanda, supporting Ebola efforts in Africa and improving public health reporting in the state of Indiana.  [Regenstrief Institute](https://www.regenstrief.org/)  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  Actually, none. There comes a time in everyone’s life when a perfect exam score loses its allure, and I’ve reached that point. On the other hand, over the past year I’ve had the privilege of representing the needs of underserved nations at an international healthcare standards development organization named HL7, and working to ensure that new and upcoming interoperability standards are built in a way that would meet the needs of the poor farmer in Asia and the starving child in Africa. Needless to say that I’m very proud of this little victory.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Being close to mentors who can strongly support my work, and will go out of their way to do so. Being able to benefit from the extensive IU network, and call upon an incredible body of experts who are passionate about what they do, and don’t stop working just because it’s the weekend.  And also, regular visits to the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra thanks to discounted student pricing, enjoying (and critiquing) Herron students and being able to express myself as a writer without having to worry about any political implications.

It was an experience to be relatively isolated from the rest of the world as we camped in tents on the side of the Law Glacier in the Transantarctic Mountains.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I chose to come to IUPUI because of my adviser, Dr. Kathy Licht. While working on my master’s degree at Purdue University, I had the opportunity to take a class that was being jointly taught between Dr. Licht at IUPUI and Dr. Jon Harbor at Purdue. I was very interested in the research that Dr. Licht was doing and was presented with an opportunity to work on an NSF funded project utilizing a variety of research methods to investigate the formation and evolution of a moraine sequence in Antarctica. In addition to the project, the small size of the Earth Sciences Department attracted me.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  I had the opportunity to spend 8 weeks in Antarctica conducting field work for my dissertation research. Three weeks were spent at the United States year-round field station, McMurdo Station, prepping for field work and then processing samples after field work. The other five weeks were spent out in the field collecting data. It was an experience to be relatively isolated from the rest of the world as we camped in tents on the side of the Law Glacier in the Transantarctic Mountains.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  My research is focused on understanding the development and evolution of a blue ice moraine sequence in the central Transantarctic Mountains, Antarctica. As glaciers flow, they entrain debris which is then deposited by the ice. In this case, as ice flow is obstructed by the side of a mountain, it moves up to the surface and sublimates, exposing the debris that it is carrying. As the ice flow continues to be obstructed, younger ice is brought to the surface creating a time transgressive deposit of debris from the debris that was exposed first (oldest) to the debris that is presently being exposed closest to the active ice margin. These moraines potentially contain a record of how the glacier and possibly the ice sheet that the glacier is flowing from have behaved over multiple glacial cycles, but not much is known about how these moraines develop and evolve and the controlling factors. Understanding this will give us an idea of how the ice sheet may have behaved in the past during warming and cooling periods, which will assist with understanding how the ice sheet may change in the future with the trend of climate change.

It’s the cultural and business hub of the state, and it’s been growing and diversifying in exciting ways.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  First of all, I love Indianapolis. It’s the cultural and business hub of the state, and it’s been growing and diversifying in exciting ways. Second, as a social media consultant and former journalist at IndyStar.com, my personal and professional connections here are important to my research at the center of media, law and technology. Most importantly, this department has been very welcoming to a person like myself who is an adult returning student. Both the people and the program have helped me become a success and affirm my new identity as a graduate student.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  Getting the chance from my first semester to co-author a paper with Prof. Sara Anne Hook that was subsequently accepted for publication in the May 2016 edition of the Federal Lawyer, the magazine of the American Bar Association, and we were able to travel to present our work at the 2015 International Conference on Law in Athens, Greece.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  It’s been a terrific place to see grow and change into a world-class city. We have still an affordable quality of life even for Downtown residents like myself, yet many of the cultural amenities of a coastal city like Portland or San Diego (except the ocean!). And I am still close enough to my Illinois-based family and friends here and on the East Coast to easily hop a flight or get in my car to see them.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  My research sits at the center of media, law and technology, informed by my years of print journalism and digital media experience. In my academic studies and my work as a research assistant to SOIC Prof. Sara Anne Hook, I explore legal and ethical concerns with the use of social computing, mobile messaging and “social devices,” or the Internet of Things. We have been fortunate to co-author several well-received publications and presentations in the past year and are planning more.  I also am one of the SOIC students involved with the newly revived IUPUI chapter of Women in Technology. We aim to provide support and encouragement for students who are practicing or considering STEM fields of study, where we are still sadly underrepresented.  I try to make time for community service outside campus, too. Since last fall, I have been a member of the Engagement Committee for Indiana Landmarks, which is the largest private statewide historic-preservation organization in the country as well as my neighbor on the Near-Northside. I’ve been contributing my time and my expertise as they launch a new website, social media, email newsletters and offline efforts to boost involvement, membership and donations. I believe in their mission to help preserve and celebrate the state’s architectural history for this and future generations (I myself live in a historic building, the Mill No. 9 condo development off of Mass Ave.), and I admire their forward-thinking approach on digital engagement.  Finally, I try to give encouragement whenever I can to other professionals who are debating whether to return to school as an adult. I want to help pay forward the advice and support I received when I was mulling whether to make the jump back to college – it’s very scary and easy to get discouraged, because a campus environment is so different than the “real world.” One of the consulting jobs I’m most proud of taking on in my non-academic work is copy-editing the Lumina Foundation’s 2015-16 paper series on outcomes-based funding in higher education, which is partly aimed at boosting successful outcomes for adult returning students such as myself.

It gives me the opportunity to visit different restaurants and try different cuisines. Besides the food, Indianapolis hosts several concerts, comedians and Broadway shows which I enjoy.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  My Master’s thesis was based on sickle cell anemia, and that project got me really interested in the field of hematology. So, when I started applying for graduate schools for my PhD, I was looking out for universities with a strong hematology department. IU School of Medicine’s reputable hematology department with its strong faculty base was the main reason I chose IUPUI.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  There are several academic accomplishments which made me feel that hard work definitely pays off. If I had to pick, my favorite accomplishment so far was my oral presentation at the American Society of Hematology (ASH). This hematology conference is attended by 20,000+ researchers. Presenting my work to experienced and respected peers made me believe in the possibility that any goal is achievable. ASH also has a reputable journal, ‘Blood Advances’ where my very first, 1st author paper was published. Other achievements which gave me a sense of accomplishment include receiving the Merilyn Hester Scholarship, as well as several travel fellowships provided by IU.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Indianapolis is a beautiful city and I love living so close to downtown. It gives me the opportunity to visit different restaurants and try different cuisines. Besides the food, Indianapolis hosts several concerts, comedians and Broadway shows which I enjoy. Going to Murat Theater for ‘The Lion King’ and seeing Trevor Noah live are among the highlights of my time in Indianapolis so far, and I look forward to many more  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC; cells that form all mature blood cells) reside with other cell types in a specialized microenvironment known as the hematopoietic niche. The participating cells within the niche work together to maintain and regulate hematopoiesis. My graduate work in Dr. Edward Srour’s laboratory is based on one such cell type within the HSC niche called an osteomac (protective immune cell). Our previous published work demonstrates how osteomacs interact with osteoblasts (bone forming cells) and megakaryocytes (cells that help wounds clot) to enhance HSC function. Currently, we are attempting to determine the mediators through which these osteomacs enhance hematopoiesis. These mediators could potentially be useful in making bone marrow transplantations more efficient. My graduate work has given me the opportunity to learn several cutting edge techniques such as single cell mRNA sequencing, single cell CyTOF and 3D tissue cytometry. In fact, our lab has taken on the mammoth task of identifying the spatial location of these osteomacs, osteoblasts and megakaryocytes relative to HSC in the unperturbed bone marrow niche using 3D technology. Thanks to Dr. Srour, I have also been given the opportunity to collaborate with several researchers in IU which resulted in multiple peer-reviewed publications.  Outside the lab, I have been a past member of the student diversity advisory board at IUPUI. As an international student, I got to learn a lot about different cultures through the events organized by the department of diversity affairs at IUPUI. I also actively volunteer for IBMG campus visits as well as IUPUI international orientations. "

Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  Cancer research has always been of interest to me. In that regard, Indiana University School of Medicine has the Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center. This is home to several laboratories pursuing exciting work in this field, such as the lab I ended up in, Dr. Tao Lu’s in the Dept. of Pharmacology. Hence, it was a perfect match to my professional career interests and I decided to choose the PhD program here. On a more personal level, Indianapolis (Indy) is a great city to live on a budget. I lived on the West Coast before moving to the Midwest, which made me deeply appreciate the reasonable cost of living here, especially on a graduate student income. For both these reasons, I decided to go to graduate school at IUPUI.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?

Indy has a great mix of people with diverse backgrounds and it has been an absolute pleasure to get to know some of these folks through volunteering and social events in the community. Living in the downtown area with several restaurants, farmers’ markets and local businesses within walking distance has been fun to explore over the past years. Several state parks in the vicinity including Brown County, McCormick’s Creek and Turkey Run as well as the Monon Trail offer an opportunity to get outdoors and away from city life. I also enjoy walking along the downtown canal for some much-needed respite after long days in the lab. Overall, Indy is a great fit for the graduate student lifestyle as it provides most perks of living in a big city at a reasonable price.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  Research Activities  My research project has focused on examining the role of an enzyme called protein arginine methyltransferase 5 in pancreatic and colon cancers. We found this enzyme to be extremely important in the context of these cancers. Furthermore, we identified a promising compound with anti-cancer properties through high throughput drug screening, with the ultimate goal of developing effective therapeutic strategies to combat these deadly diseases. My graduate work has resulted in 11 peer-reviewed publications and a patent. For this, I am thankful to my mentor, Dr. Tao Lu and the Graduate School for providing excellent mentoring and professional development opportunities.  Other Activities  I am passionate about volunteering. IUPUI and Indy have provided several opportunities in organizations on-campus as well as in the local community for me to do so, including: "

Museums and national parks in and around Indianapolis are great for weekend visits.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  As an international student from India coming directly for PhD after undergraduate studies, I didn’t get a chance to do campus visits and analyze the environment of the school. Thus, firstly, my virtual interactions with the amazing IBMG graduate program staff- Tara Hobson-Prater and Brandy Wood - helped me narrow down my options to IU School of Medicine (IUSM). Secondly, I knew I wanted to do research in a School of Medicine because that increases the possibility to work with clinical samples and do translational research. This helps to bridge the gap between research labs and clinics by employing the basic science research in the translation field. IUSM is circumscribed by different hospitals and many of their doctors have faculty appointment(s) in one or more IBMG programs. Thirdly, IUSM is right in the hub of industries, such as, Eli Lily, Covance, and Dow AgroSciences to name a few. Thus, IUSM provides numerous opportunities with respect to future job options that a graduating student might want to pursue from industry positions to clinical research titles. However, most importantly, IUSM provides some incredible and rare research focuses and the opportunity to get trained under some renowned scientists. For example, Dr. Haitao Guo’s (my mentor) lab is one of the only 15 labs in United States working on Hepatitis B virus.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  In terms of academic accomplishments, there has been a couple of such moments. The first one is definitely my successful transition to Candidacy and becoming a PhD. Candidate officially. The second one was the opportunity to give an oral talk on my project on an international platform at International Hepatitis B Virus Meeting, Seoul, South Korea. Thirdly, recently I was included as an author in a paper that I helped my mentor with revision experiments and was published in Plos Pathogens.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Indianapolis is the perfectly sized city for a graduate student to live lavishly with the ideal expense of living. One can find anything and everything here if they know how and where to look for it. There are music, art and food festivals occurring here all the year round. Last year I was able to attend Andrew Lloyd Webber’s “The phantom of the opera”. New restaurants pop up almost every season and considering the big foodie that I already am, I make a point to explore all the new ones. The canal adds to Indianapolis’ beauty and the walk by the canal on a summer evening is the most refreshing thing to do. Museums and national parks in and around Indianapolis are great for weekend visits. Indiana Comic Con is yet another big attraction that brings out my inner nerd.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  I am studying a particular Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) protein called p22 that has been known to exist for almost 20 years but has never been studied before. I am working towards characterizing this protein with respect to its biogenesis and its functions within the host. Our data show that the biogenesis of this protein is against the dogma and follows a very unique production route on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Almost 2.4 million people are chronically infected with HBV and 780,000 die every year because of the complications associated with HBV infection. Interferon alpha (IFN-α) is the only approved immunomodulatory medication for chronic hepatitis B patients but only 30% of these patients are responsive to this medication. Our results show that this protein can interact with HBV’s persistent genome, cccDNA and also inhibits host’s innate immune response leading to unsuccessful IFN-α response thus causing the chronic infection.  As a graduate student, research can be tough sometimes and hence, I like to do different activities whenever I get time to. I was a STEM Communication fellow at Science Central and volunteer with Science Central and other groups in inspiring kids to pursue STEM and become future scientists. Further, I am the Area 35 Director for Toastmasters and am involved with our very own IUSM Toastmasters club- Scientific Toasters @IUSM. I am involved with the IUSM networking committee that works towards hosting different networking events and provides opportunities for biomedical graduate students to get acquainted with various kinds of positions available in the present job market. I also serve as a student ambassador for international students joining IUPUI. I am associated with Association for Women in Science that is the largest multi-discipline organization for women in STEM. I am also involved with Bengali Association of India to keep my cultural side up and about with roles in theatres time to time. "

What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  Presenting at the 29th Congress of the International Society for Forensic Genetics (ISFG) has been a highlight academic accomplishment. The ISFG is one of the largest forensic genetics conferences, so I was honored to be accepted as one of the 60 oral presentations. It was exhilarating and terrifying to present to over 700 colleagues, but my presentation was shortlisted for best presentation, and I was awarded a travel fellowship to attend more conferences. This conference was a coveted learning experience and opportunity to network with other students and leading experts in the field.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  For me, it’s the people! Since moving here, everyone has been incredibly kind. There is always someone willing to help you out when you need it, join you on exploring the city, and to make sure you never feel alone  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  My research focuses on discovering the genetic background behind human facial shape.

Even though it is a big city, it has a small-town feel.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I was first exposed to nursing research as an undergraduate nursing honors student at IUPUI. I worked closely with a small cohort of students and a wonderful research faculty member, Dr. Rebecca Bartlett Ellis, to examine the behavior change techniques used in mobile health apps to support medication adherence. This experience ignited my passion for nursing research, particularly self-management research aimed at improving quality of life for people with chronic conditions and led me to pursue a PhD in Clinical Nursing Science. My research now focuses on self-management and symptom management in adolescents and young adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). I have been so fortunate to continue my studies by learning from world-renowned nurse researchers in a supportive yet rigorous academic environment.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  Being selected for the Elite 50 Award and Premier 10 Award from the IUPUI Graduate School was an unexpected blessing. I feel honored to have been recognized for such a prestigious award.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Indy is a vibrant city filled with great food, diversity, and lots of interesting museums. Even though it is a big city, it has a small-town feel.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  I have been actively involved at the IU School of Nursing (IUSON) as a PhD student. I am a T32 predoctoral fellow on the grant, Advanced Training in Self-Management Interventions for Serious Chronic Conditions , which has enabled me to gain a variety of research training and experiences with my mentor, Dr. Susan Rawl. I have been involved in research aimed at examining the cancer prevention and screening behaviors of Latinos living in Indiana. Being bilingual, I have greatly enjoyed working as part of an expert interdisciplinary team on this research study. I have also served as a nurse navigator for Dr. Rawl’s Approaches to Colon Testing (ACT) study. Providing patient education and navigation for patients considering colorectal cancer screening was an unforgettable experience that allowed me to learn hands-on about nursing intervention research. Additionally, I have worked closely with Dr. Wendy Miller on her research studying the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on nursing. We analyzed social media (Twitter) data to examine the public’s view of nursing during the pandemic and have also conducted qualitative interviews with nurses who have worked in the emergency department and intensive care units during the pandemic. I am grateful to be part of such timely and important research as a PhD student. I am also proud to serve as a student representative on the IUSON PhD Curriculum and Student Affairs committee. I have learned so much about academia and nursing research during my time at the IUSON. "

In my experience, people in Indianapolis are genuinely supportive and ready to collaborate.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  Since 2012 I have been living and working as an artist in Indianapolis. Much of my work leverages the benefits of art-making as a way to serve and engage community. I saw this commitment to community reflected in in the mission and vision of IUPUI. Choosing graduate school at IUPUI allowed me to deepen my engagement through the richness of graduate research. For this reason, IUPUI was the obvious choice.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  My favorite accomplishment has been translating my visual art practice into a qualitative research design that looks to use traditional candy-making techniques with diabetic patients and their physicians. This study will facilitate discussion of patients’ social and emotional experiences and look for perceived improvements in understanding. I’ve always been interested in the direct application of visual art in social situations. Before my MFA, I accomplished this through teaching or working in community. Designing this study has allowed me to achieve a more rigorous connection between art and its application in the social world.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  I love all the people I’ve been able to work with over the years. In my experience, people in Indianapolis are genuinely supportive and ready to collaborate. I enjoy opening my studio to visitors on First Fridays at the Circle City Industrial Complex and participating in community-based projects like Indy East Art Peace. The size of Indianapolis makes living and working especially meaningful. It’s large enough to feel like a big city yet small enough to really see the impacts of hard work, collaboration, and innovation.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  In my work as a graduate student I have applied art-making techniques to various community-based projects including: House Life Project, Homeless Voices, the Community Innovation Lab, and Indy East Art Peace. For Homeless Voices I partnered with the Coalition for Homelessness Intervention and Prevention to provide 7 zine-making workshops with 58 individuals experiencing homelessness. Participants created zines as a way to share their own experience with others through a subsequent art show and community conversation.  With the House Life Project, I created Told/Retold, a site-specific installation in an abandoned home located in St. Clair Place neighborhood. In this work, screws and metal leaf mark existing cracks, nails and holes in the walls. String connects each screw, symbolizing the narratives we create about a place. Told/Retold was designed to activate conversation about the concepts of equity, housing and race by revealing the differences between insider and outsider narratives. At a culminating community conversation, I co-designed and facilitated discussion around the question, what does it means to be a good neighbor? Attendees mapped their individual ideal neighborhoods then worked in small groups to create a sculptural representation of how each vision fit together.  My studio art practice involves working with sugar to create time-based installations that speak to the repetition and uncertainty typical for those living with chronic illness. I am interested in the contrast between repetitive, predictable cycles like testing blood sugar or taking insulin and the infinite unpredictability of the physical experience of illness and medical treatment in the body. From this practice I have designed a qualitative research study to consider how sugar-pulling techniques can be used as a metaphor for living with diabetes. This study will facilitate discussion between patients and their physicians and look for changes in understanding between parties. "

The reasonable cost of living allows one to live either in the city or the suburbs comfortably.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I work at IUPUI full-time and it was convenient (and cost efficient) to attend.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  My biggest academic accomplishment has been the acceptance of my book chapter, “A Critical Race Counter-narrative of an Adolescent African-American Father: Influences of Educational Motivation and Ways of Knowing” for the book, “I Am What I Become – Constructing an Identity as a Lifelong Learner”. The book is currently undergoing revisions and is set to be released late 2018 to early 2019.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Although I lived in other areas of the Midwest after graduating from college and graduate school, I was born and raised in Indianapolis. I have a very strong allegiance to the people and it is a very clean city. The reasonable cost of living allows one to live either in the city or the suburbs comfortably. You can’t beat that!  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  My current research interests includes the identity development and ways of knowing of African-American adult black males. I also have a strong interest in community work, particularly in how men of color approach the engagement of their communities. In addition to serving as the Director of Workforce Readiness and Program Development in IUPUI’s Office of Community Engagement, I am also the University’s primary representative for community building for the Near Westside neighborhood of Indianapolis. This responsibility includes supporting the work of the four neighborhoods that make up the Near West side (Haughville, Hawthorne, Stringtown and We Care), advocating for their rights and helping them to build capacity as they seek to build on the strengths of their neighborhood. It is the hardest, but most rewarding work I have ever done. "

I enjoy the world class restaurants, big-name concerts all year long, sporting events, local coffee shops, and the art and culture scene – Mass Ave, Fountain Square, and first Fridays. But most of all, I enjoy the walkability of downtown and the friendliness of the people.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI? After graduating from DePauw University, I entered Corporate America but knew I’d return back to the university setting to obtain a graduate degree – I just needed time in the “real world” to determine what path that would be. I worked in marketing and communications for three years, and then choose to attend IUPUI, because it had a Master’s program in Applied Communication from the School of Liberal Arts. I wanted a program that could challenge my skills as well as grow new ones. While in the program, I found my passion for health communication. As an undergraduate, I was on track to attend medical school until I decided that was not the career I wanted. So, in a way, the program at IUPUI brought my love of health and communication together. After graduating with my Masters in Applied Communication, I continued on in the PhD Health Communication program.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  I am most proud of being named a finalist (top three) for the National Communication Association, Health Communication Division “Thesis of the Year” award. I wrote my thesis on communication effectiveness in interprofessional healthcare teams, and it was great to be recognized by reviewers for its significance.

Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  As a graduate student, I am a research assistant for the Communication Studies faculty. I work on a wide range of projects, which allows me to explore areas of the discipline that I have not been exposed to yet. My research projects and interests have focused on how communication is used in interprofessional healthcare teams, specifically family medicine. I am passionate about giving back to the IUPUI campus and volunteering around Indy. Some activities I’m involved in are: "

When I was considering which law school to attend, I knew that my future career as an attorney would center on practicing in the Indianapolis area. The Robert H. McKinney School of Law is 100% plugged into the local legal community and offers great connections to practicing attorneys.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  When I was considering which law school to attend, I knew that my future career as an attorney would center on practicing in the Indianapolis area. The Robert H. McKinney School of Law is 100% plugged into the local legal community and offers great connections to practicing attorneys. Additionally, the flexibility of the part-time program offered me the ability to craft a curriculum that sets me up for success while continuing to work full time.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  This past spring, I was a part of the IU McKinney Wrongful Conviction Clinic with Professor Fran Watson. During the semester, our small team was able to work real cases for two people in Indiana who are incarcerated and fighting for post-conviction relief. We uncovered promising new facts and insights for their cases that could lead to their eventual exoneration and release.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  The Indianapolis area offers a great balance of size and small-town feel. I also appreciate the ways diversity and inclusion are becoming a stronger focus for the community. There are also so many hidden treasures in the surrounding neighborhoods and communities to enjoy local foods, beers, and spirits.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  My decision to attend law school has both professional and personal aspects. In my career, I have worked in a legal setting for many years and I am currently the Chief of Staff for my company’s Chief Legal Officer. We are a $2B company in 17 countries with over 100,000 employees, so…yes…we have legal issues every day! By achieving my law degree from IU McKinney, I will be able to shift my career from “playing” lawyer to actually being a lawyer.  In my service life, I volunteer on a prison ministry team with Kairos Prison Ministry International. We are a non-denominational Christian organization that works with men, women, and youths to support their ability to build meaningful relationships, founded in faith, both while they are incarcerated and after their release into the community. During my time with Kairos over the past seven years, I’ve seen firsthand the often-disheartening challenges of receiving good legal support to address innocence, post-conviction relief, sentence modification, or just navigating the criminal justice and corrections system.  Once I pass the Indiana Bar Exam next year, I plan to work pro bono with the incarcerated and their families to support their needs for equal access to justice. My biggest inspiration in this area is Bryan Stevenson and his book “Just Mercy.” His work in death row inmate advocacy and the equal protection issues surrounding the death penalty is fundamentally important to delivering justice. I am excited about using my law degree from IU McKinney in this way as well after I graduate. "

Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I was born and raised in Indiana, so I grew up hearing about Indiana University and Purdue University from friends and family all the time. This made choosing IUPUI an easy decision for me. As soon as I found out about the PhD program in Health Policy and Management, I knew I wanted to come here.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  I had the opportunity to collaborate with my mentor, Dr. Valerie Yeager, on a first-authored manuscript examining community engagement in Community Health Needs Assessments conducted by nonprofit hospitals. Our work was accepted for a podium presentation at AcademyHealth, the premier national conference in health services research. I was also awarded a Travel Fellowship to attend the conference, which was held in Washington, DC.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  I love living in Indy. There are so many places to visit and lots of local restaurants to try. One of the unique things about Indy is that you can live in a location where you have quick access to all of the businesses downtown, while also being within a relatively short driving distance of places to connect with nature, like Eagle Creek Park.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  My research focuses on public health systems and behavioral health services. I’ve had opportunities to collaborate closely with several faculty members in my department on a variety of different research projects. One of my favorite things about the projects I work on is that many of them involve community partners. I get to spend a lot of time engaging with local organizations in the community and helping them evaluate public health initiatives, which makes my work feel very meaningful. I also serve as the President of the AcademyHealth Student Chapter, which offers students interested in health services or health policy research opportunities for networking and professional development.

Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I had been considering a few different programs at IUPUI but ultimately ended up applying to the HPM program sort of last minute. I landed in this great department with supportive faculty and peers and really interesting research. I am very grateful to the faculty members that accepted me into the program as somewhat of a non-traditional applicant. This department has been a great fit for me and the connections the department and school have to the network of other health sciences and services researchers, organizations, and resources have created a lot of unique opportunities for me as a student.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  During the summer after my first year, Dr. Mazurenko and Dr. Menachemi brought me into a systematic review that they were conducting with a few others outside of the department. The review focused on studies of the effects of the Affordable Care Act’s optional Medicaid expansion. A significant part of the review included identifying and comparing findings by the level of rigor of the included studies which built off of a research design course I was taking at the time with Dr. Menachemi. The review was a phenomenal learning experience and we were able to publish what hopefully will continue to be an impactful paper. Being a part of the project helped me to really dive into the Medicaid literature and identify gaps in the literature that are now guiding my dissertation.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Indy has been a great city to live in during grad school. It is a manageable size with great restaurants and many unique areas of the city. Not only is Indy a great city with plenty to do, but it is only a few hours from so many other great cities that make great weekend trips!  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  Throughout the program I’ve been lucky to work with several different faculty members on a variety of different topics including public health systems and services, opioids, and an intervention for nursing homes. Currently, I’m spending much of my time on my dissertation which explores Medicaid administrative costs over time. Additionally, I’ve had the opportunity to TA several courses in our department and have been a part of the AcademyHealth Student Chapter here on campus. "

I get to work with different research groups with different backgrounds which has given me a unique research experience.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I think choosing a graduate school was one of the most important decisions in my life, especially as an international student who is studying far away from home. I chose graduate school at IUPUI as it is one of the top international world ranking universities. I wanted to work with distinguished professors in electrical engineering on the research topics that fulfill my own professional goals. I think IUPUI is unique especially when it comes to research diversity and a collaborative environment. I get to work with different research groups with different backgrounds which has given me a unique research experience.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  Publishing our research work at IUPUI in the top flagship conferences, the IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS) 2023. This is the world premiere forum in circuits and systems, so we were competing with others from all over the world and from industry and academia. Our work at IUPUI in the paper entitled “Employment of Graphene Nanomaterial in Optimizing Thermal Responses in IGBT Devices” got accepted for publication. The percentage of acceptance was less than 20% of the submitted papers from all over the world.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Indianapolis feels like home for me. I enjoy walking on campus and downtown area, and the facilities are impressive, especially the IU Natatorium and library. Living downtown is an amazing experience - everything is close by and within walking distance.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  My current research interests focus on power electronics, isolated DC-DC power supplies especially resonant LLC converters, electric machines, and high-power density devices. I have been an instructor for the electric circuit theory course, and I am involved in multiple projects funded by industry and the US. government. "

Urban Educational Leadership  I selected IUPUI for this degree program, because I wanted to continue my journey as a school leader, specifically focusing on issues related to Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility. I also know that IUPUI professors would give me individualized attention, and I knew there were opportunities for women on our campus.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I selected IUPUI for this degree program, because I wanted to continue my journey as a school leader, specifically focusing on issues related to Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility. I also know that IUPUI professors would give me individualized attention, and I knew there were opportunities for women on our campus.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  Participating in the 3MP research competition has by far been my greatest, formal accomplishment. My research is about the ways in which care is expressed by bilingual public libraries in United States Border Towns. I am especially grateful for Drs. Scribner and Nguyen (School of Education) for mentoring me while I’ve been taking classes and thinking about this particular research project. Without them, this experience and award would not have been possible.  I think my greatest academic accomplishment has been pursuing a master’s degree during the pandemic. I am a tenacious student, and I’ve had to give a lot of grace to myself while I balance my studies, full-time work, and being a mama to an active four-year-old. Graduate students who are balancing the emotional and physical challenges of this era are developing/enriching important soft skills like adaptability, flexibility, balance, and open-mindedness.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  I’ve been completing an educational leadership internship under Christopher Finley in Bloomington, Indiana. This semester, I designed a parent survey for the school’s International Baccalaureate self-study, which examines parents’ perspectives about inquiry-based teaching, student agency, and school culture. I’ve also been providing my leadership team with scholarship about what is behind student resistance. Many people see resistance in the classroom or schoolhouse through dominant culture lenses, and there is a perspective and depth of action that is often misunderstood and missed.  I am also an educational volunteer for the Afghan women who are currently living at Camp Atterbury. My Grandpa Frye originally came to Indiana for his Korean War Army training at Atterbury, so it’s especially meaningful for me to return to the land with a spirit of peace, focused on community-building.

My favorite places in Indy include the Indianapolis Museum of Art, Crown Hill Cemetery, the canal, and the beautiful IUPUI campus.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I discovered my current program in the International Health Economics Association’s newsletter and followed the link provided to check the program’s website. The website is concise, yet comprehensive. I read professors’ profiles and thought the program would be the perfect place for me to study economics. Through my years of study in the program, I have been advised, mentored, and taught by many respectable professors. Their serious attitudes towards academia, their liberal minds about civil life, and their caring for students’ achievements have deeply influenced me.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  Since I started my graduate study at IUPUI, I have published five peer-reviewed papers with professors at IUPUI and IU and have several other papers in process. I truly appreciate my co-authors and collaborators for including me in their projects and being willing to join me in developing my research ideas into papers. They have given me a lot of guidance and encouragement, which helped me establish strong interests in research and self-confidence in pursuing a research career.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Indy is a beautiful and vibrant city. My favorite places in Indy include the Indianapolis Museum of Art, Crown Hill Cemetery, the canal, and the beautiful IUPUI campus. Many artists live in Indy. I have joined several art walk activities and have really enjoyed talking with artists about their work. I also love my martial arts school, where I have met the grandmaster, and many brothers and sisters. I have been a tutor to a class of high school students and a teacher to an undergraduate class at IUPUI. All of the progress my students have made means very much to me. I am also grateful for all the kind people I have met both on and off campus in Indy. Quite often they provide unconditional help and support to me during my cloudy days, and quite often they push me towards my goals when I feel too tired to continue. I will never forget their kindness and will pay them back by helping others who are in need and who want to succeed.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  I have a wide-range of research interests, which include long-term care, health policy evaluation, cost-effectiveness analysis, injury prevention, and substance abuse. The first three research interests are a continuation from my previous research experience, but have been strengthened and enriched during my study at IUPUI. I have been working on my informal care project and have presented it at different academic conferences; I coauthored a paper studying cost-benefit of home blood pressure monitoring during my graduate assistantship at the School of Public Health; and have worked as an intern on cost-effectiveness analysis related research and tasks at RAND and Tufts Medical Center. The latter two research interests were developed at IUPUI. I met a great friend-and-mentor at IUPUI who specializes in injury prevention. Her passion for injury prevention influences me. We discussed injury prevention research a lot and exchanged thoughts on our research ideas. Our communication has generated several injury prevention papers. I took my minor classes at IU Bloomington and had the opportunity to get to know many professors there. During one class I took at IUB, my professor suggested I consider marijuana legalization for my class project. Later, I was asked to work with two other IUB professors on another research project on marijuana.  During my first year at IUPUI, I attended many student activities held by IUPUI International Club and Advancing Women Mentoring Program. These activities exposed me to different cultures and great people. They strengthened my belief that people’s greatness is not correlated with their race, ethnicity, nationality, or socio-economic status. Therefore never let prejudice be your barrier to become someone great. Open your eyes and heart to find the great minds around you, and let yourself be surrounded by the right people. "

I have already begun applying many of the learnings from Strategy in the workplace on projects I lead, with immediate returns on investment and high levels of success.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  I am originally from Atlanta. Although my family remains there and the city will always be home, the traffic is horrendous. Indianapolis, though it has numerous well-known businesses, does not present the same traffic difficulties. There are also endless social activities here and it is very affordable. Ultimately, I believe Indianapolis uniquely affords me all the amenities of city life without the traffic challenges.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  While studying at the downtown campus, I continue to work full time as an Improvement Engineer at the Indianapolis Business Center for Corteva AgriscienceTM, the Agriculture Division of DowDuPontTM. I also volunteer on two global steering teams, the Science Ambassadors, and the African American Network. In these networks, I use my time to give back to the communities where I live and work, whether it is applying for grants and leading projects for local organizations to increase their reach or mentoring local students for their future success. Most recently, I received the Eugene M. DeLoatch Legacy Award at the 2018 Black Engineer of the Year STEM Conference in Washington, D.C. It was a tremendous honor to receive this award from Dr. Eugene DeLoatch himself, the founding Dean of the School of Engineering at Morgan State University and first African American President of the American Society of Engineering Education.

Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  Research details My research involves making retinal ganglion cells from induced pluripotent stem cells. Retinal ganglion cells serve as the primary connection from the eye to the brain. When these cells die, that connection is lost, leading to blinding disorders such as glaucoma. I am interested in learning how these retinal ganglion cells develop so that we might better understand how to repair them when they degenerate.  Other activities Beyond my research, I enjoy sharing my love of science with others. I work with Central Indiana Science Outreach (CINSO) at the Indiana State Museum to organize an event called Taste of Science. The idea is to make science accessible to everyone. Our goal is to gather local researchers together with the community to discuss science.  I also work with undergraduates in the lab through programs like Project SEED and Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) to oversee promising students as they help with experiments and work on projects in the lab.  I am a mentor with Starfish Initiative, which pairs a college educated mentor with an academically gifted, economically disadvantaged high school student for up to 4 years. We do a variety of activities together including visiting local museums, performing basic science experiments, and job shadowing. It’s exciting to watch my scholar grow up and help her along the path to college. "

It has both a big city and small city feel, with the quietness in the day and some vibrant elements at night.   #### Alumna  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  In 2013, I met an entrepreneur, Bill Warren, who travelled to Beijing, China to launch a press conference for his project. I was serving as an interpreter for Bill and his group during their 5-day visit. After his visit, I became extremely interested in business, though my undergraduate degree is Broadcasting Journalism. Bill is from Indiana and graduated from Indiana University. He immediately recommended Kelley School of Business to me. Besides that, Bill and his wife, Susan, became my host family since I came to the U.S., inviting me to their house every single holiday. I am just in LOVE with the people in Indiana. So when it came time to choose my graduate school, Kelley School of Business (IUPUI) is the only school to which I applied, and thankfully, I was accepted.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  My favorite academic accomplishment is that I received the Kenda Beery Scholarship from the Master of Accounting program in September this year. It was such an honor to be the first recipient of this scholarship. I am also deeply humbled to be elected as the incoming President for our Graduate Accounting Student Board (GASB). I enjoy helping students to advance in their school and career, and giving back to the local community as much as we can. Lastly, I went through the Kelley Career Service and received a full-time job offer from Ernst & Young (EY) a few months ago. I would not have achieved these without Kelley.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  I love Indianapolis. It has both a big city and small city feel, with the quietness in the day and some vibrant elements at night. I am from Shanghai, the largest city in China with over 24 million people. I am very used to living in an urban city with the convenience of getting around using public transportation. Moving to Indianapolis is quite a big change for me. However, with the help of my host family and many other friends from church and school, I quickly settled down and enjoy driving around with very little traffic. I also enjoy walking and running by the canal in the afternoon when the sun is out. It is so peaceful and relaxing.

At the time of my acceptance to IUPUI I was single parent, social entrepreneur, and a full-time local pastor of an AME Church here in Indianapolis.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  It may seem cliché or trite, but as a Methodist clergywoman, the scripture in John 15:16 comes to mind as I considered this question. The scripture in part says, “You did not choose me, but I chose you. And I appointed you to go and bear fruit, fruit that will last...” I’d have to say that I don’t feel as if I chose the graduate school at IUPUI, but rather, the graduate school at IUPUI chose me. At the time of my acceptance to IUPUI I was single parent, social entrepreneur, and a full-time local pastor of an AME Church here in Indianapolis. Although I had always wanted to pursue a terminal degree in Philosophy, it seemed out of reach for me with my responsibilities as a parent, a professional and a pastor. When I saw the advertisement on a local listserv to have coffee with Dr. Ray Haberski to learn more about the American Studies PhD program, and I learned about the innovative approach to doctoral studies that the American Studies Program offered, along with the financial aid available for full-time students, not to mention being able to work with Dr. Joseph Tucker Edmonds, and it all seemed like it was kismet. I feel very blessed to be part of this program.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  Winning the 3MT Competition feels like a great academic accomplishment, but I suppose my favorite accomplishment since I have been here would be having two articles published in peer reviewed journals in one academic year. In addition to the publications, being selected as one of the IUPUI Elite 50 last year and successfully completing Qualifying Exams have been highlights.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Indianapolis is a wonderful place to raise a family. The cost of living is low, especially compared to the Washington, DC Metropolitan area, where our family is originally from. Additionally, I have found that there is a bourgeoning or renaissance of culture that enlivens me and makes me proud to be a Hoosier by choice.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  Throughout the week, I work at the IUPUI Arts and Humanities Institute as the Graduate Assistant for the Religion, Spirituality, and the Arts (RSA) Seminar. Through that project, I support Dr. Jason M. Kelly, as we sojourn with local artists, religious practitioners, and other diverse conversation partners as they explore, analyze, and imagine correlations between religious texts and their respective expertise. This has been a remarkably enriching synthesis between my vocational calling as pastor and my academic training as a scholar of religion and culture in the Americas. Additionally, due to the influence and mentorship of my minor advisor, Dr. Jamie Levine Daniel, the O’Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs has enabled me to produce some community engaged scholarship for which I am extraordinarily proud. Most recently, a central aspect of my dissertation project, a community film festival, was selected to be part of the Spirit & Place Festival. The Common Grounds Cinematic Conversations: The Enduring Legacy of the Plantation, was a day long film festival I developed that was underwritten by a grant from the Indiana Campus Compact and included community and university partners such as the O’Neill School, along with the IUPUI Arts & Humanities Institute, the IUPUI Center for African Studies and Culture, Good to the SOUL, and Crossroads AME Church. I am humbled and excited to represent the university at the Midwestern Association of Graduate Schools Annual Conference in Milwaukee, Wisconsin this upcoming spring. "

There’s something always going on, but there’s also space to breathe and relax. I moved here from Texas, so the weather here is also a plus.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  In the MLIS program, there are so many different avenues to go down when picking how you want your career to go in the Library/Information Science field. I like the huge variety of classes, and opportunities, like internships, for people who may not have had as much library experience during undergrad.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  My favorite accomplishment has been to earn a 4.0 GPA my first semester in grad school despite a lot of obstacles I faced. I realized during that semester that I was in a program that was not right for me. With that realization I was able to move to the MLIS program to start the upcoming semester. On top of being in the wrong program, the pandemic hit and classes were thrown into chaos as everyone scrambled to adjust to online learning. In spite of it all, I still earned a 4.0 GPA.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  I really like living in a city that doesn’t feel like a city. There’s something always going on, but there’s also space to breathe and relax.

Right now I am deciding between Academic Librarianship or Archives Management. "

Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I chose to come here because of the high caliber of training in the clinical psychology doctoral program. I also wanted to work with Dr. Catherine Mosher in her behavioral oncology laboratory, and train under several experts in cancer-related cognitive impairment.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  I am most proud of being awarded an F31 pre-doctoral fellowship from the National Cancer Institute to support my dissertation.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Close proximity to nature (e.g., Eagle Creek Park)  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  Broadly, my research is on behavioral symptom management for cancer survivors. More specifically, I am interested in management of cancer-related cognitive impairment through increasing physical activity. However, the cognitive problems faced by cancer survivors might interfere with their ability to organize themselves to be active. Engaging in regular physical activity is difficult enough for people without cancer and cognitive problems, so you can imagine how difficult it might be to remember and motivate yourself to be active if you had these problems as well. Therefore, my dissertation is focused on examining the effect of lowered executive functioning (i.e., higher-order cognitive functioning) on physical activity in older cancer survivors. If I can show that lower executive functioning interferes with older cancer survivors’ physical activity, then my future research could focus on developing ways to help survivors with cognitive problems become and remain physically active.

The IU School of Social Work and the Indiana Department of Child Services have a partnership that helps ensure best practices in child safety.

In addition to these professional experiences, I have enjoyed my practicum experiences facilitating grief groups with grieving children at Brooke’s Place and now searching for ways to increase retention in high stress working environments, such as DCS, and improving outcomes in the juvenile probation population through a study of best practice in placement and services and working within the dual status case type.

You don’t meet nicer people anywhere else.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I went to IUPUI for my undergraduate, because I lived close-by. When I was considering graduate school, I didn’t think twice to go anywhere else. I loved the PETM program and the professors.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  The two biggest accomplishments through IUPUI was the jobs that I was offered and graduating with my Bachelors degree in Tourism, Conventions and Event Management in 2015.  Through the graduate school in PETM, I was offered two amazing jobs; the first was an events intern for the Bicentennial Torch Relay. I assisted in the planning of the event and then spent 37 days driving to all 92 counties in Indiana. Secondly, I am currently working as the events intern at Downtown Indy. I am working on the smaller-scale events that happen on the canal, Monument Circle and Georgia Street.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  The longer I am here, the more I realize how much Indianapolis has to offer. Indy is a perfect mix of a metropolitan downtown with small-town values. You don’t meet nicer people anywhere else. I am also learning that even though Indy can seem large to some people, the business and event world is small. This makes even the big industries feel connected, as though we are all one big Indy family.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  I worked for a summer and semester with the Office of Indiana Tourism on the Bicentennial Torch Relay. This was my first experience working with events. With a Tourism and Events Bachelors degree, I loved working with them first-hand. Now, with Downtown Indy, I am able to fully understand what a conventional event looks like. I feel that these jobs have been what I have spent the past 7 years studying for. The other activity that I engage in at IUPUI is assisting professors with lectures. I come in as a guest speaker around three times a semester to lecture about the Disney College Program. "

Various activities such as Top Golf, camping, and state parks are a good break from work life.  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I was most attracted to the diversity in the Biology department with different areas of ongoing research. I had an opportunity to rotate in three different amazing labs working in three different research fields such as Vision Biology, Inner ear Biology and Cancer Research. I was happy to be accepted as a graduate student in the lab of Dr. Jason Meyer who works on using stem cells for the derivation of retinal organoids for studying neurodegenerative disorders leading to blindness.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  My favorite accomplishment is when I was the recipient of the “Linda and Jack Gill Symposium Image Award”, open to students and faculty which is presented at the annual meeting from among four different campuses of Indiana University. I least expected it and I am fortunate to be a part of the Meyer lab where we get to take super cool images from our stem cells. I received a plaque for the award followed by award money. Also, the coolest part about this award is that my image will be printed on t-shirts for the symposium next year and I cannot wait.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  I enjoy the diversity and mixed culture in Indianapolis. I love the bike and run trails in and around campus. Various activities such as Top Golf, camping, and state parks are a good break from work life. Living close to campus I have many opportunities to participate in various events organized by student organizations such as Desijags, Bridges International, Xiphos Corps, and the Student Activities Programming Board (SAPB), which help me meet new people, know about their cultures and participate in various fun and recreational activities.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  My research involves working with stem cells to derive cells of the retina and study their interplay with other cell types present in the neurovascular unit. My major research focus lies in understanding the factors that lead to retinal degeneration in blinding disorders such as glaucoma. With my efforts, I wish to delve deeper in unraveling the underlying mechanisms that lead to vision loss, which can be an important step forward in vision research. Awards:  Community involvement: "

In working with Dr. Monica Medina and her secondary education students and hearing about the critical, cutting-edge nature of the then-new doctoral program in Urban Education Studies, I knew IUPUI was where I needed to be.   ### Ph.D. in Curriculum and Instruction (Mathematics Education) at IUB  What degree are you working toward?  Ph.D. in Urban Education Studies at IUPUI Ph.D. in Curriculum and Instruction (Mathematics Education) at IUB  Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I had the pleasure of working with some of the amazing IUPUI School of Education faculty in my former position as a secondary mathematics teacher in Indianapolis Public Schools. In working with Dr. Monica Medina and her secondary education students and hearing about the critical, cutting-edge nature of the then-new doctoral program in Urban Education Studies, I knew IUPUI was where I needed to be.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  I was fortunate to receive the 2018-2019 Indiana University network-wide Wells Graduate Fellowship. In addition, I recently had a conference proposal, which focuses on the complementary nature of race consciousness and mathematical learning, accepted to one of the largest mathematics education research conferences. I’m excited on a personal level that my work was accepted and my efforts recognized through the fellowship, but I’m even more excited to be part of a larger conversation on the need to focus on racial equity issues in ALL domains, including ones more traditionally thought of as “race neutral.” None of this would have been possible without the critical feedback and support from the faculty at the IUPUI School of Education. If you haven’t visited the School of Education, you should. They are making powerful structural changes, which in my opinion, could be a model forward for other schools and universities.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  I always describe Indianapolis as a big city with a small town feel, and this is one of the many things I enjoy about Indy.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  I’d like to first thank the tremendous faculty and leadership within the School of Education, and particularly Dr. Erik Tillema, Dr. Crystal Morton, Dr. Craig Willey, and Dr. Dionne Cross. I’d also like to thank the many dedicated students within the Urban Education Studies doctoral program. Without this support network of critical scholars, my work would not be possible.  With that said, my work attempts to bring together different research domains more traditionally isolated from one another: mathematical learning and racial equity issues. Specifically, my work uses a design experiment methodology to investigate how secondary students’ development of race consciousness can support their mathematical learning, and how their mathematical learning can support their development of race consciousness. My research is situated at the confluence of four major calls within mathematics education: 1) work at the intersection of mathematical learning and race; 2) work using novel approaches for studying students’ understanding of quadratic relationships; 3) work examining students’ abilities to assess social information involving probabilistic processes; and 4) work supporting white teachers in navigating issues of race in mathematics. In addition, my research attempts to answer calls within mathematics education for collective professional collaboration toward equity by providing one example of how using work from traditionally different research “camps” (i.e., learning/cognition and equity) can strengthen inquiries, leading to better research as well as better teaching and learning experiences and outcomes, particularly for historically marginatized youth.  In my time as a graduate student, I have also been published in multiple peer-reviewed research journals, and have presented in nine different states and even Germany, including presentations at major national and international research conferences hosted by the American Education Research Association (AERA), the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM), The International Group of Psychology of Mathematics Education North American Chapter (PME-NA), TODOS: Mathematics for All, and the International Congress of Mathematics Education (ICME). I also serve as a mentor and advocate for secondary students and mathematics teachers locally; am a lead organizer for a regional conference focused on mentoring math education graduate students (Indiana Mathematics Education Research Symposium); serve as a board member on the state-wide organization Hoosier Association of Mathematics Teacher Educators (HAMTE); and served on the Psychology of Mathematics Education North American Chapter (PME-NA) local organizing committee to host the PME-NA 2017 conference in Indianapolis.

Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I visited IUPUI in spring 2018 as a part of the Getting You Into IUPUI program. As a result, I was able to secure a summer internship at the IUPUI School of Science. During my internship, I had a fantastic experience both inside and outside of the laboratory. I was also able to speak to some faculty at the School of Medicine during that time, and they were extremely welcoming and keen to support my ambitions. I also made lifelong friendships on campus and could picture myself on IUPUI campus for the upcoming five years. After learning about the diverse state-of-the-art research ongoing at IUPUI, and the number of resources available to help graduate students succeed, I decided to come back to IUPUI for my graduate studies.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  It has to be passing my PhD qualifying examination. Starting the second year of my PhD during a pandemic was daunting as it set me way behind in terms of research progress. So, I had my fears of not knowing enough and not having enough data at different points leading up to my exam. On the other hand, I enjoyed the process of questioning from my committee because it made me think about my research, and science in general, in a way that I haven’t. After passing the exam, I was able to identify my gaps in knowledge and build upon the information I have to help move my research forward. I am currently working on my first author research article, and it has been an exciting journey to make scientific discoveries with my lab group, and I look forward to sharing it with the world.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  I love the big, yet small, city ambiance of Indianapolis. Every single person I have met so far is friendly and always willing to help. There is also a community for everyone as the city is quite diverse. During my leisure, I enjoy cycling at the canal, playing tennis, and going on hikes and dinner dates with my husband.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.

As I worked as a researcher collaborating with scholars from diverse areas in Korea, I learned about the importance of having scientifically rigorous and integrative knowledge for social work scholars to advocate and help the underserved population. Additionally, it is pivotal to solve complicated social issues through our research. After becoming aware of the Indiana University School of Social Work (IUSSW) graduate program, which was highly ranked in U.S. News, I found that IUSSW Ph.D. program allows doctoral students to have interdisciplinary research experiences. Therefore, the course design and academic culture of this program perfectly met my desire. In this program, while minoring in economics, I could learn from and work with many valuable professors and colleagues not only in social work but also in different disciplines including philosophy, sociology, labor study, SPEA, nursing, medicine, and computing and informatics. Benefits of the University Fellowship, as well as grant opportunities in IUSSW, were also crucial factors for choosing this School. Thanks to the University Fellowship, I could focus on and enjoy my doctorate journey with little financial pressure. Generous travel grants from IUSSW doctoral program have helped me actively distribute my research findings at the national conferences as well.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  My most favorite and recent accomplishment is being awarded the Social Work HEALS Doctoral Fellow this year, funded by the National Association of Social Workers Foundation (NASW) and the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE). This fellowship is one of the most remarkable and competitive awards in the social work area that supports selected doctoral students to accomplish their doctoral dissertation. Other academic achievements in this program are also meaningful. Based on my diverse research experience in multidisciplinary fields, I have published seven research articles in peer-reviewed journals, two manuscripts are under review, eleven studies were presented at the national professional conferences since I joined this program, and three are scheduled in 2018.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Indianapolis, a state capital and growing city, is very well-planned and clean. I cannot forget my first time seeing the amazingly bright sky in this city right after I arrived at the Indy Airport. This city is calm enough to live and study in, but also provides many fun events. When I have free time, I especially like walking along the canal, having time at local coffee shops or restaurants, and enjoying music performed by the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra (ISO) at Hilbert Circle Theatre.

My work and ideas around creative problem solving in education policy, education leadership, and education reform have been accepted by Design-Ed, the Indiana Urban Schools Association, International Conference on Urban Education, the Design Management Institute, the Academy for Educational Studies, and the Journal of Curriculum Theory. My research is focused on policy implementation in urban school communities—how individuals interact around and through policy; further, how interactions converge and impact neighbors, educators, parents/caregivers, and students. Specifically, I explore the ecologies (Weaver-Hightower, 2008) between city and school with particular concentrations in three areas: 1) how marginalized students and groups of students are represented and framed by dominant narratives (Harry, Rueda, & Kalyanpur, 1999) in policy implementation, 2) community stakeholders’ learning via transformative professional learning (Macey & Radd, 2013) towards equity, and 3) critical collaborative problem solving. My first research concentration centers the inquiry of how social, historic, and economic factors of cities and neighborhoods shape the ways in which federal, state, and local policies are enacted. My second research concentration focuses on community stakeholders’ learning for equity, particularly centering the socio-historic and socio-economic legacies surfaced in my initial concentration. I am interested in how all members of a community can access spaces and opportunities of learning and leading for equity that assist in: 1) critical self-reflection and 2) authentic approaches and interactions of collaboration. Finally, my third research concentration is focused on how people and groups of people can move collaboratively, while possessing a critical lens, in partnerships with organizations and institutions toward redressing inequitable practices in policy creation and implementation (Sutton & Levinson, 2001; Kozleski & Thorius, 2013).

    "body": " One of the last steps to obtaining your doctoral degree is to defend your  dissertation. Defense processes vary depending on whether your degree is conferred through IU or Purdue.   ### Purdue Defense Requirements  The details for defending a thesis or dissertation for a Purdue graduate program at IUPUI can be found here, in the Purdue Graduate Student pages of our website.  Select information on Exams and the Deposit Process.   ### IU Defense Requirements   ## Schedule Your Defense  Once your research committee has read a final draft of your dissertation and agrees that it is ready to be defended, provide each member of your committee with a full, unbound copy of the dissertation and arrange a mutually agreeable time and place for your defense.  You should allow at least four weeks between the time you give the committee members their copies and the date of the defense so that they will have sufficient time to read and critique your work. The four-week waiting period will also allow other faculty members who might be interested in your work to plan to attend your defense as well.   ## Announce Your Defense  Forty days prior to your scheduled defense, submit to the IU Graduate School Indianapolis via the PhD Defense Announcement Submission eDoc.  [PhD Defense Announcement Submission eDoc.](https://apps.iu.edu/kr-prd/kew/EDocLite?userAction=initiate&edlName=UGS-PhDDefense.ParentDoctype)  The announcement must include:  The eDoc will route to your department and the chairperson of your research committee for approval.  Once announced, the time and place cannot be changed without the approval of the dean of the IU Graduate School Indianapolis.   ## At Your Defense  Have your acceptance page and abstract available to be signed. The committee should not sign the acceptance page and abstract until their post-defense revisions are completed and approved..  In case your committee should insist on extensive revisions before giving its full approval, your dissertation chairperson will probably hold on to the acceptance page and abstract until you fulfill the committee’s recommendations.  Students are rarely required to go through a second oral examination.  If you know in advance that any member of your committee will be absent, you should, with the approval of the dean, arrange to have another faculty member sit on the committee. Occasionally an absent committee member can participate by telephone or video link. "

Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  I was encouraged by my mentors at IUPUI to continue my education at the graduate level. I felt comfortable working with them because they had offered so much support during my undergraduate years. Also, IUPUI offered me several scholarships that made it possible to continue my education.  What’s been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  I had the opportunity to go on a Study Abroad trip to Greece to make a documentary. As a graduate student and service learning assistant, I played an intrigal role in planning and executing the trip. We made a documentary, Despotiko: An Unknown Treasure (see the complete video list below), about an active archeological site. The documentary was widely accepted and even selected for viewing at a film festival. It was an amazing experience.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  I love the liveliness of living in downtown Indianapolis. I had never lived in an urban city prior to going to IUPUI, and it is amazing. I have friends and colleagues who also live downtown and we can meet in 10 minutes. There is so much to do. I feel like I am in the center of it all.  Videos:  [Despotiko: An Unknown Treasure](https://vimeo.com/134105970)  This video tells the story of a relatively unknown, but significant, archeological site named Despotiko and the incredible ancient history surrounding it. It also looks at the recent efforts to understand the site and reconstruct parts of it to its original dimensions.

Why did you choose graduate school at IUPUI?  Because it is one of the best universities in the world located in the 301-400 number in the Shanghai ranking 2019, one of the most trustable rankings of best universities.  What has been your favorite academic accomplishment since you’ve been here?  As an international student and English as a foreign language student, my biggest accomplishment is to have succeeded with the challenges that graduate studies involve, especially after having taken classes completely online from my home country during my first year of studies due to the current pandemic.  What do you enjoy most about life in Indianapolis?  Indianapolis has given me the opportunity to meet wonderful people, beautiful parks, and places to enjoy with my family. I came here as a Fulbright grantee and traveled with my dependents. Everything in Indianapolis is a new experience for us, and we very much appreciate the kindness of people that have helped us settle down to have a nice experience in the U.S.  Please provide some details about your work/research as a graduate student and/or any activities you are involved in.  As a Fulbright grantee, I am currently writing my thesis about self-regulation in language learning. With this project, my aim is to address one of the issues of the “reto-foco pais” in Colombia, my home country. The “reto-foco pais” my study focuses on is “society”, which encompasses a sub-focus called “education”. The purpose is to delve more into the construct of self-regulation in language learning and determine language teaching practices that can help English instructors promote self-regulated learning behaviors in Colombia to help learners succeed not only as language learners but more importantly, as lifelong learners.
