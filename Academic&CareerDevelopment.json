You are not required to know the answer to every aspect of your life right this moment. Instead, embrace the challenges, the mistakes, and the unknowns. Every time you overcome an obstacle, you become more empowered.  Biography : I am originally from northern Indiana and have lived most of my life in Indiana. Much of my joy goes to being surrounded by family and friends. I believe being surrounded by the people you love simply feeds the soul. Some of my hobbies include baking, reading, surfing Pinterest for the newest dinner recipe, and snuggling two cats at a time (because one just isn't enough)! "

Graduates of the philanthropy major lead nonprofit and philanthropic organizations using their skills in fundraising, grant making, foundation leadership, social impact, and much more. Our graduates are leaders in the public, private, and nonprofit sectors. The IU Lilly Family School of Philanthropy is the first school in the world to offer a Bachelor of Arts in Philanthropic Studies (Lilly Family School of Philanthropy, 2019).  Skills and abilities this major develops: fundraising, strategic planning, and management.   ### Engaged learning experiences  Regardless of your major or future career, engaged learning is vital to your present and future.

    "body": "  ## Anthropology   ### School of Liberal Arts  The Department of Anthropology focuses on training students to apply anthropological insight to nonacademic settings. This means our graduates become practicing anthropologists in diverse settings such as hospitals, state and federal agencies, zoos, museums, archaeological contracting firms, and almost any context in which an understanding of human culture is essential. Many of our students acquire graduate degrees and have been admitted to some of the most competitive graduate programs in the country.   #### Degree map  One of the most difficult tasks of being a college student is figuring out what classes to take and when to take them. In order to make the process a little easier, each major at IUPUI has its own degree map outlining the path you should take to graduate as quickly as possible.

you’ve selected your first semester classes from the planning guide, you’ll need to add them to iGPS (Interactive Graduation Planning System). The video below shows you how to do this.  Completing this step allows your student success advisor to review your classes prior to your appointment and be prepared with their approval or have recommendations to consider before registering for your first semester at IUPUI. This also allows more time during your appointment to discuss any questions you have.  Watch the video below to learn how to add your classes to your shopping cart using iGPS.  Want a guide to all of those class notes mentioned in the video and what they mean? Check out the FAQ section at the bottom of this page!

All new freshmen at IUPUI take a first-year seminar (FYS) course that introduces them to student life, college expectations, the campus, and their majors.  Most students start their first-year seminar during Bridge Week, which is a weeklong program that takes place the week before the beginning of the fall semester to help prepare students for their first year of college. During Bridge Week, students make new friends, get a jumpstart on learning about their majors, and start connecting to campus activities and resources. You might even get started on some of your fall course work!  If you have concerns or questions about starting your first-year seminar during Bridge Week, let your student success advisor know when you meet.   #### In course search, what do the notes under the class mean?   #### What if I already have college credit?

    "body": "  ## The STAR Program  STAR (Students Taking Academic Responsibility) is an academic success program for University College students on first-time probation or first-time reinstatement after a previous dismissal.  The program provides volunteer professional staff, student mentors, and academic coaches from across campus who guide and support STAR students by helping them set realistic and attainable academic and personal goals, recommend campus resources, and address other needs or concerns as they arise.  STAR students meet with their coach or mentor 4-5 times a semester for 30 minute sessions. Ideally, you will meet once in September, twice in October, once in November, and once in December. As noted in the academic probation policy and the reinstatement contract for University College students, participation in STAR or another program such as the Diversity Enrichment and Achievement Program (DEAP), 21st Century Scholars Success Program, or Student Support Services (SSS) is mandatory.  My first reaction was one of defiance, but then I thought, ‘it can’t hurt.’ I had little idea how much it would come to help me. I don’t have many friends on campus, and with my mentor, I realized I had someone at school I could communicate with and help keep me committed to my goals.   ### Resources for STAR students  [Weekly commitment form](https://indiana.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/msteams_92d57a/ESioGvb1Kp1EuDWv7xAvDzoBG0ZDTsTMSniSyNu8imJmtg?e=gZ2Qm4)  Weekly commitment form  [Grade check form](https://indiana.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/msteams_92d57a/EcrX2y_jITxDuv71KKgXkYEBxLuewdUWhMthHC4kG9pJ9w?e=SXsjcN)  Grade check form  [Bepko Learning Center's student resources](https://blc.iupui.edu/student-resources/index.html)  Bepko Learning Center's student resources  [Video resources](https://iu.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bp8lYowd2KZzSYt)  Video resources "

About 20,000 openings for EMTs and paramedics are projected each year, on average, over the decade. Many of those openings are expected to result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force, such as retirement ( Occupational Outlook Handbook , 2022).   #### Salary information  According to the IUPUI First Destination Survey in 2020, the average starting salary reported for School of Medicine graduates with a bachelor's degree was $57,035, and the median salary was $56,673.  The national median annual salary for EMTs and paramedics was $36,930 in 2021 ( Occupational Outlook Handbook ).  (This section is intended for informational purposes, not prediction of actual salary.)   #### Graduate and professional school paths  Those pursuing the Associate of Science in Paramedic Science degree at IUPUI often complete bachelor’s degrees in the following areas:  Once a bachelor’s degree is complete, students with paramedic science backgrounds might pursue advanced degrees in the following areas:   ### Quick facts   #### Sample coursework   #### Possible careers  *These careers require additional education or training.   #### Where could I work?   ### Complementing interests  S Social  I Investigative  R Realistic  [Get your interest code](https://acd.iupui.edu/explore/choose-your-major/connect-majors-to-careers/interests/index.html?)   ### Where to get more information  [IU School of Medicine](https://medicine.iu.edu/undergraduate-health-professions/degrees/associate-paramedic-science)  IU School of Medicine  [Indianapolis EMS](https://indyems.org/)  Indianapolis EMS  [Health and Life Sciences Advising Center Hine Hall, IP 241](https://hls.iupui.edu)   #### Health and Life Sciences Advising Center  Hine Hall, IP 241   ### Health and Life Sciences Cluster  This major belongs to the Health and Life Sciences (HLS) cluster.

    "body": "  ## Majors and careers for conventional interests   ### For data and real people  Majors and careers can be clustered into six broad interest areas that correspond to six different personality types. Based on the research of Dr. John Holland, this clustering system provides a preliminary way to identify undergraduate majors and careers that might be a satisfying fit for you. Because personality, majors, and careers are too complex to be described by a single interest theme, you will see that the lists below have a three-letter code to more accurately describe majors and careers using a combination of related interests (in order of importance). This “conventional” page reflects the interest cluster that ranks the “C” theme first, but be sure to review the other five clusters to see if any of those themes (A, I, S, R, E) are more descriptive of your interests.   ### Am I conventional?  Check off your interests, values, abilities, and qualities to find out.  These are characteristics of the conventional type. Conventional people are practical, well controlled, sociable, conservative, prefer structured tasks, and prefer conformity. They like to work with data, have clerical or numerical ability, and are very attentive to detail. If this sounds like you, read on. If not, try one of the other five interest clusters.   ### Conventional majors  The following is a small sample of majors a conventional person might find interesting.  [Accounting](https://indiana.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/msteams_92d57a/ETutECKU_RBLjC0Eiy77UcsBzsEROyl4KeI-y4ZvVgNWaQ?e=LTZj91)  [Health Services Management](https://indiana.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/msteams_92d57a/ETpxjTiH2-NMmm6A9TICVm4B2a0GnFiUy7U7RPaG5oXKng?e=VumcjQ)  [Cytotechnology](https://indiana.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/msteams_92d57a/EQOBR95ZCk5KkFuZekNxPSIBaELF_nkRnxCoRX3DZEYwzg?e=op7YIM)  [Human Resource Management](https://indiana.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/msteams_92d57a/EfEz7zpSgk9Fk8ArNj8RtzkBSM4sY5XiGleYoDQxOzWVgg?e=MnMTN9)  [Finance](https://indiana.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/msteams_92d57a/EZqzLx9xO0hJmPckyxtN1q0BrEXuYDtkiIm7mY38km9GZA?e=LxXIks)  [Social Work](https://indiana.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/msteams_92d57a/EdHZmnla28JAtaW2kTq_KOgBbfoJjKg9K-m3sys8DcJmww?e=4QxKob)  [Forensic and Investigative Science](https://indiana.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/msteams_92d57a/EaEi2qBpaPxFlDIsv1K_OtcBrR7L1uWbp2r75uNRAqd7fA?e=5UZnZa)  [Tourism](https://indiana.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/msteams_92d57a/Ee2m-zDqTRVKvP0NNPd5aCYBMdg_NhzYaeTaZ5qT_7OCFQ?e=uEGUoK)  [Health Information Administration](https://indiana.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/msteams_92d57a/EbyBwT_wnlhKgSZsiBOy42YBEy0u_ev0lfjw9qzXcBzurA?e=e1M7JS)   ### Conventional careers  Following is a small sample of careers a conventional person might choose.   ### Selecting a conventional major and career  Selecting a major and career is a very involved process, requiring careful evaluation of yourself as well as academic and occupational information. No single questionnaire, assessment, or person can tell you what you should pursue. In order to make the best choices, it is important to consider your unique combination of interests, values, abilities, personality, and experiences.  Keep in mind that majors and careers can accommodate a wide range of interests; an exact fit is not necessary for academic and career satisfaction. The majors and careers above are suggested only as starting points for your exploration. Specific major and career decisions can be discussed in more detail with your academic advisor or career counselor.   ### More information on careers and advising  [Schools, majors, and degrees offered at IUPUI](http://www.iupui.edu/academic/schoolsdepts.htm)  Schools, majors, and degrees offered at IUPUI  Check sheets for each IUPUI major  [Course descriptions for IUPUI](https://bulletins.iu.edu/iupui/)  Course descriptions for IUPUI  What can I do with a major I choose?

Get to know some of the Academic and Career Development (ACD) staff that are first-gen, too!   ### Dee Alderman  Career Consultant, STEM  What advice do you have for other first-gen students? Balance your schedule so you're not taking all of the classes that challenge you at one time. Also make sure you utilize the resources available to you on campus! Who, or what, was your greatest support that helped you transition to college? The offices and support mechanisms on campus. I was also a member of TRIO Student Support Services, and they were a great resource as well. I would tell a first-generation student to get involved both with academic supports and with student life. There is so much available on campus to help you be successful!

It is 110% okay to ask questions—even the ones you think \"should\" be obvious; our obvious is different than others, and that's okay. You're already taking a huge step in being the first, and it's okay to not have all the answers. Who, or what, was your greatest support that helped you transition to college? Finding my people. I was introduced to my best friend by happenstance through friends I made in my FYS, and we were inseparable. I truly don't know that I would have made it without her cheering me on and being there to help me—her dad was an alum of our school, so she had a lot of the answers to questions I had. What was your fondest memory of college? I have so many, but if I had to pick one, it'd be a finals tradition my best friend and I had: a Taco Bell 12-pack snuck into the library to munch on the entire day while we studied and did projects. We'd stay in that freezing library for 12 hours and trudge across campus at 2 a.m. to crash in bed!  What advice do you have for other first-gen students?

Ask ALL the questions. This transition into something new can feel very overwhelming, and there are going to be things that you encounter that you never even thought to ask about before. Don't ever hesitate to reach out to your advisor or a professor if you need some extra guidance. That's what they're here for! Who, or what, was your greatest support that helped you transition to college? My husband. I received some well-meaning, but admittedly bad advice, when I first transitioned from high school to college. I had no one I could really turn to for help at that time. When I returned to school as an adult learner, my husband really helped walk me through what I needed to do, and it made all the difference. What was your fondest memory of college? Finally finding a major that really fit who I was and what I was passionate about. Once I discovered this, so many other pieces started to fall into place!

Treat everything as a learning opportunity. Things might not go as planned or might be more difficult that you were prepared for, but you could really learn something from those experiences. Who, or what, was your greatest support that helped you transition to college? My roommate and my advisor. As someone who was really shy, my outgoing roommate taught me to just ask questions and figure it out. Don't know the lingo? Ask someone what that abbreviation or acronym means. Don't know how to get to that class? Leave 10 minutes earlier than you would have and figure it out. My advisor was more gentle and encouraging—he taught me how to understand degree plans, communicate with my instructors, and make the most out of the \"extras\" in college, like internships, colloquial classes, and picking minors. What was your fondest memory of college? I don't know that I could pick just one. I think what I look back at most fondly from college are the times I spent with friends I still have today. Sure, I learned a lot and college is what prepared me for what I do now, but none of that would mean much if I hadn't met all of the amazing people I did!

Join study groups when possible. It's amazing how much more you can learn by discussing homework or prepping for tests with your peers. I remember my first few months as a freshman. I thought I was one of the only ones who didn't understand some of the concepts in my intro to sociology course. So rather than embarrass myself by raising my hand, I kept quiet. I later found out when I joined a study group that no one else understood the same things I didn't! We worked on those problems together and did well on the next few tests. Don't be shy about asking your instructors, your advisor, and even some of the students in your classes for help when you need assistance. Who, or what, was your greatest support that helped you transition to college? I was a year behind my best friend in high school. He went to college before I did. When he came home for the holidays, he encouraged me to apply to the same school. We were both musicians and wanted to continue playing in our band, so I ended up where he was. It was much easier for me to make friends when I knew one already. We hung around the same people, and the band was playing more and more, so the beginning of my college experience was based on a gut feeling that I should go where my friend was. That's probably not the best way to choose a school, but for me it worked. What was your fondest memory of college? This will sound a bit strange, but my fondest memory was getting academically dismissed from my college. What that allowed me to do was to take a break from the rigors of academia and took a couple of semesters off to play in the band, work full time, and come to the realization that I was not going to be a rock star and that I'd better get my degree first. So after I was mentally ready to tackle college again, I picked the major that felt the best for me (teaching), buckled down, and graduated. The second fondest memory? Going back to school to get a master's degree. Those decisions ultimately led me on a long and winding path to IUPUI and becoming one of the directors in our office.

You'll develop your own unique perspective of justice, freedom, and equality.  The major allows students to think critically about the function of race within individuals, institutions, and society while gaining an awareness of social justice issues. For this major, you'll choose a concentration in one of three areas: Africa, Caribbean and Latin America, or North America.  Skill and abilities this major develops : cultural competency, writing, public speaking, critical thinking, research, and teamwork (IU School of Liberal Arts, 2017).  Print page   ### Engaged learning experiences  Regardless of your major or future career, engaged learning is vital to your present and future. It makes you more marketable for jobs and professional schools upon graduation, it enables you to build deeper connections with faculty and staff in your field of study, and it makes your learning personal by connecting your interests and values with the curriculum from your classes.

Employment of postsecondary teachers is projected to grow 12% from 2021 to 2031, much faster than the average for all occupations. About 132,600 openings for postsecondary teachers are projected each year, on average, over the decade.

    "body": "  ## Sociology   ### School of Liberal Arts  Human beings are social animals. We live in groups and do most things with other people. Much of what we think, say, and do is influenced by what others expect of us and by how others treat us. Sociologists study the patterns of interaction between people in all sorts of settings—at work, at play, at home, etc. They try to clarify what is going on, what lies behind it, what is likely to come from it, and what might be done differently. Their theories and research findings can provide insights into processes and events that affect our everyday lives.  Perhaps you have wondered why some families get along fine while others seem mired in problems, why some people get involved in criminal careers while others resist temptations, why some companies are much more productive than others, or why some governmental programs succeed while others backfire. These are the kinds of issues sociologists look into in systematic ways.   #### Degree map  One of the most difficult tasks of being a college student is figuring out what classes to take and when to take them.

    "body": "  ## Physics   ### School of Science  All physics majors study the foundations of the field: classical mechanics, classical electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, relativity, and statistical physics. They also learn a great deal of mathematics (more than is required for a minor) and have a year of chemistry. Depending on individual career goals, physics majors may also take additional courses in chemistry and biology, electrical or mechanical engineering, or physics and mathematics.   #### Degree map  One of the most difficult tasks of being a college student is figuring out what classes to take and when to take them. In order to make the process a little easier, each major at IUPUI has its own degree map outlining the path you should take to graduate as quickly as possible.

Work or involvement experience while at IUPUI: Lead volunteer at Paws Pantry.  Advice to students: You will find what you love! I was so nervous coming into college, thinking that I had made the wrong decision about my major and that I wouldn't be able to change it. Things happen and interests change, but you will find your passion! It might take your first couple of semesters, but if you are nervous about where you are, don't be. Everything will work out, and there are a ton of resources that will help you find your passion.  Brief bio : I am from Greenwood, Indiana, and I love volunteering, spending time with my friends and family, and going for walks to clear my mind. After graduating from IUPUI, I hope to work in a small health care clinic as a manager. "

    "body": "  ## Learn more about our successful students  There are more than 19,000 undergraduate students at IUPUI, each with a unique background and experience. Hearing other students’ stories and their strategies for success can help in navigating and making the most of your college career. Highlighted below are a few of the many successful IUPUI students.   ### December 2019—Birdie Ratliff  This month we're celebrating a former exploratory major and University College student, Birdie Ratliff!   ### Why Birdie chose to begin as exploratory  Birdie is a junior who started at IUPUI as an exploratory major. She wanted to attend IUPUI because it wasn't too far from family, but also not too close. Since she was unsure what she wanted to major in, the advisors at orientation recommended exploratory. This was right for her because she was able to explore different fields and majors to determine which major best suited her.   ### How Birdie discovered her major  Birdie took many different courses during her freshman and sophomore years before changing her major. She discovered what courses and fields she liked and disliked.  After frequent meetings with the University College exploratory advisors, Birdie discovered sustainable management and policy. She is very eco-friendly and cares about recycling and saving the planet, so she felt like this could be the perfect major. Some careers she’s considering include working for the U.S. National Parks Service or for city parks. She even has an internship with Keeping Indianapolis Beautiful where she will help with community gardens and tree plantings.   ### Birdie's strategies for success  Birdie’s main strategies for success are time management and prioritization. Planning out coursework and study time helps with accomplishing important assignments and tasks on time. She also attends study groups regularly for her courses. Hearing other people’s perspectives and learning processes can help with better understanding of content.   ### Birdie's advice for exploratory students  Birdie suggests meeting with the University College exploratory advisors frequently because they are very helpful with the exploration of majors and even with discovering majors you might not know exist.  A common misconception of starting as an exploratory major is that you won’t finish on time; however, Birdie didn’t change her major to sustainable management and policy until the end of her sophomore year and has the opportunity to graduate a semester early. Don’t be scared to explore majors if you’re not sure what you want to do yet. Birdie even said, “I don’t think I would have found my major if I didn’t do exploratory.”   ### October 2019—Chica Ketterman  In celebration of National Transfer Appreciation Week, October 21–25, we're celebrating transfer student and former University College student, Chica Ketterman!   ### Why Chica transferred to IUPUI  Chica is a sophomore who transferred to IUPUI in 2018 from Los Angeles Valley College, which is located in the San Fernando Valley, California. She also attended an art school in California before discovering her passion for science and engineering.  Chica moved to Shelbyville, Indiana, to work in the engineering field. Previously living in Indiana and having her mom living here helped make the transition less difficult. She came to IUPUI to earn a degree in mechanical engineering technology so she can continue her engineering career.   ### How Chica discovered her major  When Chica attended Los Angeles Valley College, she was majoring in physics. However, after taking some courses and exploring career options, she felt that physics was too broad of a major and couldn’t see herself finding a career that she would be passionate about.  When Chica moved to Indiana, she starting working in the engineering field and was able to visualize herself continuing this career. She came to IUPUI wanting to graduate with a mechanical engineering technology degree. Her long-term goal is to relocate to another state and work from home doing freelance engineering.   ### Chica's strategies for success  The biggest challenge Chica faced was working full time while taking classes full time. She admits that she is still working on her academic strategies, but that prioritization has been the most helpful. Chica's University College academic advisor, Rachael Carmichael, helped Chica work on her prioritization and time management skills. She also believes that having a good support system, like her mom and friends, is very important.   ### Chica's advice to new transfer students  A lot of the advice students hear is to get involved, but this can be very difficult for those who work full time. Chica’s advice for new IUPUI transfer students is “don’t be afraid to ask questions and network by making friends with motivated students and teachers.” "

Try something that you might not have thought about before coming to college!  If you could be any major in your cluster, what would it be? Why?: Probably sports management because it would be interesting to learn more about the business side of things you may not see beyond the score reports.  Biography : I was born and raised in the Indianapolis area and am a graduate of Warren Central High School. I like exploring the city and trying out new restaurants that are established. When not in the office, I am most likely to be at a local hockey game or doing something related to Disney! Some of my favorite things include spring, navy blue, board games, and reality tv. "

    "body": "  ## Majors and careers for artistic interests   ### For idea creators  Majors and careers can be clustered into six broad interest areas that correspond to six different personality types. Based on the research of Dr. John Holland, this clustering system provides a preliminary way to identify undergraduate majors and careers that might be a satisfying fit for you. Because personality, majors, and careers are too complex to be described by a single interest theme, you will see that the lists below have a three-letter code to more accurately describe majors and careers using a combination of related interests (in order of importance). This “artistic” page reflects the interest cluster that ranks the “A” theme first, but be sure to review the other five clusters to see if any of those themes (R, I, S, C, E) are more descriptive of your interests.   ### Am I artistic?  Check off your interests, values, abilities, and qualities to find out.  These are characteristics of the artistic type. Artistic people are creative, independent, expressive, imaginative, original, and intuitive. They like to compose, write, appreciate the arts, create, imagine, and generate new ideas. If this sounds like you, read on. If not, try one of the other five interest clusters.   ### Artistic majors  The following is a small sample of majors an artistic person might find interesting.

No single questionnaire, assessment, or person can tell you what you should pursue. In order to make the best choices, it is important to consider your unique combination of interests, values, abilities, personality, and experiences.  Keep in mind that majors and careers can accommodate a wide range of interests; an exact fit is not necessary for academic and career satisfaction. The majors and careers above are suggested only as starting points for your exploration. Specific major and career decisions can be discussed in more detail with your academic advisor or career counselor.   ### More information on careers and advising  [Schools, majors, and degrees offered at IUPUI](http://www.iupui.edu/academic/schoolsdepts.htm)  Schools, majors, and degrees offered at IUPUI  Check sheets for each IUPUI major  [Course descriptions for IUPUI](https://bulletins.iu.edu/iupui/)  Course descriptions for IUPUI  What can I do with a major I choose?

    "body": "  # Kinsey C Ashworth  Student Success Advisor, STEM Cluster  Education:  Professional Experience :  Advice to students: Ask a lot of questions. Take notes on meetings (outside of class!). Explore yourself and be willing to allow changes to your future plans. Don't compare yourself to your classmates/friends. Network in your classes—your classmates and professors are your future colleagues.  If you could be any major in your cluster, what would it be? Why ?: I would have loved to be a biomedical engineering major. Math has never clicked for me, but if it did, I would love to be an engineer in the medical field and create new products to help people.  Biography : I have lived in four different states (Indiana, Kansas, Florida, and South Carolina), but I grew up in Indianapolis, Indiana. I attended Franklin Central High School, but ended up moving to Hays, Kansas, for my final year of high school, so I am a Hays High School graduate. I use my degree in history to my advantage in trivia competitions. I have a ragdoll cat named after King Henry VIII. I am a proud aunt to my nieces and nephew, and you will see them all over my office. I am looking forward to serving IUPUI students! "

Why?: Environmental science. I love science and read a ton of nonfiction about environmental issues and the evolving knowledge base that informs the discipline.  Biography: I grew up in Evansville, Indiana, in the southwestern part of the state, went to college in northern Indiana, and now call Indy my home. When I’m not working, I’m spending as much time as possible outside. Hobbies I enjoy include woodworking, hiking, trail biking, kayaking, and copious amounts of reading. More than anything, I enjoy watching my kids grow into amazing people and traveling to new places. I have four chickens, who provide us many laughs and lots of eggs. My favorite place on campus is the Magnolia Courtyard between Taylor Hall and the Education Building. "

    "body": "  ## About the finance major  Finance majors help corporations sort out the complexities of their investment options and align them with their long-term goals. You'll learn how to create and to maintain wealth, as well as administer and manage money. You'll also study corporate finance, investments, and banking. Every business major will complete a broad base of general business courses. If you're interested in the real estate field, this major provides a track for specialization.  Skills and abilities this major develops : analysis, critical thinking, marketing, and communication.   ### Engaged learning experiences  Regardless of your major or future career, engaged learning is vital to your present and future. It makes you more marketable for jobs and professional schools upon graduation, it enables you to build deeper connections with faculty and staff in your field of study, and it makes your learning personal by connecting your interests and values with the curriculum from your classes. Check out the three ideas below for places to get started, or learn more at IUPUI’s Institute for Engaged Learning website.

Opportunities are also available through Kelley Bloomington’s study abroad program.   ### Opportunities after graduation   #### Career opportunities  Employment of financial managers is projected to grow 17% from 2021 to 2031, much faster than the average for all occupations. About 71,300 openings for financial managers are projected each year, on average, over the decade. Many of those openings are expected to result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force, such as retirement ( Occupational Outlook Handbook , 2022).   #### Salary information  According to the IUPUI First Destination Survey in 2021, the average starting salary reported for finance B.S.B. graduates was $58,211, and the median salary was $56,000.  The national mean starting salary for business graduates who majored in finance was $59,627 for the class of May 2020, according to the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE, 2022).  (This section is intended for informational purposes, not prediction of actual salary.)   #### Graduate and professional school paths  Finance majors often pursue advanced degrees in the following areas:   ### Quick facts   #### Sample coursework   #### Possible careers  *These careers require additional training or education.   #### Where could I work?   ### Complementing interests  I Investigative  E Enterprising  S Social   ### Where to get more information  [Kelley School of Business](https://kelley.iupui.edu/)  Kelley School of Business  [CFA Institute](https://www.cfainstitute.org/)  CFA Institute  [Kelley Indianapolis Career Services](https://kelley.iupui.edu/recruiters-companies/career-services/index.html)  Kelley Indianapolis Career Services   ### Enterprise, Policy, and Planning Cluster  This major is part of the Enterprise, Policy, and Planning (EPP) cluster.

Why?: Marketing with minors in psychology and neuroscience and a certificate in nutrition. I like to understand the mind/body connection and how nutrition can impact our mental and physical health. Then I'd use my marketing major to educate and share that message to better serve our community.  Quick facts about me: I’m from a small town in Carroll County, Indiana. I currently live in McCordsville with my husband, Craig. I've known for most of my life that I was going to work with students in some sort of capacity. I'm a third-generation educator. As you can see from my alma mater, my retention rate at IUPUI is 100%. I live for basketball season—grew up a Boilermaker fan and continue to bleed black and gold. #Boilerup I really enjoy cooking, fitness, and staying active. My current favorite workout is Reformer Pilates. I also love to travel and consider myself a foodie. "

    "body": "  # Maddy Saunders  Student Success Advisor, EXPLR Cluster  Education:  Professional Experience :  Advice to students: If you're curious about something, do it! Take a random class you find fascinating, participate in a study abroad program, or join a new organization. You'll learn to step out of your comfort zone, and you might find a new passion. Also, always ask as many questions as you can!  If you could be any major in your cluster, what would it be? Why?: Exploratory, because I love the freedom to be unsure about where you're headed, and the opportunity to try new things.  Biography : I grew up in Cincinnati, Ohio, and then hopscotched around the Midwest before settling in Indianapolis. Outside of IUPUI, you can find me exploring Indianapolis, reading a novel from my ridiculously long \"to be read\" list, or trying to convince myself that I like to cook. I also love to travel, and I'm a (self-proclaimed) expert in finding cheap flights. I've never met a puzzle I didn't like. "

    "body": "  ## About the ceramics major  Herron’s ceramics curriculum develops your understanding of the medium in the context of contemporary society and historical tradition. You'll gain skills in analysis of specific works of art that are developed through courses in art theory, art history, research methods, and the uses of materials and tools needed to create works of art. You'll also study specific periods, cultures, styles, and themes that exist in the field of art. The ceramics program is supported by lavish space and equipment in the heart of 16 Tech, an innovation community in Indianapolis.  Skills and abilities this major develops: understanding historical contexts, analysis, fine art skills, and cultural competency (Herron School of Art and Design, 2017).   ### Engaged learning experiences  Regardless of your major or future career, engaged learning is vital to your present and future. It makes you more marketable for jobs and professional schools upon graduation, it enables you to build deeper connections with faculty and staff in your field of study, and it makes your learning personal by connecting your interests and values with the curriculum from your classes.

Students are trained to be critical observers and informed, active participants. They are also prepared for a variety of careers—from politics to teaching, law, public administration, and business.   #### Degree map  One of the most difficult tasks of being a college student is figuring out what classes to take and when to take them. In order to make the process a little easier, each major at IUPUI has its own degree map outlining the path you should take to graduate as quickly as possible.

    "body": "  ## About the geography major  Geography is the study of spatial patterns and processes associated with phenomena in both the natural world and the world of human affairs. While studying this major, you'll learn about topics such as the spread of disease, the sprawl of cities, the distribution of plants and animals, and the diffusion of culture and ideas based on spatial components.  As a geographer, you'll learn methods of natural sciences, social sciences, and even the arts. You'll also learn about tools to understand the fundamentals of place, including maps, satellite images, interviews, and field work.  Studies and abilities this major develops : analytical skills, communication, critical thinking, writing, and research (IU School of Liberal Arts, 2018).   ### Engaged learning experiences  Regardless of your major or future career, engaged learning is vital to your present and future. It makes you more marketable for jobs and professional schools upon graduation, it enables you to build deeper connections with faculty and staff in your field of study, and it makes your learning personal by connecting your interests and values with the curriculum from your classes. Check out the three ideas below for places to get started, or learn more at IUPUI’s Institute for Engaged Learning website.

Despite limited employment growth, about 1,000 openings for cartographers and photogrammetrists are projected each year, on average, over the decade. Many of those openings are expected to result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force, such as retirement ( Occupational Outlook Handbook , 2022).   #### Salary information  According to the IUPUI First Destination Survey in 2021, the average starting salary reported for School of Liberal Art graduates was $44,206, and the median salary was $38,800 .  The national median annual salary for cartographers and photogrammetrists was $68,900 in 2021 ( Occupational Outlook Handbook ).

What do you enjoy, and what motivates you? How do you learn and work best? Say \"yes\" to experiences and opportunities that align with those things. Give yourself space to grow, change, and discover.  If you could be any major in your cluster, what would it be? Why?: Global health. During my undergrad, I took a few courses related to environmental ethics and public health. I loved learning about the ways our relationship to the environment impacts our health and imagining a healthier bigger picture.  Biography : I grew up in Huntington Beach, California, but have lived mostly in Indiana since starting college. I have been a runner since high school and am usually training toward some sort of new goal. I also love all things outdoors—hiking, camping, biking, and looking at trees and birds. I enjoy visiting friends and family, experiencing coffee, and hanging out with my adopted cat, Rocky. "

    "body": "  ## Majors and careers for social interests   ### For people helpers  Majors and careers can be clustered into six broad interest areas that correspond to six different personality types. Based on the research of Dr. John Holland, this clustering system provides a preliminary way to identify undergraduate majors and careers that might be a satisfying fit for you. Because personality, majors, and careers are too complex to be described by a single interest theme, you will see that the lists below have a three-letter code to more accurately describe majors and careers using a combination of related interests (in order of importance). This “social” page reflects the interest cluster that ranks the “S” theme first, but be sure to review the other five clusters to see if any of those themes (R, I, A, E, C) are more descriptive of your interests.   ### Am I social?  Check off your interests, values, abilities, and qualities to find out.  These are characteristics of the social type. Social people are community-service oriented, interested in educational activities, prefer social interaction, and are concerned with social and religious issues. They like to inform, enlighten, train, develop, and cure others. They may also be skilled with words. If this sounds like you, read on. If not, try one of the other five interest clusters.   ### Social majors  The following is a small sample of majors a social person might find interesting.

Definitions of the above job titles can be found at ONET Online . For additional social majors or careers, consult your academic advisor or a career counselor.  [ONET Online](https://www.onetonline.org/)   ### Selecting a social major and career  Selecting a major and career is a very involved process, requiring careful evaluation of yourself as well as academic and occupational information. No single questionnaire, assessment, or person can tell you what you should pursue. In order to make the best choices, it is important to consider your unique combination of interests, values, abilities, personality, and experiences.  Keep in mind that majors and careers can accommodate a wide range of interests; an exact fit is not necessary for academic and career satisfaction. The majors and careers above are suggested only as starting points for your exploration. Specific major and career decisions can be discussed in more detail with your academic advisor or career counselor.   ### More information on careers and advising  [Schools, majors, and degrees offered at IUPUI](https://www.iupui.edu/academics/degrees-majors/)  Schools, majors, and degrees offered at IUPUI  Check sheets for each IUPUI major  [Course descriptions for IUPUI](https://bulletins.iu.edu/iupui/)  Course descriptions for IUPUI  What can I do with a major I choose?

    "body": "  # Morris  Jones  Student Success Advisor/Team Coordinator, EPP Cluster  Education:  Professional Experience:  Advise to students:  “Hard work works. Working really hard is what successful people do. And in this text, tweet, world that you’ve grown up in, remember just because you’re doing a lot more doesn’t mean you’re getting a lot more done. Don’t confuse movement with progress.”  Denzel Washington: I had a 1.7 GPA. (Retrieved 3/25/19, https://www.goalcast.com/2017/08/15/denzel-washington-2).  If you could be any major in your cluster, what would it be? Why?: If I were to choose a major in the EPP cluster to pursue, I would choose philanthropy because it fits best with my worldview of helping others through nonprofit organizations.  Biography: I grew up in central Indiana and have lived most of my life in Indiana. My hobbies include working with wood, building things, and learning something new. To relax, I like science fiction movies (both good and bad) and watching shows like the Walking Dead , the History Channel, and the Discovery Channel. I have coached youth soccer and track. I am married and have two children and five grandchildren. My wife is a bookkeeper and a deputy clerk of the courts. My daughter is an assistant coordinator of the Sport Science Institute at the NCAA, and my son is a captain in the Army. "

    "body": "  ## About the music therapy major  The Bachelor of Science in Music Therapy is an approved program of the American Music Therapy Association that provides the musical, technical, and therapeutic skills to practice as entry-level music therapists in a variety of clinical fields. You'll engage in traditional academic music studies (e.g., music theory, aural skills, music history), piano, voice, guitar, percussion, improvisation, music technology, psychology, and specific music therapy courses.  Graduates of the program take the national certification examination administered by the Certification Board for Music Therapists (CBMT). After passing this exam, you'll be a board-certified music therapist (Purdue School of Engineering and Technology, 2019).  Skills and abilities this major develops: musical knowledge and ability, problem-solving and troubleshooting skills, active listening, and social perceptiveness skills.   ### Engaged learning experiences  Regardless of your major or future career, engaged learning is vital to your present and future. It makes you more marketable for jobs and professional schools upon graduation, it enables you to build deeper connections with faculty and staff in your field of study, and it makes your learning personal by connecting your interests and values with the curriculum from your classes. Check out the three ideas below for places to get started, or learn more at IUPUI’s Institute for Engaged Learning website.

About 1,500 openings for recreational therapists are projected each year, on average, over the decade. Many of those openings are expected to result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force, such as retirement ( Occupational Outlook Handbook , 2022).   #### Salary information  According to the IUPUI First Destination Survey in 2021, the average starting salary reported for the School of Engineering and Technology graduates with a bachelor's degree was $58,879, and the median salary was $60,000.  The national median annual salary for recreational therapists was $47,940 in 2021 ( Occupational Outlook Handbook ).  (This section is intended for informational purposes, not prediction of actual salary.)   #### Graduate and professional school paths  Some music therapy majors pursue graduate or professional school to work in areas such as clinical or counseling psychology, research, or medicine. Many others obtain graduate degrees in music therapy, school counseling, music theory, and music composition.   ### Quick facts   #### Sample coursework   #### Possible careers  *This careers require additional training or education.   #### Where could I work?   ### Complementing interests  S Social  A Artistic  I Investigative  [Get your interest code](https://acd.iupui.edu/explore/choose-your-major/connect-majors-to-careers/interests/index.html?)   ### Where to get more information  [Purdue School of Engineering and Technology](https://et.iupui.edu/)  Purdue School of Engineering and Technology  [American Music Therapy Association](https://www.musictherapy.org/)  American Music Therapy Association  [National Association of Schools of Music (NASM)](https://nasm.arts-accredit.org/)  National Association of Schools of Music (NASM)   ### Arts, Humanities, and Human Services Cluster  This major is part of the Arts, Humanities, and Human Services (AHHS) cluster.

    "body": "  ## About the electrical engineering technology major  An electrical engineering technology major will prepare you to solve problems related to generating, distributing, transmitting, and using electrical energy. You'll apply your knowledge to help design and develop computers, communications equipment, medical monitoring devices, navigational equipment, and other electrical and electronic equipment.  An engineering technology degree is different than engineering because the class and laboratory work is focused on applications. As you learn theories of how things work, you'll apply them in immediate, relevant ways.  Skills and abilities this major develops : logical thinking skills, mechanical skills, math skills (for analysis, design and troubleshooting), observational skills, and teamwork.   ### Engaged learning experiences  Regardless of your major or future career, engaged learning is vital to your present and future. It makes you more marketable for jobs and professional schools upon graduation, it enables you to build deeper connections with faculty and staff in your field of study, and it makes your learning personal by connecting your interests and values with the curriculum from your classes.

The blended, hands-on curriculum provides the flexibility to prepare you for leadership roles no matter where you are in your career. The program incorporates group dynamics, global leadership perspectives, theory, and practice. Many organizational leadership courses are offered in a variety of formats to accommodate busy students and professionals.  Skills and abilities the major develops: communication, leadership, human resource management, project management, analytical, and decision-making.   ### Engaged learning experiences  Regardless of your major or future career, engaged learning is vital to your present and future. It makes you more marketable for jobs and professional schools upon graduation, it enables you to build deeper connections with faculty and staff in your field of study, and it makes your learning personal by connecting your interests and values with the curriculum from your classes.

Skills and abilities the major develops: understanding historical contexts, analysis, fine arts skills, and cultural competency (Herron School of Art and Design, 2017).   ### Engaged learning experiences  Regardless of your major or future career, engaged learning is vital to your present and future. It makes you more marketable for jobs and professional schools upon graduation, it enables you to build deeper connections with faculty and staff in your field of study, and it makes your learning personal by connecting your interests and values with the curriculum from your classes.

Why is a college education important to you? Why is IUPUI important to you? When you identify those values, then set goals, seek experiences, and seize opportunities that will continue to drive that motivation.  If you could be any major in your cluster, what would it be? Why?: I would love to be an epidemiology major! I am a problem solver, so the idea of investigating the spread of disease and creating strategies to keep the public safe and healthy is fascinating to me.  Biography : I am originally from the Indianapolis area and have spent my entire life in Indiana. And while I love home, I also love to travel. Some of the more exciting places I have visited include Iceland; Banff National Park in Canada; and San Juan, Puerto Rico. I also love to hike and spend time outdoors when the weather is nice! When the weather isn’t nice, I read, work on puzzles, and watch lots of TV and movies. I now live in Fishers with my husband.

    "body": "  ## Discover yourself  Additional assessments are available to IUPUI students for a small fee. Learn about the benefits of the Strong Interest Inventory or the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) by talking with your career consultant. Just call (317) 274-4856, and we'll direct you through the process and help you interpret the results.  The Strong Interest Inventory is a self-assessment instrument that can be used to help you discover your interests. This information can be used to assist with educational and career decisions. The questionnaire asks about your preferences in regard to hobbies, occupations, personal characteristics, leisure activities, occupational activities, school subjects, and types of people. It takes 35–40 minutes to complete. A fee of $21 must be paid prior to taking the inventory.  Your results come in the form of a report, which you will discuss with a career consultant. Even though the report includes a list of occupations that might be suitable for you based on your answers, they may or may not be the best fit. You should always thoroughly explore any occupation you are considering.  The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator is a self-inventory designed to identify a person's personality type, strengths, and preferences. Developed by Isabel Myers and her mother Katherine Briggs, the MBTI is based on their work with Carl Jung's theory of personality types. By developing an indicator that could be used to help people understand individual differences, Myers and Briggs believed that they could help people select occupations that were best suited to their personality types.  [Carl Jung's](http://psychology.about.com/od/profilesofmajorthinkers/p/jungprofile.htm)  The goal of the MBTI is to help you further explore and understand your own personality, including likes, dislikes, strengths, weaknesses, possible career preferences, and compatibility with others. No one personality type is best or better than any other one. The goal is simply to help you learn more about yourself. Once you pay the $17 fee, you can complete the MBTI online. In a follow-up appointment, you will discuss the results with a career consultant. "

    "body": "  ## Discover your path  The process of choosing a major or deciding whether or not you should change your major can be overwhelming. The steps below will help you get started in deciding what to do. Contact your Academic and Career Development team if you would like help.  Step #1: Learn about yourself  If you want to be confident about your major and career decisions, start by looking at yourself. Determine what drives you, your interests, your strengths, and what you want out of life. You can know all about possible majors and explore lots of careers, but your research will be much more productive if you can identify what you need and want in a career first . Learning about yourself and what makes you tick makes the next steps much easier.  There are four dimensions of self that should guide your decisions: values, interests, personality, and skills (VIPS). Let's look more closely at your VIPS and how they impact your work and personal life.   #### VIPS  To make good, informed decisions about majors and careers, first look at your values, interests, personality, and skills.   #### Self-assessment  Your answers to the questions asked in each assessment below will help you identify your values, interests, personality traits, and skills.  Step #2: Create a targeted list of options  What are your interests? Consider the coursework you will be taking as part of the major. Will you enjoy the majority of the classes?  Some occupations prefer certain majors, coursework, or preparation. What major(s) will help you reach your professional goals? How can you develop the skills and qualities employers seek?  Use your answers to these questions to create a list of majors and careers to explore.  While some majors tend to connect to certain occupations, most majors lead to a variety of careers. Many major paths can lead to the same career destination.   #### Majors  Review a list of majors that IUPUI offers.  Step #3: Collect information  Major exploration is a critical step in your decision making. Unfortunately, many people make decisions about a major based on inadequate or inaccurate information. IUPUI has over 200 programs, so your strongest, most informed choices require current, realistic, and accurate information. What are the degree and admissions requirements? Resources on this site will answer many of your questions.  Standards and admission requirements vary widely by major. Review required courses and determine what’s necessary to be admitted to the specific program you're interested in. Once you have gathered this information, talk with people. Visit advisors in the schools, as well as faculty, upperclassmen, or even alumni with degrees from these programs. As you review information, if you have questions about choosing or changing a major, program requirements, or academic planning, just contact us. We want to help you succeed.   #### Degree requirements  Consider degree requirements when choosing your major.  Step #4: Connect majors to careers  Maybe you have majors in mind, but aren't sure how they connect to careers. With our major-career connections sheets, you will get an overview of each major along with career opportunities, employment options, and links to additional information.  [Interest code booklet](https://indiana.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/msteams_92d57a/ET0ZMGp8A3FPiGeG3i004iQBBUn1gMvOLGf6EJttVrmBug?e=SmCtX1)  Interest code booklet  Match your interests  Major-career connections sheets  More on majors and careers  If you have questions or need a resource above in an accessible format, please email Mike Slocum.  Step #5: Evaluate your options and create a plan  Now you’ve researched majors and identified which could best fit your unique situation. What’s next? Confirm your decisions with information from professionals and related experiences. When you’re ready, be sure to update your major. Make a plan to get hands-on knowledge and to gain skills.   #### Update your major  When you're ready, fill out this form to update your major.   #### Explore careers  Begin gaining experience and creating professional contacts.

About 3,800 openings for urban and regional planners are projected each year, on average, over the decade. Many of those openings are expected to result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force, such as retirement ( Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2022).   #### Salary information  According to the IUPUI First Destination Survey in 2021, the average starting salary reported for the O'Neill School of Public and Environment Affairs graduates with a bachelor's degree was $45,726, and the median was $45,500.  The national median annual salary for urban and regional planners was $78,500 in 2021 ( Occupational Outlook Handbook ).

    "body": "  ## Human resource management   ### Kelley School of Business  Human resource (HR) managers are the epitome of “people” people. Think of them as casting directors who help put the right people in the right job—and then develop the culture and compensation packages to keep them motivated. But the focus of HR is bigger than acquiring and managing talent.  While human resource managers do recruit, hire, train, and assess a company's talent—what many would call an organization’s true assets—their core role is to understand how to get people to be the best they can be and turn their performance into success for the organization. To that end, human resource managers play a strategic role, impacting decisions about organizational structure, change management, work design, and more.  When you enter the human resource management field, you may travel the traditional route of human resources and labor relations—such as compliance with employment and labor laws, management development, wage and salary administration, organizational planning, and contract negotiation—or you may choose to jump into the newer areas in the behavioral sciences, tracking their implications for human resource management programs.   #### Degree map  One of the most difficult tasks of being a college student is figuring out what classes to take and when to take them. In order to make the process a little easier, each major at IUPUI has its own degree map outlining the path you should take to graduate as quickly as possible.

    "body": "  ## About the anthropology major  Anthropology is the study of human behavior. This major encourages you to explore the origin and behavior of humans and their physical, social, and cultural development. Anthropologists study the way of life, remains, language, and physical characteristics of people around the world. They compare customs, values, and social patterns of different cultures, past and present. Archaeologists reconstruct a record of extinct cultures, especially preliterate ones, to determine age and cultural identity by classifying and interpreting artifacts, architectural features, and types of structures recovered by excavation (IU School of Liberal Arts, 2017).   ### Engaged learning experiences  Regardless of your major or future career, engaged learning is vital to your present and future. It makes you more marketable for jobs and professional schools upon graduation, it enables you to build deeper connections with faculty and staff in your field of study, and it makes your learning personal by connecting your interests and values with the curriculum from your classes. Check out the three ideas below for places to get started, or learn more at IUPUI’s Institute for Engaged Learning website.

Both shorter and longer immersion programs are also available.   ### Opportunities after graduation   #### Career opportunities  Employment of anthropologists and archeologists is projected to grow 6% from 2021 to 2031, about as fast as the average for all occupations. About 800 openings for anthropologists and archeologists are projected each year, on average, over the decade. Many of those openings are expected to result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force, such as retirement ( Occupational Outlook Handbook , 2022).   #### Salary information  According to the IUPUI First Destination Survey in 2021, the average starting salary reported for School of Liberal Arts graduates was $44,206, and the median salary was $38,800 .  The national median annual salary for anthropologists and archeologists was $61,910 in 2021 ( Occupational Outlook Handbook ).  (This section is intended for informational purposes, not prediction of actual salary.)   #### Graduate and professional school paths  Anthropology majors often pursue advanced degrees in the following areas:   ### Quick facts   #### Sample coursework   #### Possible careers  *These careers require additional training or education.   #### Where could I work?   ### Complementing interests  I Investigative  R Realistic  S Social   ### Where to get more information  [Department of Anthropology (CA 143)](https://liberalarts.iupui.edu/departments/anthropology/)   #### Department of Anthropology  (CA 143)  [Society for Applied Anthropology](https://www.appliedanthro.org/)  Society for Applied Anthropology  [Archaeological Institute of America](https://www.archaeological.org/)  Archaeological Institute of America   ### Arts, Humanities, and Human Services Cluster  This major is part of the Arts, Humanities, and Human Services (AHHS) cluster.

You do not have to start college knowing all of the answers, but keep challenging yourself to learn and to grow as you figure out your best next step.  If you could be any major in your cluster, what would it be? Why?: Neuroscience . I really loved both biology and psychology courses and learning throughout my schooling journey and beyond . I would like to combine those two interest areas to learn more about the nervous system, its functions, and how it influences our behavior and learning .  Biography : I grew up in Jasper, Indiana, but my family and I ha ve called Indianapolis home for many years . I have also lived and worked in Ohio and Arizona . My husband and I both work at universities , and we have elementary-aged children at home. I enjoy spending time with family and friends , reading, playing board games, running, swimming, and baking.

With a degree in applied computer science, you’ll be ready to design the future of medicine, business, engineering, and the arts. At IUPUI, applied computer science students investigate the ways fundamental theories can be translated into real-world applications.  This major focuses on building foundational skills in computing, while also developing soft skills to be leaders in the IT world. You'll take a course on project management and have an opportunity to build your leadership skills. While the Bachelor of Science in Computer and Information Science focuses on mathematics and theory, this major focuses on applying your learning in real time to be ready for industry.  Skills and abilities this major develops: technical proficiency, project management skills, communication expertise, and analytical skills.   ### Engaged learning experiences  Regardless of your major or future career, engaged learning is vital to your present and future.

    "body": "  ## About the public safety management major  If the process of protecting the public fascinates you, the public safety management major will give you a well-rounded understanding of public safety theory and the skills and services used to save lives.  As part of your coursework, you'll study a wide range of topics—administration of emergency services, principles of public safety, the art of decision making, terrorism, financial management, GIS techniques, public policy, and much more. You’ll learn from faculty who are studying criminal justice issues relevant to the field of public safety and who have real-world experience to match.  Skills and abilities this major develops: strategic planning, project management, communication, and leadership.  Print page   ### Engaged learning experiences  Regardless of your major or future career, engaged learning is vital to your present and future. It makes you more marketable for jobs and professional schools upon graduation, it enables you to build deeper connections with faculty and staff in your field of study, and it makes your learning personal by connecting your interests and values with the curriculum from your classes. Check out the three ideas below for places to get started, or learn more at IUPUI’s Institute for Engaged Learning website.

Despite limited employment growth, about 900 openings for emergency management directors are projected each year, on average, over the decade. Many of those openings are expected to result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force, such as retirement ( Occupational Outlook Handbook , 2022).   #### Salary information  According to the IUPUI First Destination Survey in 2021, the average starting salary reported for O'Neill graduates with a bachelor's degree was $45,726, and the median was $45,500.  The national median annual salary for emergency management directors was $76,730 in 2021 ( Occupational Outlook Handbook ).

    "body": "  ## About the nuclear medicine technology major  Nuclear medicine technologists provide care in diagnosing patients, imaging organs, and offering therapeutic services through ionizing radiation emanated from radioactive materials. These technologists are capable of performing quality control procedures on medical instruments and on radioactive materials. They also assist physicians in clinical procedures such as doing intravenous injections, drawing blood, assessing the technical quality of the studies, and providing basic patient care.  Skills and abilities this major develops: critical thinking and problem solving, use of technologies, knowledge of human anatomy and physiology, communication skills, and ability to be detail oriented.   ### Engaged learning experiences  Regardless of your major or future career, engaged learning is vital to your present and future. It makes you more marketable for jobs and professional schools upon graduation, it enables you to build deeper connections with faculty and staff in your field of study, and it makes your learning personal by connecting your interests and values with the curriculum from your classes. Check out the three ideas below for places to get started, or learn more at IUPUI’s Institute for Engaged Learning website.

Despite limited employment growth, about 1,000 openings for nuclear medicine technologists are projected each year, on average, over the decade. Many of those openings are expected to result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force, such as retirement ( Occupational Outlook Handbook , 2022).   #### Salary information  According to the IUPUI First Destination Survey in 2020, the average starting salary reported for School of Medicine graduates with a bachelor's degree was $57,035, and the median salary was $56,673.  The national median annual salary for nuclear medicine technologists was $78,760 in 2021 ( Occupational Outlook Handbook ).  (This section is intended for informational purposes, not prediction of actual salary.)   #### Graduate and professional school paths  Nuclear medicine technology students often pursue advanced degrees in the following areas:   ### Quick facts   #### Sample coursework   #### Possible careers  *These careers require additional training or education.   #### Where could I work?   ### Complementing interests  R Realistic  I Investigative  S Social  [Get your interest code](https://acd.iupui.edu/explore/choose-your-major/connect-majors-to-careers/interests/index.html?)   ### Where to get more information  [IU School of Medicine](https://medicine.iu.edu/undergraduate-health-professions)  IU School of Medicine  [Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging](https://www.snmmi.org/)  Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging  [Nuclear Medicine Technology Certification Board](https://www.nmtcb.org/)  Nuclear Medicine Technology Certification Board   ### Health and Life Sciences Cluster  This major belongs to the Health and Life Sciences (HLS) cluster.

Please use the request link at the bottom of the page if you'd like to schedule a presentation. If you prefer an asynchronous format, as a U110 instructor, you can go to the U110 FYS course shell in Canvas and access a variety of career modules related to these presentations.   ### Descriptions of career presentations   #### Career planning foundations  Many students come to IUPUI to prepare for a career, but have few or no concrete plans . This interactive session demonstrates the importance of setting major and career exploration goals now. Students will be able to identify personal traits to consider and will understand career exploration using information, people resources, and their own experiences. This presentation is ideal for introducing career planning to students (25–30 minutes).   #### FOCUS results  The FOCUS assessment, our free online assessment tool, can help students better articulate their values, interests, skills, and personality traits and can assist students in making connections between that information and major and career options that might be a good fit for their unique characteristics.  In this presentation, we discuss the purpose and benefits of assessments in career planning, provide insights into students’ results, and demonstrate how the instrument can be used as a resource for additional career exploration. You may choose to play this FOCUS overview video to introduce how to navigate FOCUS prior to students taking the assessment.  [this FOCUS overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho_P-gUlikA&feature=youtu.be)  Students should use the FOCUS assignment to complete the assessment and begin processing on their own prior to this presentation (30–45 minutes or based on time available).   #### Networking and informational interviews  Encourage students to get the inside scoop on careers by speaking to people in their fields. People connections are a vital part of career exploration and planning. Students will learn what networking is, who is in their network, and how they can grow their network and make professional connections. This presentation also teaches students the power of informational interviewing and how to use this form of networking to learn about occupations, positions, and organizations. We discuss how and where to find contacts, what to ask, and the importance of following up. This presentation can accompany the informational interviewing major career resource guide (30–45 minutes).   #### Parallel planning for health care majors  Parallel planning is an expectation for all students entering health and life science fields. Most students don’t know about the wide variety of majors and careers available to them in the health care arena and developing a parallel plan early in their college careers ensures that students have explored all of their options and that they have targeted majors for which they will be both engaged in and admissible to. This presentation covers the importance of parallel planning and exposes students to available resources for developing a parallel plan. The parallel planning major career resource guide can be used to accompany this presentation (30–40 minutes).   #### Fun with career games  While formal presentations are great, sometimes everyone needs a change of pace. Let us facilitate fun career-related games that sneak learning in along the way! Choices include:  Majors for Humanity Like Cards Against Humanity, Majors for Humanity is a hilariously fun game! It exposes students to those majors that can solve problems in today’s society. Students are encouraged to think outside the box and make a case for why the major they choose from their cards is the one to offer the skills and abilities to solve the problem presented.  Career Taboo Just like in Taboo, Career Taboo has words you cannot say. Students take turns in describing a career without using the obvious words to describe it so others can guess the career. A student has one minute to get through as many careers as they can. Each guessed card is a point for the team, the team that ends with the most points wins! Students will then create a description of their preferred career without using the job title and sharing with other players to see if anyone can guess it.  Major Taboo Just like in Taboo, Major Taboo has words you cannot say. Students take turns in describing a major without using the obvious words to describe it so others can guess the major. A student has one minute to get through as many majors as they can. Each guessed card is a point for the team, the team that ends with the most points wins! Students will then create a description of their preferred career without using any names of majors and sharing with other players to see if anyone can guess it. In addition, there is a one-minute challenge for students to list as many of the majors at IUPUI as they can think of.  Values Card Sort This activity helps students prioritize what is important to them to see in their future careers. Most students haven’t thought of how their values and ethics fit with the career path they’ve set out on. This allows students to place these in order of what is most important and not so important for them personally. Discussions will encourage students to think about how they can use this list to make informed decisions.  Students report that they feel better able to make an informed decision regarding their major and career options after these presentations. Click below to schedule yours today!

This is the time to lean into anything that piques your interest. Take advantage of it and let yourself be curious. Don’t pass up on an opportunity because it wasn’t something you originally planned on. If you’re wondering about a class, take it!  If you could be any major in your cluster, what would it be? Why? If I could pursue any major in HLS, it would be community health. The coursework looks so interesting! And I love the idea of being able to have a positive impact on my community in this way, as well as studying what \"health\" looks like from person to person.  Biography : I grew up in a somewhat small town in southern Illinois, about half an hour from St. Louis. I was a proud member of the marching band all throughout high school and have carried that appreciation with me through to today. I moved to Indianapolis in 2013 and began my academic career at IUPUI that fall. I never imagined that I would end up majoring in philosophy, but with some encouragement from my advisor, I took my first class and never thought twice about it. Beyond falling in love with philosophy, I also fell in love with IUPUI and knew that I wanted a career here working with students. Outside of IUPUI, you can find me trying to bake my way through The Great British Baking Show recipe books, with very mild success. I also enjoy reading, testing new ways to make coffee, and spending as much time with my family and nephews as I can. "

    "body": "  ## About the computer information technology major  Computer and information technology (CIT) students learn to identify, design, implement, and evaluate solutions to meet information technology needs. The program offers four concentrations: networking systems, information security, web development, and data management. Each concentration is designed to provide an applications-oriented, practical education, and hands-on experience. You'll use current and emerging technology to provide software and hardware solutions to business problems, adding value to virtually any organization.  Skills and abilities this major develops: attention to detail, broad knowledge of computing, communication, design, implementation and evaluation of systems or processes, and problem solving.   ### Engaged learning experiences  Regardless of your major or future career, engaged learning is vital to your present and future. It makes you more marketable for jobs and professional schools upon graduation, it enables you to build deeper connections with faculty and staff in your field of study, and it makes your learning personal by connecting your interests and values with the curriculum from your classes.

These include:  Just taking the courses, however, is not enough. You must also do well. Grades are very important . This includes grades in all courses taken at any university while completing your undergraduate degree. Consequently, you want to major in a subject in which you are interested and one in which you will work hard to do well.

    "body": "  ## Identify your VIPS  If you want to make good, informed decisions about majors and careers, first look at your values, interests, personality, and skills (VIPS). You won't use all of them within your career, but your BEST major and career choices allow you to incorporate many aspects of your VIPS.  Values are deeply held beliefs about what you MUST have in your life for it to be worth living. Some folks want “enough” money—however they define it. Some want security or stability. Others want power or prestige. Maybe you want creativity or independence. Values act as a filter for the other pieces. It is important to identify and to consider your values as you approach career decisions since your work will influence the ways in which you can live out your values.  Interests are things you LIKE to do, can get immersed in doing, and lose track of time while involved in them. It is likely you won't use all your interests within your career. However, if you really enjoy a certain task or activity, you are likely to stick with it long enough to master it. Think about how you can incorporate your interests into your major and career planning. It will be easier to stay motivated!  Personality is your way of doing things—your style. This includes things like whether you need to be around people or need quiet time to recharge your energy level. How do you process information? Are you detail or big-picture oriented? How do you make decisions? Are you one who uses your head or your heart? Do you prefer your time to be scheduled or spontaneous? Careers can be more comfortable for people with complementary personalities.  Skills are those things you do well. These can be natural talents, strengths, or the abilities you have acquired through education or training. The abilities you do well and LOVE are called motivated skills. You may have skills using data and information, working with equipment or things, or valuable people skills. During your time at IUPUI, refine your existing skills as you develop new ones. If you struggle to identify your skills, ask yourself what you do well, where you have been successful, or even where others have sought out your help. These are your skills and strengths!   ### Pay attention to your VIPS  Your best, most satisfying career choices allow you to incorporate many aspects of your VIPS.   #### Values   #### Interests   #### Personality   #### Skills  Are you struggling to identify your VIPS? Assessments can help you find the right words to describe what makes you unique.  If you have questions or need a resource in an accessible format, please contact Mike Slocum.   ### Learn about best-fit majors and careers for you  [Download the interest code booklet](https://indiana.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/msteams_92d57a/ET0ZMGp8A3FPiGeG3i004iQBBUn1gMvOLGf6EJttVrmBug?e=SmCtX1) "

You salivate over jars of almond butter, spicy salsas, and green curries. But how do those products get there? What’s the channel from concept to consumer? That’s supply chain management. Think of a product on an invisible conveyor belt moving through forecasting, inventory planning, purchasing, manufacturing, delivering, and even returning. Supply chain managers plan, schedule, and control the flow of goods to help companies stay competitive and to control costs. They build the critical bridges between suppliers, companies, and consumers.   #### Degree map  One of the most difficult tasks of being a college student is figuring out what classes to take and when to take them.

Work or involvement experience while at IUPUI: LHSI intern, vice president of programming for Sigma Kappa, and program coordinator for Undergraduate Women in Science (UWIS).  Advice to students: Follow your gut.  Brief bio : I am originally from Veedersburg, Indiana, which is a small town in Indiana with only one stoplight. I'm very school-focused, but I still enjoy hanging out with my friends, getting crafty, and reading poetry books. I'm a big music person, and I will always be listening to music, especially Taylor Swift. I also really enjoy the color pink. After graduating from IUPUI, I hope to attend the IU School of Medicine.

    "body": "  ## Match your interests to majors and careers  Dr. John Holland theorized that people and work environments can be loosely classified into six different groups. While you may have some interests in and similarities to several of the six groups, you may be attracted primarily to two or three of the areas. These two or three letters are your interest code .  [interest code](https://indiana.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/msteams_92d57a/EXxLk3hwOs1Plvlhwf5yMDQBnnp1RvjXtc-oSeAkfD_lbA?e=4DDMG2)  Read the descriptions of each theme below. List the group you would be drawn to first, then your second choice, and finally your third choice. (For example, if you choose R then E and then S, you would most resemble the realistic type, somewhat less resemble the enterprising type, and resemble the social type even less.)  The types not in your code are the types you resemble least of all. Most people, and most jobs, are some combination of two or three of the Holland interest areas.  If you have questions or need a resource in an accessible format, please contact Mike Slocum .   ### Holland occupational themes   #### R (realistic theme)  Nicknamed \"the doers,\" realistic people enjoy activities that involve primarily mechanical and physical abilities. You will find them in areas such as construction, health and fitness, sports and recreation, repair, technology, and similar activities. They prefer working with tools or their hands and enjoy nature and adventurous outdoor activities. They are motivated by hands-on, tangible results.   #### I (investigative theme)  Nicknamed \"the thinkers,\" investigative people enjoy gathering, analyzing, and interpreting information, as well as uncovering new facts or theories. They tend to enjoy science and are quite curious. They prefer academic or research environments that will allow them to develop ideas, and they enjoy working alone rather than in groups. They are motivated by curiosity, learning, and knowledge.   #### A (artistic theme)  Nicknamed \"the creators,\" artistic people value aesthetic qualities and have a need for self-expression. They enjoy being spectators (rather than participants) of the arts and art activities. They are as likely to express this interest through leisure and recreational activities as they are through professional practice. They are motivated by self-expression.   #### S (social theme)  Nicknamed \"the helpers,\" social people like to work with others in a helping relationship, usually through teaching, instructing, advising, counseling, or customer service. They prefer social environments that will allow them to interact regularly with people, work in groups or teams, and solve problems through sharing thoughts and feelings. They are motivated by helping others.   #### E (enterprising theme)  Nicknamed \"the persuaders,\" enterprising people are considered born leaders. Competitive by nature, they like to manage, direct, or persuade others in a business or corporate setting. They seek positions of leadership, power, and status and enjoy guiding others toward specific organizational goals and economic success. They are also most likely to take personal and financial risks. They are motivated by their ability to persuade others.   #### C (conventional theme)  Nicknamed \"the organizers,\" conventional people enjoy activities centered around the detail, organization, and accuracy of data. They often enjoy mathematical and data management activities and can be found in occupations such as accounting, investment banking, and insurance. They enjoy bringing order to data, information, and objects and are motivated by organizational tasks.   ### Learn about best-fit majors and careers for you  [Download the interest code booklet](https://indiana.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/msteams_92d57a/EXxLk3hwOs1Plvlhwf5yMDQBnnp1RvjXtc-oSeAkfD_lbA?e=4DDMG2) "

Having a plan is smart, but be willing to alter the plan. As you experience and learn about new opportunities, your plans may shift and that's okay. Be willing to let those experiences and opportunities guide you.  If you could be any major in your cluster, what would it be? Why?: I would love to be a health services management major! Since this major combines health care and business, I think it would be a perfect match for me.  Biography : I have lived in the Indianapolis area for most of my life. I enjoy traveling, and I have a goal to visit all 50 states. I love food and going on food adventures to eat at interesting restaurants. When I'm at home, I love watching cooking shows and sitcoms. My favorite shows are Friends and Parks and Recreation . I also enjoy reading, practicing yoga, playing board games, and relaxing outside when the weather is nice. "

    "body": "  ## About the artificial intelligence major  The next generation of artificial intelligence (AI) is pervasive.

Philosophers address a diverse array of deep, challenging, and profoundly important questions, such as the nature of the self and of personal identity; the existence or nonexistence of God; the nature of time, mind, language, and science; the sources and limits of human knowledge; the nature of the good life; the foundations of state authority; the requirements of social justice; and the nature of art, beauty, and aesthetic experience.

    "body": "  ## About the health data sciences major  Health data science is a rapidly growing, interdisciplinary field requiring a diverse set of skills to extract knowledge and insights from data. Health data scientists will be at the center of an estimated $300 billion value added to the American health sector annually by big data and analytics.  The Bachelor of Science in Health Data Science features an interdisciplinary curriculum that integrates biostatistics, computer science, and informatics to create an attractive package for employers like Eli Lilly, FitBit, and IU Health that work with health data locally, nationally, and internationally. Many students in the major complete an internship, which increases their employability after graduation.  Studies and abilities this major develops : biostatistics, computer programming, management, communication skills, analytical skills, understanding of diversity, and knowledge of the health care industry.   ### Engaged learning experiences  Regardless of your major or future career, engaged learning is vital to your present and future. It makes you more marketable for jobs and professional schools upon graduation, it enables you to build deeper connections with faculty and staff in your field of study, and it makes your learning personal by connecting your interests and values with the curriculum from your classes.

This de-centralized model is explained in the video below.   ### Career development in University College  University College has unique resources to help students determine their best major and career fit before entering their degree-granting schools. Learn more with the video below.   ### STEP model  Career development is a process, and in University College, career consultants break that process into four phases that make up the STEP model. This model, as well as appropriate questions and flags to watch for, are discussed in this video.   ### Additional resources  Additional resources have been available for first-year seminar faculty and advisors in the past, and more have recently been created. Combined with Academic and Career Development’s new cluster model, you can incorporate career interventions into your course more easily than ever. "

    "body": "  # Melissa Cooper  Senior Career Consultant, EPP Cluster  [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/melissa-cooper-8022a36/)  Education:  Professional Experience :  Advice to students: Study hard and make getting good grades a priority, but not the only priority. Look beyond the classroom and get engaged in a student organization, RISE program, or leadership development opportunity. Your contributions to IUPUI help make our campus a better one. We need your stories, your experiences, and your ideas as we move into our second 50 years of operation.  If you could be any major in your cluster, what would it be? Why?: Organizational leadership—for the flexibility to develop leadership and human resources management skills (particularly talent development, which would have been the area of business I would have gone into had I not been bitten by the higher education bug), plus the opportunity to add an outside minor of my choice (and mine, of course, would be music).  Biography : I hail from the Lake Cumberland region of south central Kentucky.  After graduate school, I moved to the Louisville area, where I worked for a few years before marrying Eric Cooper and moving to Indianapolis with him. When I am not at the office, you will usually find me reading a book, playing my baby grand piano, or training for yet another half marathon on our suburban trail. I also brought a bunch of Kentucky cookbooks with me when I moved here, and according to my IUPUI coworkers, I make some pretty amazing bourbon balls every December! My husband, Eric, is a scientist at a local pharmaceutical company. Our daughter, Courtney, is a recent college graduate working as a marketing campaign director for a local financial institution. We have a very spoiled Bengal cat named Cocoa who has been our mostly benevolent household boss since 2005. My husband and I were both first-generation college students who ended up leaving rural hometowns for the big city. I have had an amazing journey, and I am looking forward to what comes next. "

Find people whose approach to life and work you trust and respect, and ask them all your questions. Most people are very willing to share about their experiences if you ask! By seeking out wisdom held by those you trust, you can learn more about yourself and what you value most.  If you could be any major in your cluster, what would it be? Why ?: I think a major in community health would be interesting! With my background in sociology, I would especially be interested in thinking about the delivery of information to diverse communities with cultural competency in mind.  Biography : I grew up in Pasadena, California, and loved growing up around the National Parks and scenery of the western United States. After college, I lived in Washington D.C. for about 10 years and have lived in Indiana since 2010. My favorite things are spending time with my family (I'm married, with two daughters), having a good laugh, hiking/spending time outside, and traveling. Our greatest family adventure to date was living and working in Ireland for six months! "

    "body": "  ## Make an appointment  University College student success advisors are knowledgeable about undergraduate programs and requirements, as well as resources for support. They can help you select courses and prepare for registration. If you want to further explore major and career options, our career consultants can help. Learn how to consider your own values, interests, skills, and personality as you evaluate your career path.  Connect with your student success advisors, career consultants, and cluster team members via email or individual appointment. Appointments are available Monday through Friday; please call (317) 274-4856 for availability or schedule online with the form linked below.   ### Schedule an appointment  Sit down with an advisor for 30 minutes to discuss your long-term plans, decide on classes for an upcoming semester, or resolve any academic holds.  We realize that schedules and distance can make coming in to see an advisor a challenge, so our office offers virtual advising, too. With virtual advising, you schedule an appointment and meet with your advisor in a virtual meeting space (internet connection and a web cam are needed).  If you are a current student at IUPUI, use the link below to schedule either an in-person or online appointment with an advisor. Otherwise, please call the office at (317) 274-4856.  Schedule your appointment   ### No-show procedures  You are considered a \"no-show\" when you do not check in for your appointments at the front desk/virtually OR when you arrive more than 10 minutes late.  Consequences of a no-show include the following:  If you are aware that you cannot make your appointment, please contact the office before the scheduled appointment time to cancel or to reschedule.   ### Drop-ins  Meet quickly with a peer advisor virtually to answer a simple question or two about your degree, identify helpful campus resources, complete a required form, or make a change to your current class schedule. Please note that record holds cannot be cleared during a drop-in meeting. Quick 15-minute questions can be answered on a first-come, first-served basis.  View the drop-in schedule "

Don't be afraid to give something a shot because now is the time to go for it.  If you could be any major in your cluster, what would it be? Why?: I would choose tourism, conventions, and event management because Indianapolis is a growing destination for conventions and sporting events. There are a lot of opportunities to gain experience while in school and to gain employment upon graduation.  Biography : I moved to Indiana in grade school, so I think I have been here long enough to be considered a Hoosier. I like to experiment in the kitchen and learn new cooking techniques. I am married and have two sons. My husband works for Indianapolis Public Schools as an athletic director, my oldest son is an outstanding scholar who runs track, and my baby is new. "

    "body": "  ## About the physics major  Physics is the study of matter and energy, from the smallest scale (elementary particles) to the largest (evolution of stars and galaxies). In this sense, physics is foundational to all other sciences.  As a physics student, you'll solve technical problems by learning to analyze complex relationships in mathematical terms. Because of this broad-based and flexible problem-solving background, physics graduates find employment in a wide variety of specialty areas and fields, some of which are not directly associated with physics.  Skills and abilities this major develops: data acquisition and analysis, math skills, problem solving, laboratory methods, computer skills, understanding theoretical concepts, and technical writing.   ### Engaged learning experiences  Regardless of your major or future career, engaged learning is vital to your present and future. It makes you more marketable for jobs and professional schools upon graduation, it enables you to build deeper connections with faculty and staff in your field of study, and it makes your learning personal by connecting your interests and values with the curriculum from your classes.

About 2,100 openings for physicists and astronomers are projected each year, on average, over the decade. Many of those openings are expected to result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force, such as retirement ( Occupational Outlook Handbook , 2022).   #### Salary information  According to the IUPUI First Destination Survey in 2021, the average starting salary reported for School of Science graduates was $45,303, and the median salary was $40,000.  The national median annual salary for physicists and astronomers was $147,450 in 2021 ( Occupational Outlook Handbook ).  (This section is intended for informational purposes, not prediction of actual salary.)   #### Graduate and professional school paths  Physicists and astronomers typically need a Ph.D. for jobs in research and academia, and a master’s degree is expected for some roles.

    "body": "  ## Majors and careers for enterprising interests   ### For people influencers  Majors and careers can be clustered into six broad interest areas that correspond to six different personality types. Based on the research of Dr. John Holland, this clustering system provides a preliminary way to identify undergraduate majors and careers that might be a satisfying fit for you. Because personality, majors, and careers are too complex to be described by a single interest theme, you will see that the lists below have a three-letter code to more accurately describe majors and careers using a combination of related interests (in order of importance). This “enterprising” page reflects the interest cluster that ranks the “E” theme first, but be sure to review the other five clusters to see if any of those themes (R, I, A, S, C) are more descriptive of your interests.   ### Am I enterprising?  Check off your interests, values, abilities, and qualities to find out.  These are characteristics of the enterprising type. Enterprising people like to work with people to influence, persuade, and lead them and to achieve organizational or financial goals. They tend to be assertive, ambitious, and energetic. If this sounds like you, read on. If not, try one of the other five interest clusters.   ### Enterprising majors  The following is a small sample of majors an enterprising person might find interesting.

No single questionnaire, assessment, or person can tell you what you should pursue. In order to make the best choices, it is important to consider your unique combination of interests, values, abilities, personality, and experiences.  Keep in mind that majors and careers can accommodate a wide range of interests; an exact fit is not necessary for academic and career satisfaction. The majors and careers above are suggested only as starting points for your exploration. Specific major and career decisions can be discussed in more detail with your academic advisor or career counselor.   ### More information on careers and advising  [Schools, majors, and degrees offered at IUPUI](http://www.iupui.edu/academic/schoolsdepts.htm)  Schools, majors, and degrees offered at IUPUI  Check sheets for each IUPUI major  [Course descriptions for IUPUI](https://bulletins.iu.edu/iupui/)  Course descriptions for IUPUI  What can I do with a major I choose?

    "body": "  ## Purdue pre-agriculture programs   ### Purdue College of Agriculture  Students may begin their college coursework at IUPUI, but must transfer to Purdue West Lafayette in their sophomore or junior year to complete the degree.  The College of Agriculture at Purdue University West Lafayette is one of the world’s leading colleges of agricultural, food, life, and natural resource sciences. As a land-grant institution, Purdue is committed to preparing students to make a difference, wherever their careers take them, stretching the frontiers of science to find solutions to some of our most pressing global challenges and, through Purdue Extension and engagement programs, helping the people of Indiana, the nation, and the world improve their lives and livelihoods.​​​​​​  The Purdue agriculture program at IUPUI is a joint venture between the College of Agriculture at Purdue West Lafayette and IUPUI. IUPUI does not have an agriculture program; rather, IUPUI offers students the option to start their academic career at IUPUI and then transfer to Purdue in West Lafayette.  Students work on general education courses, especially in science and math, during their time at IUPUI. Depending on the intended degree program, students will need to transfer to Purdue by their sophomore or junior year, meaning a student will spend one to two years at IUPUI and have anywhere between two to three years left at Purdue in the College of Agriculture.  Admission to Purdue in the College of Agriculture is not guaranteed. Students have to apply to Purdue by the stated deadlines . Students who are pre-agriculture can contact the College of Agriculture to receive a better understanding of degree programs and opportunities, as well as information about course transferability. Students are also encouraged to work with a University College advisor in the STEM cluster to discuss IUPUI course selection and a timeline for transferring to Purdue West Lafayette.

    "body": "  ## About the motorsports engineering major  IUPUI is the first university in the United States to offer a bachelor's degree in motorsports engineering, which is designed to prepare you for careers in the motorsports industry as well as automotive-related companies. The focus is on teaching fundamentals of engineering and includes hands-on projects that involve designing, analyzing, and building of actual systems.  Skills and abilities this major develops : engineering design, project management, complex problem solving, mechanical skills, creativity, listening skills, performance testing, teamwork, and technical writing   ### Engaged learning experiences  Regardless of your major or future career, engaged learning is vital to your present and future. It makes you more marketable for jobs and professional schools upon graduation, it enables you to build deeper connections with faculty and staff in your field of study, and it makes your learning personal by connecting your interests and values with the curriculum from your classes. Check out the three ideas below for places to get started, or learn more at IUPUI’s Institute for Engaged Learning website.

Despite limited employment growth, about 17,900 openings for mechanical engineers are projected each year, on average, over the decade. Many of those openings are expected to result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force, such as retirement ( Occupational Outlook Handbook , 2022).   #### Salary information  According to the IUPUI First Destination Survey in 2021, the average starting salary reported for School of Engineering and Technology graduates was $58,879, and the median salary was $60,000.  The median salary for mechanical engineers was $95,300 in 2021 ( Occupational Outlook Handbook ).

    "body": "  ## About the radiation therapy major  Radiation therapy involves the use of different forms of ionizing radiation for the treatment of benign and malignant tumors. Radiation therapists administer the prescribed dose of ionizing radiation to specific sites of the patient’s body as directed by a physician. They operate various types of equipment, including high-energy linear accelerators, and work with radioactive materials. Radiation therapists also observe the clinical progress of the patient, note the first signs of complication, and determine when treatment should be withheld until a physician may be consulted.  Skills and abilities this major develops: effective communication, ability to think critically and problem solve in a health care environment, ability to perform radiation dose calculations, ability to assess treatment plans and apply basic research methods, and ability to evaluate a patient’s therapeutic responses.

    "body": "  ## About the political science major  Political science is the study of government and politics and involves analyzing how different forms of government operate. You'll learn theories behind different governments, reasons for governmental change, and failure to apply those theories to current political problems, as well as examine the human element of politics. You'll gain insight into how government works in Indiana, the United States, and all over the world. In this major, you'll become a critical observer, informed, an active participant, and prepared for a variety of careers.  Skills and abilities this major develops include: problem solving, public speaking, communication, research, and an understanding of politics (IU School of Liberal Arts, 2019).   ### Engaged learning experiences  Regardless of your major or future career, engaged learning is vital to your present and future. It makes you more marketable for jobs and professional schools upon graduation, it enables you to build deeper connections with faculty and staff in your field of study, and it makes your learning personal by connecting your interests and values with the curriculum from your classes. Check out the three ideas below for places to get started, or learn more at IUPUI’s Institute for Engaged Learning website.

Both shorter and longer immersion programs are also available.   ### Opportunities after graduation   #### Career opportunities  Employment of political scientists is expected to grow 6% from 2021 to 2031, as fast as the average for all occupations. About 600 openings for political scientists are projected each year, on average, over the decade. Many of those openings are expected to result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force, such as retirement ( Occupational Outlook Handbook , 2022).   #### Salary information  According to the IUPUI First Destination Survey in 2021, the average starting salary reported by graduates with a bachelor's degree in p olitical science was $34,488, and the median salary was $37,000 .  The national median annual salary for political scientists was $122,510 in May 2021 ( Occupational Outlook Handbook ).  (This section is intended for informational purposes, not prediction of actual salary.)   #### Graduate and professional school paths  This major can be a key pathway to law school. In addition to law, political science majors often pursue advanced degrees in the following areas:   ### Quick facts   #### Sample coursework   #### Possible careers  *These careers require additional training or education.   #### Where could I work?   ### Complementing interests  E Enterprising  S Social  I Investigative  [Get your interest code](https://acd.iupui.edu/explore/choose-your-major/connect-majors-to-careers/interests/index.html?)   ### Where to get more information  [Department of Political Science](https://liberalarts.iupui.edu/departments/polisci/?)

    "body": "  ## About the electrical engineering major  Electrical engineering deals with electricity—from the tiniest computer circuitry to large-scale electronics systems. They design, develop, and manufacture equipment that produces and distributes electricity, as well as equipment such as electric motors and machinery. They may also design and develop devices made up of electronic components. Work could be in consumer electronics and optics, power efficiency and storage, telecommunications devices, broadcasting systems, analog circuitry, or many other areas.  Skills and abilities this major develops : analysis and problem solving skills, math knowledge, teamwork, attention to detail, and communication skills (interpersonal, speaking and writing skills).   ### Engaged learning experiences  Regardless of your major or future career, engaged learning is vital to your present and future. It makes you more marketable for jobs and professional schools upon graduation, it enables you to build deeper connections with faculty and staff in your field of study, and it makes your learning personal by connecting your interests and values with the curriculum from your classes.

The \"Crossroads of America\" is now a major international freight hub. Record numbers of immigrants from places like Mexico, South Asia, and West Africa are transforming our cultural landscape. Meanwhile, Hoosiers are serving abroad in the military, in the Peace Corps, as missionaries, or as members of the international business community.

    "body": "  ## About the philosophy major  Philosophy is the study of the general understanding of the whole of reality. In this major, you'll draw on the insights of the great historical philosophers, what has been learned in all other major fields of study, and the rich perspective embodied within our ordinary ways of thinking.  You'll address a diverse array of deep and profoundly important questions. Examples include the nature of the self and of personal identity; the existence or nonexistence of God; the nature of such phenomena as time, mind, and language; and the sources and limits of human knowledge.  Skills and abilities this major develops: critical thinking, communication, analytical thinking, and research (IU School of Liberal Arts, 2018).   ### Engaged learning experiences  Regardless of your major or future career, engaged learning is vital to your present and future. It makes you more marketable for jobs and professional schools upon graduation, it enables you to build deeper connections with faculty and staff in your field of study, and it makes your learning personal by connecting your interests and values with the curriculum from your classes.

You'll be trained to address pressing societal needs related to law enforcement, the judicial system, corrections, and national security. You'll also be prepared to pursue a graduate degree in law or criminal justice. Classes cover research methods, criminological theory and policy, criminal law, courts, corrections, and policing. You can also choose to study topics such as homicide, terrorism, juvenile justice, and cybercrime.   #### Degree map  One of the most difficult tasks of being a college student is figuring out what classes to take and when to take them.

    "body": "  ## About the German major  The world languages and cultures major focuses on general knowledge of a country and its language, history, culture, political and economic systems, and literature. You'll gain skills in cognition, verbal abilities, competency in another language, cultural awareness, and an understanding of globalization. This major will help you learn the multiple connections between language, culture, and applications to other disciplines.  Skills and abilities this major develops : cultural competency, foreign language, public speaking, critical thinking, and communication (IU School of Liberal Arts, 2017).   ### Engaged learning experiences  Regardless of your major or future career, engaged learning is vital to your present and future. It makes you more marketable for jobs and professional schools upon graduation, it enables you to build deeper connections with faculty and staff in your field of study, and it makes your learning personal by connecting your interests and values with the curriculum from your classes.

About 10,400 openings for interpreters and translators are projected each year, on average, over the decade. Many of those openings are expected to result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force, such as retirement ( Occupational Outlook Handbook , 2022).   #### Salary information  According to the IUPUI First Destination Survey in 2021, the average starting salary reported for School of Liberal Art graduates was $44,206, and the median salary was $38,800.  The mean starting salary for liberal arts graduates who majored in world languages and cultures was $44,361 for the class of May 2020, according to the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE).

    "body": "  ## Majors and careers for realistic interests   ### For the technically and athletically inclined  Majors and careers can be organized into six broad interest areas that correspond to six different interest types. Based on the research of Dr. John Holland, the system provides a preliminary way to identify undergraduate majors and careers that might be a satisfying fit for you. Because personality, majors, and careers are too complex to be described by a single interest theme, you will see that the lists below have a three-letter code to more accurately describe majors and careers using a combination of related interests (in order of importance). This “realistic” page reflects the interest cluster that ranks the “R” theme first, but be sure to review the other five clusters to see if any of those themes (I, A, S, E, C) are more descriptive of your interests.   ### Am I realistic?  Check off your interests, values, abilities, and qualities to find out.  These are characteristics of the realistic type. Realistic people are aggressive, prefer concrete versus abstract tasks, and are less sociable and less skilled at interpersonal interactions. They have athletic or mechanical ability and often prefer to work outdoors with objects, machines, tools, plants, or animals. If this sounds like you, read on. If not, try one of the other five interest clusters.   ### Realistic majors  The following is a small sample of majors a realistic person might find interesting.

Definitions of the above job titles can be found at O-NET Online . For additional realistic majors or careers, consult your academic advisor or a career counselor.  [O-NET Online](http://www.onetonline.org/)   ### Selecting a realistic major and career  Selecting a major and career is a very involved process, requiring careful evaluation of yourself as well as academic and occupational information. No single questionnaire, assessment, or person can tell you what you should pursue. In order to make the best choices, it is important to consider your unique combination of interests, values, abilities, personality, and experiences.  Keep in mind that majors and careers can accommodate a wide range of interests; an exact fit is not necessary for academic and career satisfaction. The majors and careers above are suggested only as starting points for your exploration. Specific major and career decisions can be discussed in more detail with your academic advisor or career counselor.   ### More information on careers and advising  [Schools, majors, and degrees offered at IUPUI](http://www.iupui.edu/academic/schoolsdepts.htm)  Schools, majors, and degrees offered at IUPUI  Check sheets for each IUPUI major  [Course descriptions for IUPUI](https://bulletins.iu.edu/iupui/)  Course descriptions for IUPUI  What can I do with a major I choose?

    "body": "  ## About the nursing major  Nursing majors study current trends in health care and focus on wellness/illness concepts and delivery of care in hospital and community-based settings. While nursing relies heavily on the social abilities of the person giving care, it also requires a large base of scientific knowledge. Nursing is a large occupational arena involving diverse and changing roles and includes areas of specialty in surgery, maternity, pediatrics, emergency room, intensive care, and more.  Skills and abilities that this major develops: critical thinking and problem solving, communication skills, teamwork, cultural competency, knowledge of human anatomy, and physiology.   #### Engaged learning experiences  Regardless of your major or future career, engaged learning is vital to your present and future. It makes you more marketable for jobs and professional schools upon graduation, it enables you to build deeper connections with faculty and staff in your field of study, and it makes your learning personal by connecting your interests and values with the curriculum from your classes. Check out the three ideas below for places to get started, or learn more at IUPUI’s Institute for Engaged Learning website.

    "body": "  ## Finding the career for your major  For some majors, the connection between what you study and what you do for a career (or at least where you will start your career) is fairly clear. Accounting majors generally work as accountants. As they begin their careers, nursing majors generally go on to work as nurses. Initially, education majors are usually found at the front of a classroom.  For other majors, the connection between what you study and what you eventually do for a career is not as direct. Psychology majors may go into a helping profession, but they could also land a job in an advertising firm. Philosophy majors may choose to be philosophers in the sense that they complete a Ph.D. in philosophy, or they could apply their skills in logic and analysis to a career in law. In these cases, what you do with your time outside the classroom (e.g., research, service, relevant work, internships, leadership) could have as much impact on your career path as your choice of major.  Whether you are exploring multiple majors or searching for information about your chosen field, we can help you connect majors to careers. Learn about the typical career areas and the types of employers that hire people with each major, as well as strategies to be a highly competitive candidate. Use this information to create your plan for success, and talk with us if you have questions!   ### Helpful resources  [What can I do with this major?](https://whatcanidowiththismajor.com/major)  [IU career guides](https://cdc.indiana.edu/career-guides/index.html) "

    "body": "  # Milena Mileva  Student Success Advisor, HLS Cluster  Education:  Professional Experience  Advice to students: Keep an open mind. Embrace the challenges and the opportunities you will find in and outside the classroom. Seek change that will make you a better you—a more inquisitive, more resilient, at times even more vulnerable, lifelong learner. Start those self-talks (and then, the conversations you have with others) with the positives first—what went well, what good outcomes could be expected, what you appreciate the most. Staying positive will make the good times even more enjoyable and the hard times easier to get through.  If you could be any major in your cluster, what would it be? Why?: I would choose a cytotechnology major. I find it fascinating that with the technology we have today and the knowledge we continue to develop about the blueprint of our cells, we can not only detect emerging cancer at its earliest stage, but be proactive with choosing the optimal treatment for cure. Early detection of cancer is, quite literally, a matter of life and death.  Biography : I was born and raised in Bulgaria, a beautiful country hidden behind the Iron Curtain for too many decades. I come from a progressive family, highly invested in education and family values. My love for reading was nurtured by the desire to explore the world I was not allowed to travel. I loved walking the ancient Roman cobblestone streets or spending after-school hours with friends in the ancient Roman amphitheatre. My sense of belonging to the modern world was born when I came to IUPUI as a graduate student in 1998. I fell in love with the campus and the people. Today, Indiana is my home (and IUPUI—literally my home as I continue to spend the greater part of my days on campus). This is where I made lifelong friendships, where I am raising my son, where I share the joys of life with my husband, and cuddle with our cats. I love meeting new people, dining out with friends, cooking at home, and hopefully soon returning to Beef and Boards, and other theatres, for live shows and concerts. I love gardening and hiking out in my neighborhood parks. Traveling to new places, near and far, is always a thrilling and memorable experience. "

    "body": "  ## About the community health major  Community health majors are prepared to work in entry-level positions in public health agencies, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), hospitals, health care centers, and other organizations. They focus on the health and well-being of groups of people and individuals. These professionals often focus on health education and illness prevention.  Skills and abilities this major develops: research, teamwork and leadership, cultural competency, communication skills, ethical decision making, ability to analyze and evaluate, and knowledge of local and global health care systems.   ### Engaged learning experiences  Regardless of your major or future career, engaged learning is vital to your present and future. It makes you more marketable for jobs and professional schools upon graduation, it enables you to build deeper connections with faculty and staff in your field of study, and it makes your learning personal by connecting your interests and values with the curriculum from your classes. Check out the three ideas below for places to get started, or learn more at IUPUI’s Institute for Engaged Learning website.

Since 1911, the school has been dedicated to developing competent, caring professionals who are qualified to assume leadership roles in social work practice and who strive to enrich the lives of the people they touch. The Council on Social Work Education accredits the Master of Social Work program at Indiana University (continuously since 1923).  Whether you want to begin a career in social work or are preparing for an advanced leadership role in practice, research, or policy development, the IU School of Social Work sets the standards for innovative and inspired social work education. In addition to social work, the school also serves as the home of the university's Labor Studies Program. With more than 60 years of leadership in the field of labor studies and labor education, Indiana University continues to pioneer innovative and quality educational opportunities in this field.   #### Degree map  One of the most difficult tasks of being a college student is figuring out what classes to take and when to take them. In order to make the process a little easier, each major at IUPUI has its own degree map outlining the path you should take to graduate as quickly as possible.

    "body": "  ## About the English major  English majors develop both analytical and creative thinking skills. You'll gain many transferable skills, including paying attention to detail, interpreting media, and understanding how people communicate through poetry, fiction, nonfiction, film, and speaking. You'll also apply what you learn through analysis by producing work of your own with concentrations like creative writing, linguistics, writing and literacy, films studies, and literature. English majors gain a general understanding of literature and writing, while also diving deep into an area of interest.  Skills and abilities this major develops : writing, critical thinking, analysis, communication, and meeting deadlines (IU School of Liberal Arts, 2018).   ### Engaged learning experiences  Regardless of your major or future career, engaged learning is vital to your present and future. It makes you more marketable for jobs and professional schools upon graduation, it enables you to build deeper connections with faculty and staff in your field of study, and it makes your learning personal by connecting your interests and values with the curriculum from your classes. Check out the three ideas below for places to get started, or learn more at IUPUI’s Institute for Engaged Learning website.

About 15,200 openings for writers and authors are projected each year, on average, over the decade.  Employment of communications and public relations managers is projected to grow 8% from 2021 to 2031, faster than the average for all occupations. About 9,100 openings for communications and public relations managers are projected each year, on average, over the decade.  Many of the openings mentioned above are expected to result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force, such as retirement ( Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2022).   #### Salary information  According to the IUPUI First Destination Survey in 2021, the average starting salary for graduates from the School of Liberal Arts with a bachelor's degree was $43,722, and the median was $38,900.  The national mean starting salary for liberal arts graduates who majored in English was $38,987 for the class of May 2020, according to the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE).

    "body": "  ## About the computer engineering technology major  Computer engineering technology students learn to develop and to implement computer applications used every day. From microprocessors to memory systems, software, and PCs—computers have revolutionized the way we live and work. Your knowledge can influence this everyday technology: handheld devices, networks, medical equipment, smartphones, robotics, and more. An engineering technology degree allows you to use new and emerging technology to install, service, and maintain software and hardware, as well as solve problems as part of a larger project.  Skills and abilities this major develops: troubleshooting; problem solving; math skills; application and design of hardware; conducting and interpreting experiments; utilizing systems and software programs; and installing, servicing, testing, repairing and maintaining computer systems.   ### Engaged learning experiences  Regardless of your major or future career, engaged learning is vital to your present and future. It makes you more marketable for jobs and professional schools upon graduation, it enables you to build deeper connections with faculty and staff in your field of study, and it makes your learning personal by connecting your interests and values with the curriculum from your classes. Check out the three ideas below for places to get started, or learn more at IUPUI’s Institute for Engaged Learning website.

About 11,800 openings for computer network engineers are projected each year, on average, over the decade. Most of those openings are expected to result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force, such as retirement ( Occupational Outlook Handbook , 2022).   #### Salary information  According to the IUPUI First Destination Survey in 2021, the average starting salary for graduates from the School of Engineering and Technology with a bachelor's degree was $60,383, and the median was $60,320.  The national median annual salary for computer network engineers was $120,520 in 2021 ( Occupational Outlook Handbook ).  (This section is intended for informational purposes, not prediction of actual salary.)   #### Graduate and professional school paths  Many computer engineering technology graduates continue their learning over the course of their careers to keep up with rapid advances in technology.

Always seek out resources. Remember not to compare the first chapter in your book to the tenth chapter in someone else's. And always come see your student success advisor and career consultant.  If you could be any major in your cluster, what would it be? Why?: I would be an exploratory major instead of changing my major as a junior and going to school for a fifth year to earn my degree. Our first choice is rarely our best choice.  Biography: I am originally from Culver, Indiana, but I have called Indianapolis my home now for over a decade. I enjoy rooting for the Colts and the Atlanta Braves, reading/listening to audiobooks, and binge-watching TV shows. I have also completed five half marathons and am training for a full marathon in 2023.

These skilled imaging professionals use principles of radiation protection as they determine exposure factors and position patients for a variety of examinations with the use of computerized equipment.  To be admitted to the Medical Imaging Technology program, a student must be a licensed radiographer, nuclear medicine technologist, radiation therapist, sonographer, or hold an A.S. in Radiography. Many students earn their A.S. in Radiography at IUPUI first and then continue on to the B.S. in Medical Imaging Technology.  Skills and abilities this major develops: critical thinking and problem solving, use of technologies, knowledge of human anatomy and physiology, communication skills, and ability to be detail oriented.   ### Engaged learning experiences  Regardless of your major or future career, engaged learning is vital to your present and future.

    "body": "  ## About the elementary education major  As an elementary education major, you'll learn the methods of teaching and learning with children from kindergarten through sixth grade. This program will teach you how to make the most of challenges and opportunities in an urban school environment. You'll get out into the field early during your studies and start learning in the classroom.  Students are immersed in programs of study that challenge them intellectually with new models of instruction and explorations of diversity. At the conclusion of the program, you'll be fully equipped to teach your own class of diverse students in any urban, suburban, or rural school.  Skills and abilities this major develops : cultural competency, teaching, problem solving, lesson planning, and inclusivity (School of Education, 2019).   ### Engaged learning experiences  Regardless of your major or future career, engaged learning is vital to your present and future. It makes you more marketable for jobs and professional schools upon graduation, it enables you to build deeper connections with faculty and staff in your field of study, and it makes your learning personal by connecting your interests and values with the curriculum from your classes. Check out the three ideas below for places to get started, or learn more at IUPUI’s Institute for Engaged Learning website.

About 120,300 openings for kindergarten and elementary school teachers are projected each year, on average, over the decade.

HLS majors can explore careers in patient care, laboratory work, health care administration, and health education.  Around 75% of HLS majors are interested in direct patient care programs, all of which are competitive and application based, so HLS advisors and our career consultant help students carefully plan their schedules; prepare their applications; and create smart, personalized parallel plans and career goals that align with each student’s values, interests, personality, and skills. We also work with current IUPUI students who are not pursuing degrees through the School of Science to prepare for a professional school in health care. Pre-professional health programs include medicine, dentistry, optometry, physical therapy, physician assistant, occupational therapy, pharmacy, chiropractic, and even veterinary medicine. Whether you are an exercise science major wanting to become a physical therapist, a business major wanting to pursue dentistry, or a journalism major looking to be a chiropractor, we can help you prepare for professional school and achieve your goals.   ### Our HLS team   ### Student success advisors  Mikayla Bucio  Erica Gleason  Grace Klosterman  Milena Mileva  Lisa Smith  Patricia Thacker   ### Career consultant  Ryan Cook   #### Director   ### Majors in the HLS cluster  [Cytotechnology](https://hls.iupui.edu/majors/cytotechnology/index.html)  [Dental Hygiene](https://hls.iupui.edu/majors/dental-hygiene/index.html)  [Diagnostic Sonography](https://hls.iupui.edu/majors/diagnostic-sonography/index.html)  [Exercise Science](https://hls.iupui.edu/majors/exercise-science)  [Fitness Management and Personal Training](https://hls.iupui.edu/majors/fitness-management-and-personal-training)  [Health Sciences](https://hls.iupui.edu/majors/health-sciences/index.html)  [Health Services Management](https://hls.iupui.edu/majors/health-services-management/index.html)  [Histotechnology](https://hls.iupui.edu/majors/histotechnology/index.html)  [Medical Humanities and Health Studies](https://hls.iupui.edu/majors/medical-humanities/index.html)  [Medical Imaging Technology](https://hls.iupui.edu/majors/medical-imaging-technology/index.html)  [Medical Laboratory Science](https://hls.iupui.edu/majors/medical-lab-science/index.html)  [Nuclear Medicine Technology](https://hls.iupui.edu/majors/nuclear-medicine-technology/index.html)  [Nursing](https://hls.iupui.edu/majors/nursing/index.html)  [Paramedic Science](https://hls.iupui.edu/majors/paramedic-science/index.html)  [Physical Education and Teacher Education](https://hls.iupui.edu/majors/physical-education-teacher-education/index.html)  [Public Health](https://hls.iupui.edu/majors/public-health/index.html)  [Radiation Therapy](https://hls.iupui.edu/majors/radiation-therapy/index.html)  [Radiography](https://hls.iupui.edu/majors/radiography/index.html)  [Respiratory Therapy](https://hls.iupui.edu/majors/respiratory-therapy/index.html)  Your cluster advisors and career consultant are here to help you succeed.

    "body": "  ## About the psychology major  Psychology is the scientific study of behavior and mental processes. The goals of psychology are to describe, explain, predict, and change behavior (observable actions) and mental processes (thoughts, feelings, beliefs, and memories) through research and applied knowledge. Overall, the goal of psychology is to improve the quality of life. Specialities of IUPUI psychology faculty include psychobiology of addictions, health psychology, industrial/organizational psychology, severe mental illness, stereotyping, and prejudice.  Skills and abilities this major develops: communication skills, critical thinking, understanding and appreciation of ethics and diversity, investigative and quantitative skills, and scientific methodology.   ### Engaged learning experiences  Regardless of your major or future career, engaged learning is vital to your present and future. It makes you more marketable for jobs and professional schools upon graduation, it enables you to build deeper connections with faculty and staff in your field of study, and it makes your learning personal by connecting your interests and values with the curriculum from your classes. Check out the three ideas below for places to get started, or learn more at IUPUI’s Institute for Engaged Learning website.

For thousands of years, people have turned to religious traditions to answer life’s most important questions. Yet only with the birth of modern research universities did scholars begin to study religion from an objective, nonsectarian perspective. The field of religious studies is dedicated to understanding the dimensions and patterns of religions across cultures and historical contexts. Students learn how religions shape individuals' views of the world; create and sustain the communities in which we live; and interact with politics, economics, literature and the arts, and other structures of society.   #### Degree map  One of the most difficult tasks of being a college student is figuring out what classes to take and when to take them.

    "body": "  ## About the management B.S.B. major  Management is the study of leadership for the day-to-day operations of a business as well as the future direction a business may go to continue its stated mission. You'll motivate employees, build teams, shape corporate cultures, allocate people and resources, and create strategies to improve operations and achieve business goals. You'll also study a broad range of business topics and specializations to gain a big picture understanding of the corporate world.  Skills and abilities this major develops : leadership, team-building, strategic planning, and resource allocation.   ### Engaged learning experiences  Regardless of your major or future career, engaged learning is vital to your present and future. It makes you more marketable for jobs and professional schools upon graduation, it enables you to build deeper connections with faculty and staff in your field of study, and it makes your learning personal by connecting your interests and values with the curriculum from your classes.

Having a strong support network is critical, especially when things get tough.  Biography: I was raised in a military family, growing up primarily overseas in Belgium, Japan, and Germany. I love to travel and save every penny I can to make it happen. When I’m not at work, I enjoy hiking, napping in hammocks, car singing, yoga, board games, and spending time with family and my two rambunctious rescue dogs, Putter and Daphne. My favorite things to learn about include almost anything related to history, culture, environmentalism, linguistics, and food. "

Interpreting for people who do not speak a common language is a linguistic and social act of communication. An interpreter relays messages and manages the process of talking back and forth for two people who speak different languages. An interpreter’s role is an engaged one, aimed at an overall understanding of the entire communicative situation, requiring fluency in the languages, the ability to know how meaning is constructed, and skills in managing the cross-cultural flow of talk.   #### Degree map  One of the most difficult tasks of being a college student is figuring out what classes to take and when to take them.

    "body": "  ## About the cybersecurity major  The cybersecurity major will prepare you to enter the workforce in the rapidly advancing field of cybersecurity. The Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity will enable you to address the security challenges and risks that all industries encounter daily. Cybersecurity is a multidisciplinary area—a combination of information technology, computing, and engineering.  This program will provide a solid, comprehensive background in the related topics of cybersecurity engineering and their applications. With more companies in all industries increasingly relying on technology for their operations, cybersecurity is a rapidly growing field.  Skills and abilities this major develops: problem solving, abstract thinking, malware analysis and reversing, risk analysis, risk mitigation, security data analytics, cloud security, and more.   ### Engaged learning experiences  Regardless of your major or future career, engaged learning is vital to your present and future. It makes you more marketable for jobs and professional schools upon graduation, it enables you to build deeper connections with faculty and staff in your field of study, and it makes your learning personal by connecting your interests and values with the curriculum from your classes. Check out the three ideas below for places to get started, or learn more at IUPUI’s Institute for Engaged Learning website.

About 19,500 openings for information security analysts are projected each year, on average, over the decade. Many of those openings are expected to result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force, such as retirement ( Occupational Outlook Handbook , 2022).   #### Salary information  According to the IUPUI First Destination Survey in 2021, the average starting salary for graduates from the School of Engineering and Technology with a bachelor's degree was $60,383, and the median was $60,320.  The national median annual salary for information security analysts was $102,600 in 2021 ( Occupational Outlook Handbook ).  (This section is intended for informational purposes, not prediction of actual salary.)   #### Graduate and professional school paths  Technological advances come rapidly in the computing field, so continued study is necessary to remain competitive.

    "body": "  ## Holds for University College students  University College academic advising holds will prevent you from registering for classes for the next term until you meet with your student success advisor. The purpose of these holds is to initiate a conversation between you and your advisor about your successful progress at IUPUI.  You should have holds on your record released before your enrollment date for the next term to ensure access to the most options for classes and times.   ### Types of advising holds   #### Advising (V03)  During their first semester at IUPUI, all new students are expected to meet and to discuss their plans for the next term with their student success advisor. The goal is to ensure you have the information and tools you need to successfully plan your education and to navigate IUPUI.  No enrollment is allowed in the next term until the hold is released.  To release the hold, you must make an appointment with one of the student success advisors in your cluster to discuss your transition to IUPUI, to review your academic and career goals, and to develop a plan for coursework in future semesters.  NOTE: If you are a freshman in a first-year seminar (FYS), the student success advisor in your FYS may provide you information about scheduling an appointment to clear the advising hold.  Details are emailed to your university email account when this hold has been added to your record.   #### Academic/transition (V06)  To ensure that all undergraduate students make appropriate progress toward completion of a degree, University College students who started at IUPUI as beginning freshmen are required to enter a degree-granting program by the time they earn 60 credit hours.  No enrollment is allowed in the next term until the hold is updated.  To release the hold, you must make an appointment with one of the student success advisors in your cluster to review your academic and career goals, to develop a plan for coursework in future semesters, and to develop a plan for admission to your degree-granting program.  Details are emailed to your university email account when this hold has been added to your record.  Once you are fully admitted to your degree-granting program, the hold will be fully removed.   #### Sophomore exploratory (V26)  To ensure timely progress toward completion of a degree, you should declare an intended major by the time you have completed 30 credit hours. If you are an exploratory major and have 30 or more credit hours, you will need to go through major and career exploration.  No enrollment is allowed in the next term until the hold is updated.  To release the hold, you must make an appointment with one of the exploratory student success advisors about major and career exploration.  Details are emailed to your university email account when this hold has been added to your record.   #### Academic probation (V00)  Students whose cumulative GPA is below a 2.0 are put on academic probation. We want you to be successful and are here to help in any way. We believe the probation program will help you achieve your educational goals.  No enrollment is allowed in the next term until the hold is updated.  To release the hold, you must make an appointment with one of the student success advisors in your cluster to review your academic and career goals, develop a plan for success for the current (and future) semesters, connect you with a mandatory mentoring program, and develop a course plan for future semesters.  Additional details are emailed to your university email account when this hold has been added to your record.   #### Dismissal (V02)  When your cumulative GPA fails to meet our retention standards, you'll be academically dismissed from University College. Students who have been dismissed from the university are not able to enroll in classes at IUPUI for at least the next fall or spring term following the academic dismissal.  No enrollment is allowed on any IU campus (multi-institutional).  Students must follow the procedures and petition for reinstatement. Details can be found under About, click on Policies, and then Academic Reinstatement.   #### Register one term only (V12)  Once reinstated after academic dismissal, you will be removed from the dismissal hold and added to the register-one-term-only hold. The goal is to ensure you have continued support in your return to IUPUI and to help you continue working on your plan for academic success.  No enrollment is allowed in the next term until the hold is updated.  Until you achieve good standing (a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or higher) or until you are admitted to your degree-granting program (whichever comes first), you are required to have an appointment with a student success advisor in your cluster each semester. At this appointment, you will review current academic progress and resources and develop a plan for the upcoming semester.   ### How to find a hold  A hold can be placed on your record for reasons including but not limited to: past due encumbrance (e.g., parking tickets, library fines, tuition payments), academic standards, failure to meet immunization requirements, required academic advising, missing admission credentials, or noncompliance with other university regulations or obligations.  A hold on your record can impact one or more of the following:  To check if a hold has been placed on your record, log into One and follow these steps:  [One](https://one.iu.edu/)  Depending on the type of hold, you may need to contact Academic and Career Development, the Health Life Sciences Advising Center, or even a different office.  All academic holds placed by University College require an advising appointment . "

In addition to studying the hospitality and travel industry, you'll also complete a general business certificate as part of the degree. Internships are required, and opportunities include both local and out-of-state sites.  Skills and abilities this major develops: event planning, management, marketing, communication, organization, and promotion.  Print page   ### Engaged learning experiences  Regardless of your major or future career, engaged learning is vital to your present and future. It makes you more marketable for jobs and professional schools upon graduation, it enables you to build deeper connections with faculty and staff in your field of study, and it makes your learning personal by connecting your interests and values with the curriculum from your classes.

Chemical biology applies logic and methods from chemistry to the study of complex and challenging questions in biology. To a significant extent, interest in chemical biology has been inspired by the growth of the biotechnology industry. Chemistry plays an integral role in today's scientific endeavors. As science has become increasingly interdisciplinary, fundamental scientific problems focus on the chemical nature of matter.   #### Degree map  One of the most difficult tasks of being a college student is figuring out what classes to take and when to take them.

Get involved on campus and join a club or organization. Do not be afraid to ask for help when you need it and offer it when you can give it.  Additionally, if your Plan A isn't what you thought it would be, don't be afraid to explore Plan B, C, or even D. Meet with your advisor or career consultant to explore options!  If you could be any major in your cluster, what would it be? Why?: I would study environmental science. I am fascinated with this degree because, as an avid gardener, I know how environmental issues affect every aspect of our being via what we consume. Being able to study how to prevent pollution and contamination and how to clean those areas already polluted is so very important and would be rewarding to me.  Biography: Although I was born in Brazil, Indiana, I have lived in many different places, from Pennsylvania to Kansas and most places in between! I just tell people I am from the country. Once we moved back to Indiana, I lived in a very rural setting on a small farm. I enjoy gardening . . . growing vegetables, flowers don’t stand a chance around me! I have a small nonprofit community garden. I love to “put up” (e.g., can, freeze, dehydrate) what I grow. I also enjoy spending weekends at our RV on the lake where the whole family can decompress and unplug. I am a wife, a mom to three daughters and one son, and a Grammy to one grandson and four granddaughters! Oh, I also have my baby, a La-Chon (Lhasa Apso-Bichon Frise mix) named Harold. "

    "body": "  ## Majors and careers for investigative interests   ### For abstract problem solvers  Majors and careers can be clustered into six broad interest areas that correspond to six different personality types. Based on the research of Dr. John Holland, this clustering system provides a preliminary way to identify undergraduate majors and careers that might be a satisfying fit for you. Because personality, majors, and careers are too complex to be described by a single interest theme, you will see that the lists below have a three-letter code to more accurately describe majors and careers using a combination of related interests (in order of importance). This “investigative” page reflects the interest cluster that ranks the “I” theme first, but be sure to review the other five clusters to see if any of those themes (R, A, S, E, C) are more descriptive of your interests.   ### Am I investigative?  Check off your interests, values, abilities, and qualities to find out.  These are characteristics of the investigative type. Investigative people are intellectual, abstract, analytical, independent, and task oriented. They like to observe, learn, investigate, analyze, evaluate, and solve problems.

Definitions of the above job titles can be found at O-NET OnLine . For additional investigative majors or careers, consult your academic advisor or a career counselor.  [O-NET OnLine](http://www.onetonline.org/)   ### Selecting an investigative major and career  Selecting a major and career is a very involved process, requiring careful evaluation of yourself as well as academic and occupational information. No single questionnaire, assessment, or person can tell you what you should pursue. In order to make the best choices, it is important to consider your unique combination of interests, values, abilities, personality, and experiences.  Keep in mind that majors and careers can accommodate a wide range of interests; an exact fit is not necessary for academic and career satisfaction. The majors and careers above are suggested only as starting points for your exploration. Specific major and career decisions can be discussed in more detail with your academic advisor or career counselor.   ### More information on careers and advising  [Schools, majors, and careers offered at IUPUI](https://www.iupui.edu/academics/schools.html)  Schools, majors, and careers offered at IUPUI  Check sheets for each IUPUI major  [Course descriptions for IUPUI](https://bulletins.iu.edu/iupui/)  Course descriptions for IUPUI  What can I do with a major I choose?

Overwhelmed? Deep breath. Confused? Deep breath. Walked across campus and made it to class in the nick of time with coffee? Deep breath.  If you could be any major in your cluster, what would it be? Why?: While I was an elementary education major, I was also a history minor, so I'd definitely choose that one. I have always loved ancient history, and that's what I specialized in while in college. Anything pre-history to about the early 1800s is my jam!  Biography: I am originally from Decatur Township here in Indianapolis, but I did live in Florida for about eight years before moving back here after college. I am currently a member of Naptown Roller Derby, as well as the Indianapolis Women's Chorus! I personally have six pets, including a Maine Coon mix, three snakes, and two leopard geckos. "

    "body": "  ## About the art education major  Herron’s art education programs prepare you to teach art in public and private schools, grades K–12. In the diverse settings of Indianapolis schools and museums, you'll learn the reflective practice of teaching young people of all backgrounds to create and to respond to art in today’s world. You'll examine the visual development of young people and construct learning environments where social imagination and visual literacy skills flourish. This major combines classes from Herron and the School of Education.  Skills and abilities this major develops : teaching, curriculum, writing, fine art skills, and cultural competency (Herron School of Art and Design, 2017).   ### Engaged learning experiences  Regardless of your major or future career, engaged learning is vital to your present and future. It makes you more marketable for jobs and professional schools upon graduation, it enables you to build deeper connections with faculty and staff in your field of study, and it makes your learning personal by connecting your interests and values with the curriculum from your classes. Check out the three ideas below for places to get started, or learn more at IUPUI’s Institute for Engaged Learning website.

About 77,900 openings for high school teachers are projected each year, on average, over the decade. Many of those openings are expected to result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force, such as retirement ( Occupational Outlook Handbook , 2022).   #### Salary information  According to the IUPUI First Destination Survey in 2021, the average starting salary for graduates from the School of Education was $41,859, and the median was $42,830.  The national median annual salary for high school teachers was $61,820 in 2021 ( Occupational Outlook Handbook ).
