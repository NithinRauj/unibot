Visiting Assistant Professor  [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauren-roberson-rd-ld-27298756/)   ### Biography  Lauren Roberson, Ph.D., R.D., L.D., is a Visiting Assistant Professor in Nutrition and Dietetics in the School of Health & Human Sciences. She is a Registered Dietitian whose research in malnutrition and food insecurity among community-dwelling older adults has led to the development of a nutrition education program for senior nutrition program participants.  Prior to beginning her appointment as faculty with the School of Health & Human Sciences, Roberson was the program director and assistant professor at Murray State University from 2020 to 2023. Before that appointment, Roberson served as a consultant dietitian with the Northern Kentucky Area Development District, Department of Aging and Independent Living. She also served as a research associate in the Nutrition Education Program under Cooperative Extension at the University of Kentucky.  In 2022, Roberson was the recipient of the Outstanding Dietetic Educator Award, North Central Region, Graduate Program, presented by the Nutrition and Dietetics Educators and Preceptors practice group. Likewise, Roberson was named the School of Nursing and Health Professions' Collegiate Researcher in the same year. Roberson graduated from the University of Kentucky with a B.S. in dietetics in 2012, a M.S. in dietetic administration in 2014, and received her Ph.D. in health and strategic communication in 2020.   ### Research  Roberson focuses on improving nutrition education for older adults participating in state-operated Senior Nutrition Programming, as mandated by the Older Americans Act. More specifically, Roberson has collected fomative data that led to the development of a 12-unit educational curriculum. A feasibility and acceptability study was conducted in order to determine interest (Roberson et al., 2023). Results showed perceived increases in ability to read nutrition fact labels and identify health food choices. The greatest accolade was initiation of conversation surrounding health food choices and the impact of diet on quality of life. Plans are underway to refine the curriculum, digitize it, and develop a facilitator guidebook and training for those on the ground to implement it. Additionally, there are efforts to secure federal funding to pilot-test the curriculum over a 12-month period with follow-up data collection, with the intention for it to be incorporated in standard operating procedures for aging departments statewide and nationally.  Roberson has also presented on the topic of malnutrition risk in community-dwelling older adults at the Kentucky Department of Aging at the Independent Living and the State Health Insurance Assistance Program Aging conference in 2023.  Other areas of research interest include diet patterns and nutrition knowledge of collegiate athletes, reminder interventions to promote euhydration in middle-aged obese women, and common lifestyle factors associated with longevity, including diet and exercise. Roberson is also interested in the efficacy of storytelling and narrative in provision of nutrition education. Along a similar thread, she is also interested in exploring the quality of interactions between R.D.s and patients using the multiple goals theory and communication quality analysis.  As president-elect for the Kentucky Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, Roberson's mission is to advocate for the profession, ensuring that R.D.'s are perceived as the food and nutrition experts. In addition, a secondary goal is to empower future leaders in nutrition and dietetics in Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, and beyond.

    "body": "  ## Physical education teacher education student teaching experience   ### How it works  Student teaching is a full-time, final semester experience. It is the last class teacher education students take prior to graduation. It will help you understand what level of classroom you prefer to teach. It also gives you an opportunity to practice your knowledge, skills, and abilities. Often, the experience results in a full-time job offer.  As a student teacher, you will will be assigned to an elementary-level eight-week rotation, followed by a middle, junior, or high school eight-week term. The first few days of each, you will observe the teaching mentor. Next, you will have time to practice as a co-teacher. Soon after, you will teach as the lead. You will follow the school’s calendar where you are placed, not IU Indianapolis. You also may have opportunities for coaching or before-and-after-school activities.   ### Where you will teach  The most common sites are Indianapolis Public Schools and the surrounding Indianapolis township school corporations. Thanks to early planning and partnership with the program chair, some students have completed student teaching beyond Indiana’s borders.  Site selection is through the IU Indianapolis School of Education. When it’s your time for student teaching, you will complete an application process that helps determine your placement. Faculty will guide you through the process.   ### What you will learn  Takeaways from this experience include classroom management, instructional design, teaching strategies, adaptive instruction, and more. Throughout the semester, you’ll become adept at assessing student learning, providing feedback, and utilizing active-learning techniques. You’ll also begin to develop your own teaching style and philosophy.   ### Program results  You’ll find yourself ready for career success after completing this ultimate step in your undergraduate journey. Physical education teachers from our program experience a high rate of employment and job satisfaction, a testament to the work you will put in—along with SHHS faculty—to get you through the student teaching semester and celebrate your graduation.

After graduation, y ou will be ready to take the national certifying exam necessary to become a certified OT and have the competencies and skills to practice in the field.   ### Our mission  The mission of the IU Indianapolis occupational therapy entry-level clinical doctorate program is to prepare future occupational therapy leaders to address the occupational needs of a diverse society and to promote health and well-being by facilitating participation in life roles, everyday activities, and community living.  The IUPUI entry-level OTD program strives to reflect current and emergent occupational therapy practice by placing equal value on rehabilitative, community-based, and role emerging areas of practice. Towards that end the curriculum design embodies AOTA Vision 2025 while also addressing healthcare quality core competencies for health professionals set forth by the Institute of Medicine ([IOM] 2003).   ### AOTA Vision 2025  As an inclusive profession, occupational therapy maximizes health, well-being, and quality of life for all people, populations, and communities through effective solutions that facilitate participation in everyday living.  The IOM core competencies for health professionals include client-centered care, work in interdisciplinary teams, evidence-based practice, and data driven decision making (quality improvement and informatics). Finally, providing trauma informed care is now the expectation, not the exception, in behavioral health systems and primary care settings (National Council for Behavioral Health, 2020). For this reason, the entry-level OTD curriculum prepares students to develop the knowledge, attitudes, values, and skills needed for successful practice as competent, contemporary, trauma informed entry-level therapists.

    "body": "  ## Get the answers you’re looking for about the IU MPAS program  Have questions about the MPAS program at Indiana University? Browse the FAQs to find answers to common questions.   ### General   #### Do you offer tours of the MPAS facilities?  Yes. We offer individual tours of the program facilities. Contact hprofadv@iu.edu to arrange a building tour.   #### What is the physician assistant studies class size?  We enroll 44 new students per year.   #### When does the program start?  Students begin in the summer term. Typically, the first day is the second or third Monday in May.   #### How long is the program?  The PA program is 27 months. Students begin in May and graduate two years later in August.   #### Can I work while I’m in the program?  Due to the intensity and academic rigor of the program, the IU MPAS department strongly recommends that students do not work while in the program. Students are required to be available for class meetings from 8 a.m.–5 p.m., Monday through Friday. Additional individual and group study time outside of class are also required.   ### Application Process   #### Do you give preference to Indiana residents?  No. The MPAS admissions committee does not give preference to any applicant type.   #### What should I major in for undergrad/does it matter what I major in for undergrad?  The IU MPAS admissions committee does not give preference to any undergraduate major and accepts an undergraduate degree in any major from a regionally accredited institution.   #### Can I apply if my cumulative GPA is below a 3.2? / Can I apply if my overall science GPA is below a 3.2? / Is there special emphasis given to the last 60 credit hours of a baccalaureate degree?  Applicants are not eligible for admission if they do not meet our minimum requirements, which includes a 3.2 cumulative GPA and a 3.2 overall science GPA. We do not give special consideration to the last 60 credit hours. All college coursework is factored into the cumulative GPA.   #### How can I become a competitive applicant?  The most competitive applicants will likely be those who surpass the minimum academic requirements, have a clear understanding of the PA profession, demonstrate professionalism, leadership, community service, and are a good match to the program vision, mission, and values .   #### How many shadowing hours or patient contact hours should I get?  The program requires patient contact hours, though there are no minimum hour requirements. These hours may be paid, volunteer, or shadowing experiences. The purpose of accruing patient contact hours is to ensure the applicant has adequate exposure to the health-care system, patients, and the role of a PA. All patient contact hours are accepted. Applicants need to address how their patient contact hours have prepared them for PA school in their personal statement. There is no ideal number of patient contact hours that applicants need to be most competitive. This requirement is just one part of the holistic admissions review.   ### Prerequisite Coursework   #### Do you accept prerequisite coursework from Ivy Tech or another community college?  Yes. The MPAS admissions committee accepts coursework from any regionally accredited institution.   ### Admission Interviews   #### How many students are invited to interview and what is the interview format?  The number of students invited to interview changes each cycle. Due to the volume of applicants, the admissions committee is unable to provide personalized feedback to each applicant based on their interview performance.   ### Financial Aid and Tuition   #### Are there any scholarship opportunities or graduate assistantships?  At this time, we also have an admission-based scholarship for incoming students. The recipient and dollar amount are determined by the admissions committee and awarded to an incoming student. There is no application for this scholarship. For students looking for financial aid, we encourage you to fill out the FAFSA. Most students utilize federal student loans.  Review school scholarships  No graduate assistantships are available for the IU MPAS program. "

Durante el momento en que está celebrando la próxima graduación de la escuela secundaria de su hijo o hija, es probable que también esté tratando de investigar las escuelas y las opciones para su futuro. Mi ciudad natal es Ponce, Puerto Rico. Me crie hablando español como mi idioma natal, pero soy bilingüe. Sé que buscar información en nuestro idioma nativo puede ser difícil. He sido Decano de la Facultad de Salud y Ciencias Humanas durante más de seis años y llevo en IUPUI 28 años. Como estudiante universitario, hice mi bachillerato en DePauw University, la maestría en Indiana State University, y el doctorado en Indiana University. Mi carrera académica me ha dado experiencias con universidades pequeñas, grandes, privadas, públicas, rurales, urbanas, y por supuesto nuestro campus de IU Indianapolis. Puede que sea un poco parcial, pero creo que IU Indianapolis, es el mejor de los campus!  Antes de ser decano yo fui director del programa de investigación de académicos de diversidad en IU Indianapolis y soy el director del programa de NIH IPREP (programa de educación de investigación posterior al bachillerato para estudiantes de minorías). Gran parte de mi trabajo en IU Indianapolis ha sido dedicado a aumentar la participación de estudiantes minoritarios en ciencia, tecnología, educación, y matemáticas. Quería que supieras esto sobre mí, pero también quiero que sepas que, ante todo, estoy aquí para ayudar a tu hijo o hija a tener éxito. Los estudiantes que representan a las comunidades hispanas y latinas son bienvenidos en IU Indianapolis. Pueden vivir en nuestros dormitorios, fuera del campus en un apartamento, o desde su casa. Hay una variedad de clubes y actividades para garantizar que su estudiante disfrute de una vida universitaria. Lo más importante es que si su estudiante viene aquí, tendrá muchas oportunidades para desarrollar varias carreras en un ambiente que empodera a los estudiantes y celebra la diversidad. La Asociación de Estudiantes Latinos abraza nuestra herencia y fomenta la comprensión en todo el campus de nuestros valores y las muchas culturas que representamos colectivamente. Yo, como decano de una escuela, pero también como padre de estudiantes universitarios, quiero asegurarme de que promuevo una comunidad de aprendizaje donde su hijo sea bienvenido, pueda tener éxito y pertenezca. En términos de programas de bachillerato, nuestra escuela ofrece títulos en gestión de deportes y eventos, ayudando a los estudiantes a aprender a organizar mega eventos y convenciones deportivas. Enseñamos la ciencia del ejercicio, así como ciencias de la salud, para que los estudiantes puedan convertirse en futuros proveedores de atención médica clínica como terapeuta físico e investigadores ocupacionales del deporte y ejercicio, entrenadores de salud, y más. También preparamos a los estudiantes para ser maestros de  educación física y convertirse en entrenadores de deportes. En cuanto a nuestros programas de posgrado y profesionales, ofrecemos títulos avanzados en ciencias de la salud y el ejercicio, nutrición y dietética, así como turismo de eventos, lo que lleva a las personas a convertirse en investigadores o profesionales mejor calificados. Tenemos programas profesionales que capacitan a asistentes médicos y terapeutas físicos y ocupacionales. Si tiene alguna pregunta sobre los programas y servicios ofrecidos en nuestra escuela, comuníquese con nosotros. Me encantaría mostrarle el campus y hablar sobre el tipo de educación que su estudiante recibiría en nuestra escuela, lo que pueden estudiar y los tipos de carreras que pueden obtener después de la graduación. Como decano y padre, creo que la educación abre posibilidades y transforma vidas para nuestros hijos, nuestros nietos y nuestro futuro colectivo. Espero que consideren mi invitación a visitar. La mejor de las suertes para usted y su estudiante mientras explora su futuro.  Rafael Bahamonde   ### Aprende más  [Aplica a la IUPUI](https://indianapolis.iu.edu/admissions/apply/index.html) "

I mean, they did not hold me back. If there were days that Dr. Swinford knew she wasn't going to be there, she didn't ask another professor to come in and sub. It was on me. So, I remember very early on being asked, like, 'Hey, can you do this lecture for me on this day?' And I remember getting so hot and being so nervous about that, but I have almost a hundred students now. I lecture five days a week and I definitely wouldn't have the confidence that I have without those experiences that were offered to me during my grad program.\"  Indiana University Indianapolis School of Health & Human Sciences logo fades in with the url go.iu.edu/msk.

All exercise science and fitness management and personal training majors participate in internships through the department. Physical education teacher education majors will work through the School of Education for student teaching experience.  All you have to do to get started is to review the course requirements and confirm prerequisites with the help of your degree map at one.iu.edu.   ### Internship course intent forms   #### Internal internship  An internal internship provides an exercise science intern experience within SHHS (KINE-P 443)   #### External internship  External internships available from professional practice programs course (KINE-P 393)   ### Internship course requirements   #### KINE-P 393 internship prerequisites  If you are on an exercise science or fitness management and personal training plan of study, you must complete all prerequisite courses listed below with a grade of C or better.  Exercise science majors are required to complete:  Fitness management & personal training majors are required to complete:  You need to have met all prerequisite requirements listed to take KINE-P 393.   #### Internship grade requirements  KINE-P 443 is a graded class; you must obtain C or higher to continue with KINE-P 393.  KINE-P 393 is a seven credit S/F course, meaning you earn either a satisfactory or a fail grade. If you pass the course, your grade point average is not affected. If you fail the course, your grade point average will be negatively impacted.  The internship director awards the grade, not the site supervisor.  The grading criteria includes your performance on the quality of your portfolio, on ratings you receive from your site supervisor on two formal evaluations, on how well you follow timelines for submitting various assignments, and whether or not you did submit all materials.   #### Additional assignments during KINE-P 393  Within the first two weeks, there will be some informational forms and professional goals due at the start of the semester. You will also be required to develop a portfolio, which will be worked on both at your internship site and during time outside your regular internship hours. There will be a portfolio discussion and a one-hour exit interview with the director at the conclusion of your internship. There will also be a mid-term and final evaluations.  Additionally, you will need to check Canvas frequently for emails and announcements related to your internship course. The internship director will make at least one visit or phone call interview during your internship. A second visit or phone call will happen only if necessary.   #### Take classes during your internship  You may take a maximum of six credit hours. You should devote most of your energy to top-notch performance in your internship.  For the KINE-P 443 class, you may take as many credit hours as needed to maintain your normal academic load.   #### Check-ins during the internship experience  The director will be contacting you regularly–by email, Canvas, or by phone–throughout your internship experience to check in.  Go to the Canvas site weekly for general announcements, updates, and more. There will be specific times when you are to required to connect with the director, such as the second week to send goal statements, coordinate the director’s visits to your site, and during internship evaluations for the mid-term and final evaluation.   ### Internship course registration   #### How to register  If you’re looking to register for KINE-P 443, make sure you’ve met with your academic advisor and confirmed all the required prerequisites.

For this external internship course, you must also complete the application and onboarding processes that are required by your internship site.   #### When to submit the internship course intent form  For the best chance of placement in the internship course, be sure to check SHHS Undergraduate E-News each semester for the priority consideration dates. Generally, the recommendation is the submit the forms following this schedule:  If you miss the priority consideration date, complete the form as soon as possible or contact the internship director immediately to discuss your situation. The longer you wait, the more limited your options will be.   ### Internship site selection   #### When and how to investigate prospective internship sites  You can start exploring internship opportunities a year before doing your intended internship. You do not need permission to investigate or visit a prospective site. You are in a fact-finding or information-gathering phase regarding your internship. Inform prospective internship sites that you will need to be declared eligible and your internship form approved by the internship director before you will be authorized to accept a position at a potential host site for internship credit.  The department maintains a directory of approved sites also known as the DAS. The DAS consists of organizations that have hosted a kinesiology intern in the past or have expressed an interest in hosting a kinesiology intern in the future.  If you find a promising site not on in the DAS, check out the details, and email kineint@iupui.edu to discuss your findings. Additional sites may be added to the DAS depending on the location of the potential site and the site’s ability to provide a quality experience for student interns. However, do not assume that you are automatically permitted to do an internship at a site that is not in the DAS.  Consult with the internship director to help narrow your search in finding an internship suitable for your long-term goals.   #### Why do sites need to be approved and put in the directory of approved sites?  The department maintains the DAS as a way of making sure that the sites are clear about what we expect of interns. It also ensures that they can provide adequate supervision for students. For instance, the site supervisor should have a degree in a related area and proper certifications, as well as be willing to mentor the student intern.  Potential sites out of the Indianapolis area are much less likely to be approved because of limited resources the department has for supervising you as an intern.   #### What to look for when investigating potential sites  You are looking for a site or sites that suit your needs, goals, and interests. The better research you do ahead of time, the more likely you are to locate a site that meets your expectations for the internship experience.  Criteria you should consider:   #### Can I do my internship where I currently work?  Probably not, but check with the internship director about a possible exception. However, keep in mind the point of doing an internship is to learn new things and new ways of doing things. This is more difficult to achieve at a place you’re familiar with from working at since you know their ways and techniques.   #### Internships at sites not on the department directory  You should not move forward with the internship if you want it to count toward your internship credit for KINE-P 393. Contact the internship director to discuss your interest in a site not currently on the DAS.  Before you contact the director, you should gather specific information about the site including the internship contact person, the name of the organization, address, phone, fax, website address, email, and potential duties of an intern.  The director is responsible for contacting potential sites, checking to see if that site hosts interns, and requesting that the supervisor submits an internship host site application with the department.   #### When to apply to an internship site  Each internship site has its own set of deadlines and procedures for internships. You will need to determine the deadlines of the sites you are interested in. Be responsible for getting your materials in on time. Some sites set deadlines as early as 12 months or more in advance, others will take applications very close to the start date, and many sites have deadlines somewhere in between. Let the internship director know if your selected site has an earlier deadline than the internship programs require.   #### Determine if you need liability insurance  When you are discussing internship possibilities with prospective internship sites, ask whether the site requires it and then ask if they provide it or expect you to provide your own coverage. Some internship sites provide interns with liability insurance coverage; others do not. In some instances, sites may require that you show proof of liability insurance coverage before you will be allowed to start your internship.  The internship director maintains a list of inexpensive liability insurance options. If you’re needing liability insurance check with the director to explore potential sources of coverage.   ### Internship hours and duration   #### Hours and scheduling  Discuss the schedule expectations when you interview. Find out what hours the site will require and consider if that will work for you.  A site may ask you to work a split shift (e.g., Tuesday–Saturday from 5:30–9 a.m. and 4:30–8 p.m. or 8 a.m.–3 p.m. weekdays plus every other Saturday). Consider if the schedule will work for you and discuss it with the site before you accept the position.   #### Start dates  This depends on when your internship site needs and expects you to start. And, it depends on how flexible that site is in accommodating commitments in your schedule.  Ask about the potential start date when you interview at the site to find out the expected starting and ending dates. As far as the department is concerned, you may start as soon as the previous semester or summer session ends. We do not want anything to interfere with your present academic work and responsibility. Any exceptions to this timing must be cleared by the internship director.   #### Internship length  The minimum requirement is 350 hours for those taking the KINE-P 393 for seven credit hours. Some host sites may have internships that last longer. You will need to decide if you are willing to accept an internship that is longer than required by your plan of study.  There are several ways to configure those 350 hours. It depends on what the host site needs or expects and what you and the site supervisor negotiate at the onset. Some sites have very fixed daily and weekly schedules, while others will accommodate your schedule to some extent.  Discuss the options before you accept an internship offer. The department does not care that you finish earlier than the time frame of a regular semester. The goal is to accomplish an internship in as much a full-time capacity as possible.   #### Working another job during the internship  Even if the internship is not paid, it must consist of 350 hours for the seven credit hour internship course. We ask that you devote a majority of your time to the internship and work only a few additional hours a week at another job.  We advise students in the kinesiology department that an internship is a requirement. You should plan ahead so that the internship fits into your schedule and financial plan.   #### Holidays and vacations  The department expects interns to follow the schedule of your internship site. Be sure to talk with your internship supervisor during your interview or the first week of your internship if you want to discuss options for holidays or days off.   #### Working extra hours at my internship site to earn money  Many sites provide this option. Inquire about opportunities during your initial interview or shortly thereafter. Jobs range from covering the front desk, working with personal training clients, or staffing special events.  Keep in mind that you need to be rested, sharp, and effective during your internship hours. Avoid working too many extra income producing hours that you compromise your internship performance.  With my Ascension internship, I have been given many amazing opportunities to see Phase 1 through Phase 3 cardiac rehab as well as stress testing and seeing the cath lab. It's been great to have hands-on experiences I can take with me to any work environment.   ### Have any questions? Reach out to learn more! "

    "body": "  # Tracy Dierks Ph.D.  Associate Professor  [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dierks-tracy/)  [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/)   ## Biography  Tracy A. Dierks, Ph.D., is an associate professor in the physical therapy program. He also holds an appointment with St. Vincent Sports Performance Science.  His area of expertise is biomechanics, specifically gait (running, walking) and exercise-related injuries and performance, as well as exercise science and health promotion. Dierks has made significant research contributions to the area of running injuries, especially in the etiology and development of interventions for patellofemoral pain in runners.  He is also a founding member of St. Vincent Sports Performance Science, where he has made significant research contributions in the areas of injury screening and performance training in athletes.  Courses taught within the department include biomechanics, advanced therapeutic exercise, health promotions, and evidence-based practice.  Dierks graduated from the University of Nebraska at Omaha with a B.S. in 1999 and an M.S. in exercise science in 2001. He earned a Ph.D. in biomechanics and movement science from the University of Delaware in 2005.  Dierks is the director of the motion analysis research laboratory affiliated with IU's physical therapy program and St. Vincent Sports Performance Science, located in the new Indiana Pacers practice facility in downtown Indianapolis. His research is primarily focused on the biomechanics of gait and exercise- and sport-related movements associated with injury and performance. His most extensive work in this area involves the mechanisms contributing to lower extremity running injuries, and the development of intervention and rehabilitation programs for running injuries, especially for patellofemoral pain syndrome.  Dierks has several publications and presentations on this work, which includes the investigation of running mechanics in both healthy and injured runners, and in the development of interventions involving muscle strengthening of the legs and core, dynamic alignment training, shoe wear, and anti-gravity treadmill training, to name a few.  He is especially interested in how variability and fatigue are related to running injuries and performance. His most recent work involves a collaboration with the Department of Kinesiology at IU Bloomington in the development of a multi-site prospective study aimed at identifying risk factors related to running injuries.  Other related work includes pre-participation screening in athletes to assess injury risk and aid in return-to-play decisions, as well as interdisciplinary training to improve athlete skills and physical attributes. More recently, he has made significant contributions in the use of anti-gravity treadmill training to improve running performance.  Dierks has also made significant contributions to research involving gait and biomechanics in physical activity and rehabilitation outside of the athlete setting. Some of this research includes how chronic stroke influences walking gait mechanics and endurance, and how rehabilitation programs involving yoga-based exercise aid in recovery of gait.  Dierks is also a founding member of the robotics laboratory in the Indiana Center for Advanced Neurorehabilitation, where several studies have been conducted related to the effects of robot-assisted training in rehabilitation programs for children with cerebral palsy. More recently, he is involved in a collaboration with the occupational therapy department working to develop an intervention program aimed at increasing functional gains from exercise in older adults who are at risk of developing disabilities related to activities of daily living.

Our commitment to diversity and inclusion is integral to our institution’s overarching mission to serve its students and community as an exemplary center of education and scholarly inquiry. We believe that the greater inclusion of backgrounds and diversity in perspectives enriches the education our students receive and the climate in which they pursue it, and improves their ability to succeed as citizens, professionals, and leaders in an increasingly global society.  Additionally, attention to issues of diversity and inclusion supports and promotes the meaningful research, service, and community engagement pursued by the SHHS faculty and staff. The following goals, strategies and performance indicators are designed to drive action towards the overarching goal of a more diverse and inclusive climate for our students, faculty, and staff. This strategic plan was developed over a period of 18 months in 2019–2020 by the inaugural SHHS diversity, equity, and inclusion committee (DEI). Committee members included faculty, staff, and student stakeholders from multiple graduate and undergraduate programs within SHHS. A 2019 school culture and climate survey, as well as general strategic planning priorities formulated within the newly created SHHS, formed the foundation for the strategic goals. A draft plan was presented to faculty and staff for input and approval in August of 2020. This DEI strategic plan was formatted according to Smith’s Diversity Framework, and it was finalized and adopted in late fall of 2020.   ### Developed by members of the first SHHS DEI committee  Valerie Strunk, PT, DPT (chair)  Elizabeth Cohen, M.S.

    "body": "  ## Apply what you learn  Gain valuable work experience, identify career opportunities, and network with professionals in your future field as you apply what you learn in the classroom in the real world.  The internship course is designed to provide you with hands-on industry experience. It will complement your undergraduate education and advance you toward earning your degree.  [Check course prerequisites Review the course requirements and confirm prerequisites with the help of your degree map](https://sisjee.iu.edu/sisigps-prd/web/igps/dm/public/maps/view?mapId=d28224f2-1540-4105-ad63-1749805cc0a5&_gl)   ### Check course prerequisites  Review the course requirements and confirm prerequisites with the help of your degree map   ### Health Sciences internship intent form  Use the intent form when you’re ready to complete your internship course requirement for health sciences   ### Getting registered   #### Requirements to enroll in the HLSC-H 495 internship course  To enroll in the health sciences internship course, students must meet the following requirements.  *Students who started in the program before 2019 can take the internship course as an elective. Those who enrolled in or after 2019 are required to take the six-credit-hour internship.   #### Steps to register   #### When to submit the internship consent form  The course sequence is to take HLSC-H 475—the senior capstone course—the semester before you take the internship. Completing the consent form and acquiring an internship will take place during the capstone course.  If you previously took HLSC-H 300 (career development) you need to complete the consent form by the first week of October for a spring internship or the first week of March for a summer or fall internship.   #### When capstone and internship courses are offered  The internship course is offered every semester. However, the capstone course is only offered during the fall and spring semesters. Students wanting to take the internship in summer or fall would take the capstone course the previous spring. Students must take the two in sequence, and the capstone course precedes the internship.   #### When to start exploring internship opportunities  We encourage students to begin thinking about a potential internship during their freshman year. This is based on your interests, employment opportunities, networking events, meetings with faculty, or perhaps even talking to friends and family! One can never tell when knowing someone, working at a health facility, or meeting someone during an event might lead to an opportunity down the road. These chance meetings may lead to an internship opportunity in your senior year.  The actual solidifying of an internship should occur the semester before you plan on interning. One of the goals of the HLSC-H 475 capstone course is to obtain an internship.   ### About the course   #### What to expect during the internship  The goal of the internship is for students to explore or gain experience in their chosen careers. Students are asked to develop objectives they wish to achieve during the internship that will help them grow and progress toward their career goals. This is not only an opportunity to learn but to apply the skills learned during the past several years in the health sciences degree program. If you are still determining a career in the health-care system, the internship will give you the opportunity to explore possible career options.   #### Internship grade requirements  HLSC-H 495 is a six-credit-hour course for which we use an A through F grading scale. This is implemented primarily to ensure students submit appropriate documentation and reflections for the internship. As with all health sciences courses, students must earn a C or above to pass.  The internship is split between two primary responsibilities:  As you can see, assignments are focused on the internship itself as opposed to curricular assignments.   #### Hours and scheduling  Each internship site has unique responsibilities, hours, and duties. You will need to discuss your potential hours with your site preceptor, as well as your internship instructor. Since you are a student and this is a credit-based course, excessive hours will not be approved. In other words, 12-hour days are not acceptable. Occasional ten-hour shifts may be approved based on the organization’s characteristics but eight-hour days should be the maximum. In addition, seven-day work weeks are not permissible.   #### Communicate with your instructor during the internship  The instructor will be in contact during the semester to check in, obtain updates, or provide information. Make sure to check Canvas regularly, as well as check your IU email, to keep up to date.   #### Internship project requirements  The internship project is an opportunity for students to develop and implement a project of their choosing. Although you are encouraged to work with your internship site preceptor to choose a project, the responsibility and leadership of the project should be your primary responsibility.  The project information must be clearly articulated when submitting the internship consent form. However, based on the internship site and organization, the project may change once the internship begins. Should this happen, communicate with your instructor your intent to change and provide clear documentation of what your new project will entail. Once the instructor approves the new project, you may begin the implementation.  A detailed reflection and summary of the project will make up 25 percent of your final grade.   #### Examples of possible projects  The project is unique for each internship. The project will differ depending on student creativity and supervisor input. Ideas for projects include, but are not limited to:   #### Start and ends dates for internships  The first day of the internship cannot be any earlier than the semester start date. Students must complete 300 hours, which is very feasible during a 16-week semester time frame. Should circumstances prevent the completion of the 300 hours in a semester, an incomplete may be given to allow students time to complete the internship. However, this must be discussed with the instructor and is based on extenuating circumstances.  Although you cannot begin your internship early, you can finish the internship earlier than the semester end date. We encourage students to complete the internship in a full-time capacity, which means you could complete all 300 hours in eight weeks, based on a 40-hour work week. Make sure to communicate your intent with your instructor.   #### Holidays and vacations  Since you are an intern at another organization, you need to follow the organization’s holiday schedule. If you are planning to take time during the semester (i.e., spring break), this must be clearly communicated to the internship site prior to starting the internship. You will also need to calculate the missed time into your internship schedule. Not having enough hours at the end of the semester, after taking a week off, does not warrant an incomplete for the internship.   #### Determine if you need liability insurance  When you are discussing internship possibilities with prospective internship sites, ask whether the site requires it and then ask if they provide it or expect you to provide your own coverage. Some internship sites provide interns with liability insurance coverage; others do not. In some instances, sites may require that you show proof of liability insurance coverage before you will be allowed to start your internship.  If you need liability insurance, contact your instructor for information on inexpensive liability insurance options.  My internship with IU School of Medicine helped me develop my academic and clinical research skillsets.   ### Have any questions? Reach out to learn more! "

    "body": "  ## Application requirements and steps for the Master of Physician Assistant Studies (MPAS) degree  The requirements, deadlines, and process for applying for the Master of Physician Assistant Studies (MPAS) program are outlined below. As a potential applicant, you should review this admissions information before you apply.   ### Eligibility requirements  The program utilizes a holistic admissions process. To be eligible to apply for the MPAS program, you need to meet the following requirements.   #### View all prerequisites  *For combined Human Anatomy & Physiology classes, a two-course sequence—two semesters or one full year—at a 200 level or higher is recommended.  All courses, except for Medical Terminology, must be at least three credit hours. Online courses are accepted for science courses with labs, though in-person labs are recommended. Read the prerequisite course descriptions to make sure your prerequisites are a suitable match.  At the time of application, you may have one, yet-to-be-completed course. This outstanding course must be finished before starting the program. The IU MPAS prerequisite courses do not have an expiration date.  Online courses and labs are accepted for prerequisite requirements.   #### Prerequisite grade requirements  The required courses must be completed with a grade of C or higher. In some cases, an official course description or syllabus may be requested to ensure the course you completed aligns with the required MPAS prerequisites. If you have an outstanding prerequisite course, it too must be completed with a grade of C or higher. A final transcript indicating successful completion of the prerequisite is required prior to matriculation into the program.   #### Credits and transfers  The MPAS admissions committee accepts coursework from any regionally accredited institution.  Transfer credits are not accepted. Applicants should be aware that all courses in the program curriculum are required. There is not an option for the curriculum to be accelerated.   #### Retaking a prerequisite course  Prerequisites can be retaken. However, all attempts at prerequisite courses will be factored into the GPA calculations.  [CASPA’s course subject list](https://help.liaisonedu.com/CASPA_Applicant_Help_Center/Filling_Out_Your_CASPA_Application/2._CASPA_Academic_History/4CASPA_Course_Subjects)     #### Learn more about the patient care requirement   #### Observation  The applicant/physician assistant student must be able to participate actively in all demonstrations and laboratory exercises in the basic medical sciences and to assess and comprehend the condition of all patients assigned to him or her for examination, diagnosis, and treatment. Such observation and information acquisition usually requires the functional use of visual, auditory, and somatic sensation.   #### Communication  The applicant/physician assistant student must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively with patients in order to elicit information, describe changes in mood, activity and posture, assess non-verbal communications, and be able to effectively and efficiently transmit information to patients, fellow students, faculty, staff and all members of the health-care team.

Problem-solving, the critical skill demanded of physician assistants, requires all of these intellectual abilities. In addition, the applicant/physician assistant student must be able to comprehend three-dimensional relationships and to understand the spatial relationships of structures. The applicant/physician assistant student must have the capacity to perform these problem-solving skills in a timely fashion.   #### Behavioral and social attributes  The applicant/physician assistant student must possess the emotional health required for full utilization of his or her intellectual abilities, the exercise of good judgment, the prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the diagnosis and care of patients, and the development of mature, sensitive and effective relationships with patients and others. They must also be able to tolerate taxing workloads, function effectively under stress, adapt to a changing environment, display flexibility, and learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in the clinical problems of many patients. Compassion, integrity, concern for others, commitment, and motivation are personal qualities that each applicant/physician assistant student should possess.  The most competitive applicants will likely be those that surpass the minimum academic requirements, have a clear understanding of the physician assistant profession, demonstrate professionalism, leadership, and community service, and support the vision, mission, and values set out by the program.

    "body": "  ## Limited Mobility. Unlimited Ability.  Skills on Wheels is an evidence-based training program designed to help kids maneuver life situations in their wheelchairs. Trained professionals from Riley Hospital for Children partner with occupational therapy and physical therapy students from IU to serve children between 8 and 17 years of age who are manual wheelchair users regardless of diagnosis.  Skills on Wheels teaches essential wheelchair skills to wheelchair-using children. The program first teaches basic skills, like rolling forward, backward or taking apart your chair. Participants build up to intermediate and advanced skills, such as navigating street curbs.  [Meet our research students](https://blogs.iu.edu/skillsonwheels/research-students/)  Meet our research students  [Learn about our funders](https://blogs.iu.edu/skillsonwheels/funders/)  Learn about our funders  Description of the video:  Anna Catahay: When I was pregnant with Miana, I went into your routine ultrasound, and then they had noticed there was something going on as far as the hydrocephalus. So she has spina bifida with hydrocephalus, she has a Chiari II malformation, neurogenic bladder, so there's a lot of things that are going on. We don't know anybody where we're from that has spina bifida. It was a new world for us. I mean we've been really blessed with just how our lives have kind of unfolded. Despite her challenges, she's really been able to get out there and do things from Girl Scouts to — she loves theater. She's very comfortable in her own skin. In the past, it's, \"Okay, can she have an IA at the school, someone that's going to be around her?\" But she's getting at the age where she's like, \"Mom, I don't want someone hovering over me all day.\" So her being able to even just do that simple skill — getting over like a little bump — I'm not so worried or concerned about having someone right next to her to make sure she gets over it, or that she's going to tip over.  Jonathan Catahay: Because of the program, her confidence level to even attempt to do certain things that — she just turned 11-year-old a few days ago, and up until the time before we came to this program, we never really attempted to do a wheelie or to remove her anti-tippers and let her try to get over a curb, and she was always afraid. She wouldn't try it, but because of this, and the people that are working with her, very encouraging, she's got a lot more courage to try and do things. And her actual skills — we could be out and about, and there's a bump or a crack in the pavement that normally would stop her dead in her tracks, but she's just zooming right over it, doing a little hop over it.  Anna: After I think a couple of sessions, I was literally chasing after her because she was going, and then she would do her little wheelie and then get over that crack in the sidewalk, and it was an amazing feeling. It was really really awesome.  Jonathan: Even just going through the exercises, she may not master it now, but it's something that we can build on or continue to practice at home. I think I would say if you ask me what's the most important thing take-away from this, it's her mindset — the way she thinks about things now, problem-solving, right? That's a big deal, like an attitude or maybe I don't know what you call like a paradigm shift in the way you think. Thinking \"Man, I don't want to try that.\" Now she's  thinking, \"What can I do to solve this problem?\"  Anna: When we say Miana has gained confidence, it's not just because of the skills itself. It's because of the way the interaction is with all your people — Maria, Mary — they just work well.  When you have a program like this, you're teaching the kids skills that are needed for just being part of society,  your everyday necessary skills. It's not a program that's going to teach you something extra like I'm learning a skill for a sport or I'm learning to dance, you know, things of that sort. It's a necessary skill like learning to walk. You should be able to have access to learn how to navigate your community and your environment with those foundational skills.  Jonathan: If I need to go to navigate through the insurance process to get my daughter into this program, I'd do it. There's a lot of parents that would go through that too. They understand the value of something, a program like this. But there's other kids whose parents may not entertain the thought because of other priorities, but those kids would definitely benefit from it.

Cork, Ireland. The partnership focuses on finding ways to create synergy between our community-based and academic perspectives for improving lives and care for persons with neuro-physical disabilities. Out of our shared work, Crann introduced our team at IU to the concept of wheelchair skill training for children. Generous philanthropy from the Lilly Family to the Riley Children's Foundation has supported both the creation of the collaboration and the launching of the IUPUI Skills on Wheels program.  [Crann Centre](https://cranncentre.ie/)  We are grateful to all involved for their support and funding:   ### Find out more  To learn more about the program email wcskills@iu.edu .
