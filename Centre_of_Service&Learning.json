    "body": "  ## Meet Ayomide Betiku  Ayomide Betiku, a May 2022 graduate from the School of Science at IUPUI, has now earned a bachelor's degree in biology with a minor in Africana studies. She participated in the Community Engagement Associate (CEA) Program under the mentorship of Dr. Patricia Turley.  As a CEA, Betiku served as a mentor for other students in two courses: AFRO-A 200 Research in African American and African Diaspora Studies and AFRO-A 364 Research on Contemporary Afro-American Problems II. She helped navigate the research process, unpack course materials, and supported students with research projects. Betiku’s research endeavors surpass guiding and mentoring students. This year she contributed to the larger body of research that enabled students to learn more about their family lineage.  Through the CEA program, Betiku worked on a project called Echoes of Our Ancestors. This project focuses on Black ancestry and the identification of common traditions and cultures within the African Diaspora. In this project, students could use their family lineage, culture, and traditions to identify ways in which they relate to the African Diaspora. Betiku notes that this project originated through working with other scholars in an effort to compile writings of family narratives. This writing collaboration revealed a way to connect back to the Diaspora.  Although the project was rewarding, Betiku had some difficulties with the process. For example, this was the first time Betiku was able to record some of her family narratives. She explained that it was challenging to ask questions and compile a story even though it was her own. With the help of her mentor, Betiku persevered through the challenges and grew both educationally and personally.  View Betiku's ePortfolio  [View Betiku's ePortfolio](https://www.thecn.com/AB2694)   ### Q & A with Ayomide Betiku   #### What is one thing you learned about yourself during your participation in the CEA Program?  One thing I learned about myself during my participation in the CEA program was that I could handle multiple things at once successfully, if I plan my schedule well. I was working on the CEA project, my classes, studying for the MCAT, preparing to graduate, and working on my senior capstone. I had so many things on my plate; however, I was able to succeed in all because of how I planned my schedule and managed my time.   #### What did your day-to-day look like as a CEA?  My day-to-day as a CEA included gathering data and information about my project and having meetings with my mentor.   #### What was the highlight of your time as a CEA?  The highlight of my time as a CEA was working with my mentor on our project that will be published and being able to present it with other students at the IUPUI research day.   #### What is one key takeaway you would like other students to know about your time as a CEA?  With the project I worked on with my mentor, I did not only work on it but also learned, which I believe will help me as I progress in my career. "

    "body": "  ## Recruiting for the Community Work-Study Program  The Community Work-Study (CWS) Program engages community partners and students in meaningful work experiences that not only help partners reach their organizational goals but also help students learn and develop through community-based, real-world experiences. Approved nonprofit and government agencies can hire students and only pay 25% of their wages.  If your organization is interested in becoming a CWS employer, please complete our community partner intake form to let us know of your interest. Eligible organizations are 501(c)(3) nonprofits or government agencies with the capacity and desire to employ students in community-focused, meaningful work opportunities. Applications are accepted annually.   ### Prospective employers  Find out how your organization can employ CWS students as interns at your agency. If you have questions, please contact cwsjobs@iupui.edu .   ### Current employers  The section below contains different forms and procedures to support you in your work with our students.   ### Frequently asked questions   #### What is the Federal Work-Study Program?  The Federal Work-Study (FWS) Program provides an opportunity for part-time employment for students with financial need, allowing students to earn money to help pay for educational expenses. The program encourages community service and work related to students’ programs of study. FWS p ositions can be on campus or off campus at approved nonprofit and government agencies.   #### What is the Community Work-Study Program?  The Community Work-Study (CWS) Program provides opportunities for students to earn their Federal Work-Study Program awards by working in approved nonprofit or government agencies. The goal of CWS is to meet the staffing needs of the agencies while providing students with opportunities that include both satisfactory pay and educationally meaningful experiences without displacing or replacing employees in existing staff positions.   #### How can my agency become an approved CWS employer?  Contact the IUPUI Center for Service and Learning at 317-278-3402 or cwsjobs@iupui.edu for more information. As a government or nonprofit agency, you may be considered for eligibility as a Community Work-Study employer. Several documents must be completed, signed, and submitted for review by Indiana University’s compliance officer. Should your agency be eligible to seek approval, completion of the review takes approximately two to three weeks after receiving required documentation from the agency.   #### What happens after my agency is approved as a CWS employer?  If your organization is approved as a Community Work-Study employer, your organization will be assigned an Indiana University account number. You will also receive a letter and information (via email) from the IUPUI Center for Service and Learning regarding your account number, recruitment, and hiring work-study-eligible students.   #### Who is responsible for recruiting, selecting, training, and supporting the student employees?  Staff at the approved Community Work-Study agency are responsible for recruiting, selecting, training, and supporting student employees. The Center for Service and Learning will provide you with detailed information on how to recruit IUPUI work-study students. Students should be trained and supported in accordance with your agency’s standard practices for employees. Students in CWS positions must be supervised on-site by a paid agency staff member. Students may not do any work-study work from home.   #### As a CWS employer, what is our financial obligation?  Community Work-Study employers are responsible for 25% of the student’s wages; the remaining 75% portion will be paid with federal funds. Each time you hire a student, you will receive an invoice via email from Indiana University for 25% of the student's Federal Work-Study award limit. Student work-study award limits vary and will be stated on their Federal Work-Study authorization form, which the student will receive electronically. For example, if a student’s Federal Work-Study award limit is $3,000, you will be invoiced $750; the payment will go into your Indiana University account. Each time a student is paid, a withdrawal will be made from your Indiana University account to cover your portion of the student’s wages for that pay period. Any unused amount in your account will be refunded upon request or will remain as a credit in your account.   #### As a CWS employer, is there a limit to the number of students my agency may hire?  Yes. We want to ensure that students have a variety of positions from which to choose while also allowing more agencies to hire IUPUI students. The following applies to the number of students an agency may hire:  1. Agencies may employ up to, but no more than, eight work-study students at one time. (Should a student terminate from the position, the agency may hire a new student to replace that terminated student.)  2. Agencies must provide one paid supervisor per five students.  Should you feel that your agency could benefit from more students than the above requirements allow, you may submit an appeal letter for review. Contact cwsjobs@iupui.edu for more information regarding content for this appeal letter.   #### How much are students paid per hour, and how much are they able to earn?  Hourly pay rates are determined by the Community Work-Study agency. Per federal and Indiana University regulations, students must receive at least $10.15 per hour. Pay must be commensurate with that of other employees who are doing the same work, but do not have work-study awards. A pay rate should always be determined by the value of the job, not by the size of the work-study award. Please contact cwsjobs@iupui.edu if you want to discuss pay rate further.  Students may earn as much of their work-study award amount as specified on the Federal Work-Study authorization form. Gross pay is used in calculating how much the student has earned. For example, if a student has an award of $3,000 and has a pay rate of $10.15 per hour, the student may work a total of 295 hours over the course of the Federal Work-Study eligibility period to earn his or her entire work-study award. If a student earns in excess of his or her work-study award amount, the CWS employer will be responsible for 100% of the student’s wages beyond the award amount, and the student will be immediately terminated from the CWS position.   #### How many hours per week can a student work?  The number of hours a student may work partially depends on the amount of the student’s Federal Work-Study award, your needs, and the student’s preference and schedule. Most students work 10–12 hours per week, and that range is highly recommended so that students are able to effectively balance work and school obligations. Students may work during IUPUI holidays and during the winter break between fall and spring semesters if they are returning to IUPUI immediately afterward. However, it is important to continue tracking your student’s earnings during those breaks to ensure they are not earning their award too quickly. If you feel that working over a break would lead them to earn their award too quickly, you can suggest they do not work during those times. It is important to note that the Federal Work-Study eligibility periods are listed on the annual program roles and responsibilities. There is an academic year period (mid-August through mid-May) and summer period (mid-May through mid-August). Academic year awards may not be used during summer and vice versa. Any unearned money is forfeited by the student.   #### How do students track hours worked, and how do students get paid?  Students record hours worked by logging into IU’s online Kuali Time System via a computer or other internet-enabled device at your agency. You, as the employer, will also go online and approve each student’s timesheet at the end of a pay period. Paychecks are issued by the IUPUI payroll office. If the student has not signed up for direct deposit, the student will receive a university-issued Visa debit card, and the paycheck will be deposited onto that card. Once your agency is approved, you will receive a tutorial on the TIME system.   #### When hiring students, how do I know if they are eligible for Federal Work-Study?  Students can provide verification of their work-study award by printing a copy of their financial aid package from One.IU.   #### How do students get a Federal Work-Study award?  Federal Work-Study awards are based on the student’s submission of the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) and a determination of financial need. For entering freshmen, Federal Work-Study awards are based on students' indication on the FAFSA of interest in Federal Work-Study and eligibility for the federal Pell Grant program. For continuing students, Federal Work-Study awards are based on submission of the FAFSA, financial need, and students' use of their Federal Work-Study awards during the preceding award year. In addition, students may contact the Office of Student Financial Services ( finaid@iupui.edu ) to request consideration for a Federal Work-Study award based on a determination of eligibility and availability of the campus’s Federal Work-Study funding. Undergraduates must be enrolled in at least 6 credit hours each semester (4 credit hours each semester for graduate students) to maintain Federal Work-Study eligibility during the academic year (fall and spring). To be considered for a Federal Work-Study award during the summer, students must be enrolled in at least one class at IUPUI.   ### Resources for current Community Work-Study Program employers  [Hiring a student Visit the Office of Student Employment to get started in hiring a student for community work-study.](https://recruiting.iupui.edu/hiring-resources/index.html)   #### Hiring a student  Visit the Office of Student Employment to get started in hiring a student for community work-study.

    "body": "  ## ICELER faculty learning community  The Integrating Community-Engaged Learning through Ethical Reflection (ICELER) faculty learning community is part of a five-year grant (2018–2023) funded by the National Science Foundation and is led by researchers in the STEM Education Innovation Research Institute (SEIRI), the Center for Service and Learning, and the Purdue University School of Engineering Education.   #### The grant aims to:   ### Develop and implement an intervention  Develop a faculty learning community to promote change in ethics instruction in STEM departments and in the ethical subjectivities of faculty and the undergraduates in their courses.   ### Exploring organizational change  Identify and analyze the macro-level organizational outcomes and changes associated with the formation of ethical cultures of STEM, specifically those arising from the project intervention, to identify and to explain the factors related to the transformation of ethics curriculum at the department level.   ### Analyzing individual change  Identify and analyze the micro-level individual outcomes and changes associated with ICELER courses to understand the processes and variables related to the ethical training and formation of STEM faculty and undergraduates.  The faculty learning community component is intended to support networking and shared capacity building for the transformation of STEM curricula and practice. The faculty learning community constitutes a social learning and inquiry environment designed to foster individual and joint examination of faculty relationships with teaching and explore theories and concepts related to ethics education, as well as experiment with methods that integrate ethical reflection and community engagement.  Faculty members from two departments, Biomedical Engineering and Earth Sciences, alongside members of the research team have worked together since 2018.   ### Additional resources   #### ICELER faculty showcase  Institutional Transformation: Enhancing IUPUI STEM Curriculum through the Community-Engaged Learning and Ethical Reflection Framework (ICELER)  [Institutional Transformation: Enhancing IUPUI STEM Curriculum through the Community-Engaged Learning and Ethical Reflection Framework (ICELER)](https://seiri.iupui.edu/externalawards/ccestemtransformation.html)   #### Faculty learning community resources  An Introduction to the Integrated Community-Engaged Learning and Ethical Reflection Framework (ICELER)  [An Introduction to the Integrated Community-Engaged Learning and Ethical Reflection Framework (ICELER)](https://scholarworks.iupui.edu/items/9b48bd86-eedd-4b44-b945-3fb0973631b0)   #### 2018-2019 faculty presentations   ### Biomedical engineering:  [Engineering Ethics in an Undergraduate Biomedical Engineering Curriculum, Steven Higbee, Julie Ji, Sharon Miller, John Schild, Joey Wallace](https://indiana.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/msteams_92d57a/EdN7nBv55B5BtFuItLiq7n0Bnm-hvPfiNaI3a_AbuxpLkw?e=I6jNWB)   ### Earth sciences:  [G107 Earth and Our Environment, Tom Rossbach](https://indiana.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/msteams_92d57a/EWMvhxFgTudDn0YMoW7rvbkBMkD0SvF0DEqk89AVowKidA?e=hYVTKF)  [G334 Principles of Sedimentology and Stratigraphy, Kathy Licht](https://indiana.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/msteams_92d57a/EWYLdODD0kZPsrSregmG5woBDRK3LZBUBSbzLXnY1wn9dQ?e=JKkIeX)  [G335 Evolution of the Earth and Life, Bill Gilhooly​](https://indiana.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/msteams_92d57a/EdlGG8OnG-lFg9HviuFylF4BpG0Eb_8cmkKxLKmI2ZrP9g?e=ODAT5s)  [G430 Principles of Hydrology, Lixin Wang](https://indiana.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/msteams_92d57a/ESQn1pDvWKdIqpMTKachmCwBh6AtQ6VLSVHhF6OZd3TKOA?e=ipeePW)  [G488 Global Biochemical Cycles, Gabe Filippeli](https://indiana.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/msteams_92d57a/EYvfG3wBGUtGlNBnJDvsWB8BDZPbaLIviVEnA4cC_EXvUA?e=qhShsP)   #### 2019-2020 faculty presentations   ### Biomedical engineering team presentation:  [Biomedical engineering team presentation:](https://iu.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/t/1_rpwcykh0)     ### Earth sciences team presentation:  [Earth sciences team presentation:](https://iu.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/t/1_adm20moa)     ### Research team  Kathy Johnson , Lead PI, Academic Affairs Grant Fore , Senior Personnel, SEIRI Justin Hess , Co-PI, Engineering Education, Purdue University Brandon Sorge , Co-PI, SEIRI Martin Coleman , Co-PI, IAT Mary Price, Co-PI, CSL Tom Hahn , Technical Consultant, CSL/IEL [2017–2021] Samuel Nyarko , Post-Doctoral Fellow, SEIRI Elizabeth Sanders , GA, Purdue   #### Earth sciences faculty  Greg Druschel Gabe Filippelli Bill Gilhooly Kathy Licht Tom Rossbach Lixin Wang  [Greg Druschel](https://science.iupui.edu/people-directory/people/druschel-gregory.html)  [Gabe Filippelli](https://science.iupui.edu/people-directory/people/filippelli-gabriel.html)  [Bill Gilhooly](https://science.iupui.edu/people-directory/people/gilhooly-william.html)  [Kathy Licht](https://science.iupui.edu/people-directory/people/licht-kathy.html)  [Tom Rossbach](https://science.iupui.edu/people-directory/people/rossbach-thomas.html)  [Lixin Wang](https://science.iupui.edu/people-directory/people/wang-lixin.html)   #### Biomedical engineering faculty  Steve Higbee Julie Ji Sharon Miller John Schild Joey Wallace  [Steve Higbee](https://et.iupui.edu/people/sjhigbee)  [Julie Ji](https://et.iupui.edu/people/jji)  [Sharon Miller](https://et.iupui.edu/people/sm11)  [John Schild](https://et.iupui.edu/people/jschild)  [Joey Wallace](https://et.iupui.edu/people/jmwalla) "

During the 2022–23 academic year, she participated in the Community Engagement Associates (CEA) Program, under the mentorship of Lois Silverman, Ph.D., and Laura Holzman, Ph.D.  [Lois Silverman, Ph.D.,](https://liberalarts.iupui.edu/programs/museum-studies/directory/lois-h-silverman/)  [Laura Holzman, Ph.D.](https://liberalarts.iupui.edu/programs/museum-studies/directory/laura-holzman/)  As a CEA, Marissa is serving as the programs and project manager for the Museum of Broken Relationships Indianapolis (MBRI), which is a unique collaboration between the Museum of Broken Relationships in Zagreb, Croatia, the Museum Studies Program at IUPUI, and Herron Galleries. The project collected stories and objects from the Indianapolis community that tell stories of heartbreak—whether that be romantic, familial, personal, or any other type.  [Museum of Broken Relationships Indianapolis](https://herron.iupui.edu/mbr/index.html)  These collected objects and stories are now part of the exhibition housed in Herron Galleries on campus. In addition to the exhibit, there are multiple programs being offered throughout the spring semester that are part of the MBRI project, which is where Marissa has supported the international project.  Through the CEA program, Marissa worked closely with Dr. Silverman's fall 2022 Museum Education course to plan and implement programs throughout the duration of the MBRI exhibit. Her work involved a great deal of logistical planning, including communicating with community partners and ensuring smooth event operations. Marissa is also working to design and refine student-created online resources to increase the reach and accessibility of the exhibit within the Indianapolis community.  One of the ongoing challenges of community-engaged work is making sure that every community collaborator is seen, heard, and accommodated.  Although the project was rewarding, Marissa did encounter difficulties influenced by the mere scope and size of the project. In the reality of project planning, Marissa admits \"working within a budget is always difficult when you have big dreams!\" She also addressed the challenges of adhering to timelines and satisfying community partner goals. She quickly learned that reviewing expectations and plans throughout the whole process is necessary in any community project.  View Marissa's LinkedIn  [View Marissa's LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marissa-hamm)   ### Q & A with Marissa Hamm   #### What is one thing you learned about yourself during your participation in the CEA Program?  I learned that I really enjoy helping ideas come to life. The process of working with other team members and community members to see a vision come to fruition is very fulfilling work, and although it can have its points of stress, seeing the visitors at each event fully engaged and enjoying the program makes it all worth it.   #### What did your day-to-day look like as a CEA?  Every single week looked different! In the fall semester, a lot of my time was spent researching, emailing, and creating planning documents leading up to the exhibit. The spring semester has been much more chaotic, and I am thankful for all of the planning we did in the fall.  I spend a lot of my time pulling together the remaining logistics and then helping to set up, run, and take down the events. I also spend a good deal of time designing products for our online resources and in-person activities. The one consistent thing is weekly meetings with my supervisor to brainstorm new ideas and make sure we're on the same page!   #### What was the highlight of your time as a CEA?  The highlight so far was seeing our first event take place. The event, \"A Fair of the Heart: Valentine's Night with the Museum of Broken Relationships Indianapolis,\" took place on February 14 at Herron Galleries and included multiple fun activity tables, two student-led workshops, and the gallery was open after hours. A lot of planning went into the event, and it turned out so well. Everyone who attended had a smile on their face, and it was a joy to see the students succeed in offering their programs to real audiences.   #### What is one key takeaway you would like other students to know about your time as a CEA?  Being a CEA affords you an opportunity to be a part of a project that is very different than what you would experience in a classroom. It makes you feel more connected to Indianapolis and the many community members who live here. All around, it is a rewarding experience to be a part of—plus it helps to build your professional resume! "

The PSFLC was conceived as a three-year initiative co-sponsored by Academic Affairs and the Center for Service and Learning.  The PSFLC is charged with defining public scholarship, identifying criteria to assist faculty in documenting their community-engaged work, and engaging deans and department chairs in adapting criteria into promotion and tenure materials within school and departmental guidelines.   ### Public scholarship defined  IUPUI defines public scholarship as an intellectually and methodologically rigorous endeavor that is responsive to public audiences and public peer review. It is scholarly work that advances one or more academic disciplines by emphasizing co-production of knowledge with community stakeholders.   ### Our work  The PSFLC has developed resource materials to support candidates, review committees, faculty administrators, and external reviewers in planning for, interpreting, and evaluating excellence in publicly engaged scholarship.  In addition, the PSFLC has also been an avenue to:  The PSFLC was able to secure a fourth year of support to continue its work through the spring of 2019.

    "body": "  ## Making a difference  Each year on behalf of the chancellor, the Office of Community Engagement collects information from instructors about courses they taught during the academic year that included one or more modes of community-based teaching, including but not limited to service learning. In the 2014 academic year, the focus of data collection expanded to capture community-based learning. The shift from service learning to community-based learning reflects a broader scope of engaged learning and attends to a wide range of campus-community partnerships.  The purpose of the Curricular Engagement report is to provide faculty, staff, and administrators with information that illustrates the frequency of community-based learning at IUPUI. The report contains descriptive information about curricular engagement as it relates to types of courses (e.g., internships, practicum), course level (e.g., graduate, undergraduate), and formal course designations (e.g., RISE).  The information is intended to be used as a starting point for conversations within units about how faculty are partnering with the community and opportunities to explore how this is related to both student learning and success and partnership outcomes. The information is also used as evidence to support the civic engagement mission of the institution, including award applications, reports, performance indicators, and faculty/staff/departmental development strategies.   ### Community engagement archived reports   #### IUPUI community engagement report  The Office of Community Engagement (OCE) was launched in January 2015 as a priority within the IUPUI Strategic Plan . OCE was charged with developing a strategic approach to community engagement that would coordinate, evaluate, promote, celebrate, and assess the impact of IUPUI student, faculty, and staff engagement activities.  [IUPUI Strategic Plan](https://strategicplan.iupui.edu/)  As a collective and on behalf of the campus, OCE is committed to cultivating knowledge, relationships, and resources through collaborations that contribute to healthy and vibrant communities; foster mutual growth, equity, and social justice; strengthen our commitment to democratic engagement; advance university and campus goals; and prepare civic-minded graduates and professionals.  The 2015 IUPUI Community Engagement Report was developed to assist campus administrators and schools in understanding the type and levels of engagement of IUPUI students, faculty, staff, and alumni and to plan responses to new campus annual reporting guidelines for AY 2015–2016.

During the 2022–23 academic year, she participated in the Community Engagement Associates (CEA) Program, under the mentorship of Lois Silverman, Ph.D., and Laura Holzman, Ph.D.  [Lois Silverman, Ph.D.,](https://liberalarts.iupui.edu/programs/museum-studies/directory/lois-h-silverman/)  [Laura Holzman, Ph.D.](https://liberalarts.iupui.edu/programs/museum-studies/directory/laura-holzman/)  As a CEA, Marissa is serving as the programs and project manager for the Museum of Broken Relationships Indianapolis (MBRI), which is a unique collaboration between the Museum of Broken Relationships in Zagreb, Croatia, the Museum Studies Program at IUPUI, and Herron Galleries. The project collected stories and objects from the Indianapolis community that tell stories of heartbreak—whether that be romantic, familial, personal, or any other type.  [Museum of Broken Relationships Indianapolis](https://herron.iupui.edu/mbr/index.html)  These collected objects and stories are now part of the exhibition housed in Herron Galleries on campus. In addition to the exhibit, there are multiple programs being offered throughout the spring semester that are part of the MBRI project, which is where Marissa has supported the international project.  Through the CEA program, Marissa worked closely with Dr. Silverman's fall 2022 Museum Education course to plan and implement programs throughout the duration of the MBRI exhibit. Her work involved a great deal of logistical planning, including communicating with community partners and ensuring smooth event operations. Marissa is also working to design and refine student-created online resources to increase the reach and accessibility of the exhibit within the Indianapolis community.  One of the ongoing challenges of community-engaged work is making sure that every community collaborator is seen, heard, and accommodated.  Although the project was rewarding, Marissa did encounter difficulties influenced by the mere scope and size of the project. In the reality of project planning, Marissa admits \"working within a budget is always difficult when you have big dreams!\" She also addressed the challenges of adhering to timelines and satisfying community partner goals. She quickly learned that reviewing expectations and plans throughout the whole process is necessary in any community project.  View Marissa's LinkedIn  [View Marissa's LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marissa-hamm)   ### Q & A with Marissa Hamm   #### What is one thing you learned about yourself during your participation in the CEA Program?  I learned that I really enjoy helping ideas come to life. The process of working with other team members and community members to see a vision come to fruition is very fulfilling work, and although it can have its points of stress, seeing the visitors at each event fully engaged and enjoying the program makes it all worth it.   #### What did your day-to-day look like as a CEA?  Every single week looked different! In the fall semester, a lot of my time was spent researching, emailing, and creating planning documents leading up to the exhibit. The spring semester has been much more chaotic, and I am thankful for all of the planning we did in the fall.  I spend a lot of my time pulling together the remaining logistics and then helping to set up, run, and take down the events. I also spend a good deal of time designing products for our online resources and in-person activities. The one consistent thing is weekly meetings with my supervisor to brainstorm new ideas and make sure we're on the same page!   #### What was the highlight of your time as a CEA?  The highlight so far was seeing our first event take place. The event, \"A Fair of the Heart: Valentine's Night with the Museum of Broken Relationships Indianapolis,\" took place on February 14 at Herron Galleries and included multiple fun activity tables, two student-led workshops, and the gallery was open after hours. A lot of planning went into the event, and it turned out so well. Everyone who attended had a smile on their face, and it was a joy to see the students succeed in offering their programs to real audiences.   #### What is one key takeaway you would like other students to know about your time as a CEA?  Being a CEA affords you an opportunity to be a part of a project that is very different than what you would experience in a classroom. It makes you feel more connected to Indianapolis and the many community members who live here. All around, it is a rewarding experience to be a part of—plus it helps to build your professional resume! "

The development, acceptance, and wide dissemination of the civic-minded graduate scale and rubric was preceded by the development of the civic-minded professional construct and scale by Julie Hatcher , former executive director of the CSL. The intent was to create a tool for research on professionals who contribute their time, skill, and expertise to others to achieve the collective good. Understanding the traits of these professionals can ultimately contribute to more informed strategies to sustain and to enhance this practice. This inquiry into the public role of professionals led to the concept of CMP being defined and operationalized into a scale and determined to be a reliable measure and valid scale in particular contexts.

    "body": "  ## A flexible tool to help you  Collaborative relationship mapping (ColRM) is a graphic reflection and assessment process designed to build the capacity of those involved to understand and to assess the underlying relationships and networks among them or to self-monitor and to change course midstream.  ColRM is a flexible tool that can be used to meet these aims as well as capture assessment and research data to document partnership practice over time and to document the development of human and social capital devoted to a partnership.  While communication is one of the most significant variables that can impact how collaborative relationships develop, ColRM provides a deeper analysis. The ColRM model moves beyond a constituency-based model of partnerships to consider partnerships as a subset of collaborative relationships. Collaborations consist of interconnected sets of personal relationships, social networks, factions, and coalitions. Focusing partnerships as relationships provides a platform to study relationships in terms of their attributes, allowing for new insights.

For those from higher education and community that commit to civic engagement, there are numerous awards and recognitions that celebrate excellence in this area.  Democracy's promise is rooted in (re)imagining and working toward shared futures that advance social change.

    "body": "  ## Meet Samantha Riley  Samantha Riley is a second-year Master of Arts in Applied Anthropology student in the IU School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI. During Sam’s first academic year in her graduate program (2020–2021), she participated in the Community Engagement Associate (CEA) Program under the mentorship of Dr. Susan Hyatt, professor of anthropology . The CEA Program employs students under the mentorship of faculty and staff to provide support for courses, programs, or projects that advance the community engagement mission of IUPUI.  [the Community Engagement Associate (CEA) Program](https://csl.iupui.edu/programs/community-engagement-associate-program/index.html)  [Dr. Susan Hyatt, professor of anthropology](https://liberalarts.iupui.edu/departments/anthropology/directory/susan-hyatt/)  As a CEA, Sam assisted Dr. Hyatt’s Urban Anthropology course. Sam and Dr. Hyatt applied the learning outcome of the course and incorporated a real-world situation that was happening at the time, the COVID-19 pandemic, into the course curriculum. In the course, students actively researched past epidemics and how they affected cities’ infrastructure to predict what cities will look like post COVID-19.  Sam and Dr. Hyatt knew they wanted to showcase their students’ work, but they did not know how to do so with IUPUI being mostly remote. After some research and inspiration from other universities and other faculty members, they pinpointed web presence as their goal. They set their sight on building a website to display their Urban Anthropology students’ work in hopes of documenting this defining period in history and spreading important and thought-provoking topics related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Although Sam has never built a website before, she learned how to navigate WordPress quickly through her own troubleshooting and built covidandthecity.org to bring her mentor’s and her vision to the web. The website highlights the students’ bios, their individual experiences with the pandemic, their relationship with the city before and during the pandemic, and their perception of what the city will look like post-pandemic.  [covidandthecity.org](https://www.covidandthecity.org/)  Sam is currently working at the Indianapolis VA Medical Center and has used the website building skills she learned in her CEA project to build a website for her study at the medical center. During this academic year, she is looking forward to adding new skills to her tool kit, wrapping up her thesis, and assisting with Dr. Hyatt’s ethnographic field course in spring 2022 under the CEA program.  You can visit the website Covid and the City to view Sam's final project.  [Visit Covid and the City](https://covidandthecity.org)   ### Q & A with Sam   #### What is one thing you learned about yourself during your participation in the CEA Program?  Before working on this project, I thought I was a slow learner. However, when I was building the website through WordPress, I had to learn that skill on the fly. I overcame that hurdle relatively quickly and picked up the skills I needed as I worked on the project.   #### What did your day-to-day look like as a CEA?  I looked through literature, websites, and resources to send to students, which helped them with their own research projects for the class. I also reached out to guest speakers to bring to our class Zoom calls. I also worked on the Covid and the City website.   #### What was the highlight of your time as a CEA?  Dr. Hyatt served as a mentor for the CEA program and as my graduate advisor. She provided me with a lot of support, resources, and ideas. We had a collaborative approach on my tasks and projects. I learned a lot from her help and support.   #### What is one key takeaway you would like other students to know about your time as a CEA?  At first, I thought this would be difficult to add on top of my graduate coursework. I learned that being a CEA added to my course learning and expanded my knowledge of this field. It was also a wonderful way to build a relationship with faculty and staff within my field. "

    "body": "  ## Integrating service into a course or program   ### Project type  The scope of projects will vary based on the learning and service objectives established for the course. Some projects may involve ongoing direct interaction with those served (e.g., tutoring programs, participatory action research, program evaluation). Projects of this type are referred to as direct service . By contrast, indirect service projects (e.g., communication or small business plan development, fundraising, issue advocacy, tree survey) demand little face-to-face interaction with residents or clients, but rather engage students in creating products, generating resources, or producing knowledge vital to a community organization, neighborhood, or group. Such projects may also involve raising public awareness or stimulating dialogue on an issue of public or social concern.  View examples of each type of engagement activity  [View examples of each type of engagement activity](https://indiana.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/msteams_92d57a/EUDOpWiCc5ZOg2J7PbBzOPwBU2nUnmx7z8t8gOlV1HPDcA?e=NYZyox)   ### Context  Service projects can be situated in a wide range of physical settings and contexts domestically and internationally. Similarly, the use of service projects as examples of active and collaborative learning may occur in any number of academic contexts, including:   ### Dosage and periodicity  Depending on the scope of the task, service projects also vary in the amount of time students spend on the project and the frequency of their contributions. In some cases, an instructor may want to expose students to an issue by developing a mini-immersion or single-day service project. Such projects are commonly used in first-year courses both to create a sense of camaraderie among the students and to introduce the civic engagement as a dimension of the collegiate learning experience.  There is no single correct answer to the question of how much service is required for learning to happen. Researchers and practitioners contend that single-day immersive experiences, while a valuable learning tool, are insufficient to support authentic relationship building among students and community residents. Instead, engaging students in regular cycles of contact with community members over the course of a semester (or longer if possible), particularly when coupled with intentional analysis of the experience, increases the likelihood that students will expand their capacity to demonstrate empathy and examine issues from multiple standpoints.   ### Required or optional  Best practice indicates that service should be integrated deeply into the course architecture to minimize the perception among students that the service is an add-on rather than an integral component of the learning to be generated through the course. However, integration does not necessarily translate into required. Indeed, course designers can choose to integrate the service project and associated assignments as just one option for students to select from to practice their learning of a core course concept in context.

This program recognizes that the core of community-engaged work is relational work—work that takes time to build and work that cannot be done by individuals alone. Community-engaged faculty and staff may receive funding to employ students to provide support for courses, programs, or projects that advance the community-engagement mission of IUPUI in any of the following ways:   ### CEA student learning outcomes  In accordance with the IUPUI Profiles of Learning for Undergraduate Success , experience in CEA positions will help students meet the learning outcomes below and become acquainted with the following profiles:   #### Communicator   #### Community contributor   #### Problem solver   ### Program components  Summer only: project will run during the upcoming summer term. Academic year only: project will run during the next academic year. One-full year: project will run during the upcoming summer term and the next academic year.   ### Program expectations   #### Step 1: Apply for CEA funding  Submit application  [Submit application](https://forms.office.com/r/GPa98PN499)   #### Step 2: Application review  A committee in CSL will review CEA application submissions. Applicants will be notified of their application status by April 1. The position description submitted by the mentor during the application process will be used to create a custom posting of the mentor’s opportunity in Handshake, the student employment portal for IUPUI. If selected for funding, the Institute for Engaged Learning will post position descriptions in Handshake on the following timeline:  The mentor will receive an email from the Institute for Engaged Learning when the position is posted and students can begin applying through Handshake. The mentor will review applications in Handshake, conduct interviews, and make a hiring decision. Interview pools should have a minimum of three candidates.   #### Step 3: Initiate hiring process  Once a student is identified, the mentor will use the form below to initiate the hiring process with the Institute for Engaged Learning. The Institute for Engaged Learning will contact the identified student to begin the hiring process, which can take up to three or four weeks to complete.  The mentor and unit will receive an official email from the Division of Undergraduate Education Human Resources (DUE-HR) with the official hire and start date. The student may not begin employment until this official email from DUE-HR is received.  Please plan accordingly if your project is commencing soon.

    "body": "  ## Ethical tensions in service learning and community engagement  Service learning and other forms of community-engaged learning are often associated with positive outcomes for learners and host communities, but the reality is more complex.  The presence of university students in communities by itself does not guarantee mutual benefit for either university students or host communities locally or abroad. Rather, good intentions can result in deepening stereotypes, weakened local capacity, or the production of products that are not perceived as relevant to, usable by, or sustainable in the communities with whom students engage.   ### Why ethical engagement matters in the classroom and communities  Engaging students and communities in these questions as part of community-based and community-engaged learning experiences supports modeling practices and fostering meaning-making that encourages the development of what Paulo Freire described as praxis that is “reflection and action upon the world in order to transform it” (Freire, 1972, p. 52), resulting in ethical, self-aware, responsive, and accountable action. Praxis doesn’t just involve the head. Rather, praxis involves \"knowing, doing and being” (p. 226).  Course and program planning as sites to address ethical engagement "

SOFAR refers to a conceptual framework for organizing community-campus partnerships. The framework consists of five stakeholder constituencies: student, community organization staff, faculty, campus administrators and staff, and community residents.

Others have identified potential categories for examining community impact.

Bantz Chancellor's Community Fellowship](https://trip.iupui.edu/Awards/Community-Fellowships)   ## IUPUI faculty exemplars   #### Getting to yes in tenure and promotion—essential documentation strategies  Description of the video:  Hi I'm Laura Holzman and I'm going to share with you the story around defining my scholarly identity as I prepared my desk CA for tenure and promotion to associate professor this is the third segment of a four part presentation that my colleagues and I gave at the two thousand and eighteen National Campus contact conference. In many ways my professional practice is defined by hybridity So it's especially important and maybe especially challenging for me to create an integrated cohesive scholarly identity my degree is in the interdisciplinary humanities based field of visual studies I hold a joint appointment as associate professor of art history and Museum Studies at I.P.O. I want to share my time between the art school and the school of liberal arts I also have an additional title of public scholar so there's a lot of ways to name me and my work and my work in compass is many different things my public scholar title means that engagement is built into my job description it's part of how I have to find myself and my work from the beginning. Practices of public scholarship are in that it in the structure and goals of the museum studies program here so there's a high degree of scholarly congregants in that aspect of my job but engage scholarship in art history is in a much earlier stage of development and there's less scholarly Congar and in that area of my job. I started working with Mary Price the director of faculty development in the center for service and learning and I Not long after I came to the university and my goal then was to hone methods for doing rigorous in Gauge scholarship and to learn the scholarship of engagement so that I could give substance to my hunches and develop better informed. Acta says when it came time to prepare my materials for tenure and promotion a new set of questions arose like how do I tell a cohesive story about myself and how do I advocate evaluators who might not be familiar with the scholarship and practices of engagement and this is where the coaching that I was doing with Mary became even more valuable. I do traditional and engage scholarship and my engaged practices can look very different from one another working with Mary helped me to articulate a cohesive integrated scholarly identity and explain to my evaluators how the different aspects of my work corresponded with one another. Scholarly activity mapping and relationship mapping were part of this work and you can learn about those techniques elsewhere in this presentation in this segment I'm going to spotlight what came out of our work with scholarly identity mapping So here's my identity map based on this work I've come to call myself an engaged art historian this identity is very similar to the public scholar model that Scott Peters and his colleagues articulated in democracy in higher education but what I realized was that advocating for the discipline of art history is actually an important part of why I do what I do so I've included that language in how I've named my scholarly identity. As an engaged art historian I use art history its methods and its related institutions to strengthen communities and create a more reflective society. My work operates across the spectrum that ranges from traditional scholarship to democratically in Gauge practices and most of my projects fall somewhere in the middle of that spectrum they're all guided by the question how can art history be a tool for addressing issues that people outside of academia deem important. And identifying the values that guide my work I determined that trustworthiness is a foundational element and that's why you'll see it on the bottom of my triangle this in compass is the rigor of my practices the way I build relationships with current and potential collaborators and the way I try to bring a degree of approachability to my work whether it's interpersonal interactions or the ways in which I disseminate the scholarship. Dialogue is another important value and for me it's both a method and a topic of study in my collaborative work we use dialogue as a key part of exchanging ideas and building relationships and my traditional scholarship looks at the role that dialogue plays in making meaning around art and community identity. The third keep all you have my work is creativity and by this I really. In connecting the dots in unexpected ways whether that's something I'm doing on my own something I'm inviting project partners to do for themselves or something that we're doing together. As you can see in the center of the triangle research teaching and service work together in my intercalated practice but I view research as the dominant area of my work and I identified it as my area of excellence for tenure and promotion. Part of this was actually a strategic decision if research tends to be privileged in academia I wanted to advocate for the value of public scholarship and gauged our history by demonstrating how it contributes to an excellent research program in finding the language of engaged art history I found a unifying concept behind my joint appointment my interdisciplinary background and a spectrum of practice that ranges from traditional to democratically engaged and what I'd like to show you is an example of how this translated into the specific language that I used in my candidate statement. Here's how I framed my work. As with other publicly engaged academic work engaged art history operates across a spectrum of methods and product at one end of that spectrum is traditional academic work I study and teach about publicly significant topics using humanities based methods from visual studies I share my findings in conventional peer reviewed outlets such as academic conferences journal articles and a book at the other end of the spectrum is democratically and gauged academic work I collaborate with community partners to define project goals create new knowledge together and build a more participatory democracy my partners and I share our work and outlets that are most meaningful to the community such as public programs and community members participate in evaluating the impact of the work most of my projects fall somewhere between these two ends of the spectrum. In addition to helping me find the language to describe my work the coaching tools that I worked on with Mary gave me a kind of space for reflecting on my practice that I wouldn't necessarily have taken otherwise and it was in that space of deliberate critical reflection that I came to recognize engaged art history as both an important part of my process and as a topic of study it's a growing area in my field and I'm one of the people helping to define and develop it. The people who reviewed my tenure and promotion dossier recognize this. One person who provided feedback on my work noted that Dr Holzman's research brief is a complex one that she negotiates with grace and invasion and brilliance especially as the field of engaged art history is currently an emerging paradigm now I'm stepping out of my comfort zone by sharing a compliment like this but I do it because it's clear evidence that I was able to tell my story in a way that channeled my varied activities into a cohesive and compelling identity I don't think I would have been able to do this as effectively without the scholarly identity mapping in combination with other techniques that my colleagues discussed in other segments of this presentation and also in combination with some of the work around public scholarship that's been happening at the campus level at my university. Working with these tools has definitely given me a stronger sense of agency in the work that I do and in shaping the stories that are told about it and all the feedback I've received on my work has been generally positive in a number of different areas of my practice developing and understanding my integrated scholarly identity has helped me to better articulate what I do when I'm working with or building relationships with community partners. My practice has also become a model for other artists Dorian's who are interested in Gage meant. Because of my public scholar title and the resources I've connected with through Mary's office the reading the mapping and the reflecting that I've done doesn't just serve me it's become a set of tools and techniques that I can share with colleagues who are newer to this kind of work or who are in institutional contexts that have less developed support not mechanisms for public scholarship. And finally since this is a story about preparing for promotion and tenure I can say that my case was indeed successful and I'm now eager to be a resource for other scholars who are interested in building their own tenure and promotion cases around in Gage practices if you'd like to learn more about public scholarship at IP why or the tools that I referred to in this presentation contact the office as listed on the screen my contact information is listed here as well so please feel free to reach out.  Description of the video:  Hi I'm Pam Napier here and I'm going to share with you not only my journey in getting ready for my 3rd year review but also I've used to work with Mary Price director of faculty development and the Center for service and learning to help inform my 5th year dossier for it in your promotion to associate professor this is a 2nd segment of a 4 part presentation that my colleagues and I gave at the 2800 National Campus Compaq conference I'm currently an assistant professor of visual communication design I here in School of Art and Design as well as co-founder of a service design firm here in Indianapolis and working with people to create and improve experiences is a core part of what I do in both teaching and practice and while working within communities is prevalent in many design programs in academia the value for community engaged and public scholarship specifically as it relates to design isn't as much earlier stage of development and there's less scholarly can grew in this area I started working with Mary and various ways but as I got closer so my 3rd year review I specifically sought out her expertise and helping me to one define my scholarly identity and helical hese of story about myself and educate evaluate hers about the practices and scholarship. And because I do both traditional and engage scholarship and my work and both teaching and practice and for one another I needed help telling a story that integrated the various tendrils of my work in this segment I'm going to discuss several tools that Mary help me work through specifically collaborative relationship mapping or combined with identity about being scholarly mapping as a way to situate the products and outcomes of my work within a framework and a planning tool to help inform action steps for evidence that I needed for my 5th year dossier submission. So to start this visual represents a later iteration of my scholarly identity map and it starts to give a bigger picture of my values my public purposes in my approach to my work through working with Mary I've come to define myself as a community engaged scholar practitioner with community engagement as a core focus of my pedagogical approach to teaching I view my teaching practice as an integration of scholarly approach and practical application I integrate problem based curriculum and experience in service learning as pedagogical tools throughout my courses to achieve these teaching goals and the bling students to engage in utilizing design methods for creatively and collaboratively solving problems within various communities and so my teaching informs my design practice and my practice is integrated into my teaching and these are both founded on the beliefs that one all people have the ability to design to that people are experts of their own experiences and 3 and designing with people not for people which all funnels in so being able to enable people to communicate their experiences frame Rouer core problems and create meaningful impact in their lives. It was truly an enlightening and iterative process working with Mary with a series of periodic consulting and coaching meetings with her over the course of about $6.00 to $8.00 months this map shows each meeting and the how the outcome informed the next iteration eventually leading to my 30 year review and then preparation for my 5th year dossiers submission. I 1st started working with Mary in creating identity maps which were used as a reflective activity prior to doing call R.M. to help me clarify and communicate my identity as a community and gauge scholar practitioner and my 3rd year review dossier specifically in my candidate statement where I was declaring teaching as mayor of excellence creating these drafts of identity maps help me to figure out how I situate my work within communities and the intersection of teaching research and service Mary help me think through these intersections prompting me with questions like Who am I as a scholar what are my public purposes and how are those expressed these maps help me to describe what I'm actually doing so activities within these 3 domains of practice communities that I had an affair with and what my opposed to my logical stances which led to community being at the core of my practice my identity is built on the foundational value for being people centered and it is from that perspective that I approach my work in all 4 areas of teaching research service and practice tangentially Mary also helped me work through writing a personal statement along with this near final version of my identity map she prompted me to start with as a community and gauge practitioner Scollard I approach my work. Doing adorations of this statement with her really started to frame the structure for my candidate statement and my dossier and some of the language that I wrote in doing these drafts of my personal statement ended up showing up in my candidate statement in my final dossier. The next step Mary took me through was a scholarly mapping activity which is the visual at the bottom of the slide using a framework to look at the spectrum of activities that happen within teaching research and service and where those activities fall on the continuum of being an engaged scholar This enabled me to look at activities and products from my work and place them on a spectrum to determine the types of things that I have done and could do to demonstrate engage scholarship once the framework is populated the outcomes can then be weighed against proposed criteria for a value adding public scholarship from there Mary help me work through another school collaborative relationship mapping or Cole R.M. which enabled me to identify a core partnership within a singer processing goal project for highlighting in my 3rd year dossier develop a relationship network and then use it for critical reflective practice this helped me to reflect on the relationships within the beginning of this partnership and help to document the relational outcomes of my work this map shown at the top of the page is starting to visualize the relationships within one signature project that myself my students and our community partners have done on the near west side of Indianapolis Colts as a tool really help me to figure out how to highlight a signature project that really illustrated my values pedagogy and epistomological approach to my work and secondly it shifted my understanding of how to look at my body of work how to root myself and build deeper relationships within the collaborative work I am doing in this specific community this is then led to using a planning tool in process for my 5th year dossier and Mary help me to think through the more strategic things I needed to do like how to circle back around with community partners to get feedback and how to engage them and other scholarly activities. After doing call around with Mary I had a new perspective about the relationships I was building at the projects I was doing and how I was communicating about disseminating my work and given what I had learned about myself and community engage scholarship I was able to craft my candidate statement in my 3rd year dossier with more use and more focus and I was able to then structure my argument around highlighting a specific project partnership and how it was helping to drive my future work and this visible a signature project was situated within all 3 domains and then there's a visual for the planning tool and process that I did with Mary we literally got up on the white board and worked through visually mapping how my signature project fit within a broader perspective and I was able to start to see how I could frame and situate my work for the next few years what these visual show is that while I had a signature project that I could start with I also had multiple seemingly disparate projects and was trying to find how they all tied into teaching research and service by somehow highlighting different features of each project and working through the print planning process with Mary C help me figure out that this signature project was the start of a relationship that was at the core of my research teaching and practice and that I was moving from a body of seemingly unrelated projects to being grounded and rooted in a multi-dimensional partnership that was creating multiple relationships and project opportunities. Working through this iterative process with Mary and using the different tools she has developed enabled me to write my candidate statement and frame my work in such a way that it shapes how I approached projects and partnerships for the next few years leading up to my 5th year dossier submission I received very positive feedback from my committee for my 3rd year review and following their feedback in the following 2 years I was able to be more strategic in my external dissemination of projects and more intentional and my approach to projects and partnerships. Working with the planning tool with Mary had really influenced my decision making and strategies looking toward my 5th year in terms of one initiation or continuation and deepening of relationships of projects to how I approach documenting projects 3 seeking publications and other forms of dissemination and for planting the seeds for gathering peer and community feedback since working with Mary and my journey towards 3rd year I was able to secure different projects across the curriculum deepen my partnership within the Near West Side and other community partners and begin setting up expectations for gathering their feedback at the onset of these projects Mary speed helped inform more strategic decisions between my 3rd and 5th year and a few key examples include an online survey tool that I had developed to gather feedback from community partners and residents who were involved in projects this was built off of the public scholar impact survey developed by Dr Healy Wood who at the time was a professor at the school of liberal arts and a public scholar of museums family and learning in addition the public scholarship white paper developed by the faculty learning community on public scholarship also informed how I created and frames questions Another example would be of finding appropriate dissemination venues and publications for my work as well as new projects so here you can see a poster for an international design conference describing engaged work a final recommendations document which was a product that was created collaboratively with several community partners and a book chapter I'm currently writing with a key community partner. Since working with Mary I developed and have more enhanced agency and advocacy with my work because I can speak confidently about it and more easily describe and situate it within community engage scholarship especially from using scholarly identity mapping scholarly activity mapping and specifically collaborative relationship mapping this in turn impacts this idea to use Mary's term of scholarly can grow and it's being able to frame my work in a way that can contribute to a repertoire of shared understanding about what constitutes community engaged scholarship and how to assess it which could ultimately impact not only student learning outcomes but also scholarly productivity I want to share with you an example from my personal statement that for me illustrates my own enhanced sense of agency of my own identity as a scholar and my perception of its impact on my colleagues on the screen you'll see if you highlighted segments that are just a few examples of how the multiple iterations and rounds of crafting a broader statement around my scholarly identity and how I could translate that into specific language backed by evidence enabled me to claim an authentic notion for myself of what it means to be a scholar which I wove throughout my narrative and my dossier this iterative work allowed me to create an arc in the narrative that spoke to the epistomological grounding of my teaching and research that goes beyond traditional notions of outreach and that allowed me to frame what constitutes impact and outcomes in ways that are critical for offering peers and external viewer is a lens through is to evaluate my work while my dossier is currently under review at the campus level I am able to say that I received a unanimous vote from my school's unit tenure promotion Committee as well as wonderful reviews from my department chair and Dean I would not have made it where I am today without Mary's guidance patience and her taking me through the extremely valuable tools and processes she has developed to help nurture or nurture and foster faculty success. Thank you for listening if you have questions about my experience my contact information is listed below Also you can learn more about publicly engaged scholarship and the tools discussed today by contacting the office listed on the screen.    Description of the video:  Hi my name's really would I'm a professor of museum studies and teacher education and associate dean of student affairs in the school of liberal arts and I I am also public scholar of museums families and learning and I was one of the first public scholars to be hired. And I'm going to share with you my story for a promotion and tenure to associate professor and my subsequent promotion to full professor. What I'm going to do today is tell you a little bit about my story as I progressed through the process of promotion and tenure from assistant professor to associate professor and then also from associate to full one of the things that you've no doubt heard many many times is that the promotion and tenure process is really about telling your story so what I decided to do is show you some excerpts from my personal statement and my portfolio to explain a little bit about how I tried to document and demonstrate my impact as a public scholar throughout my process so this first slide you see is a statement from my first personal statement from my tenure dossier and shaping and defining my role as a teacher and researcher to meet community needs and make an impact on the field of museum education and community based learning in this statement prior to having any particular guidance around the role of public scholarship or how we could define it on this campus I chose to think of my work as a public scholar as one of teacher and here you can see I'm defining my self as teacher and researcher and looking at how community is involved in that process but I'm also calling out the specific areas of emphasis where I have in terms of museum education in community based learning and this process was important because it helped me actively define my role as a public scholar and how I chose to do the work in the community and looking out what it was that made a difference in my particular. Process. Another important avenue of public scholarship and civically engaged scholarship is paying attention to the relationships that you're developing with community members and with community partners and defining that in an important way so that you can differentiate your own scholarship from the work that you do with community and that's not discounting the collaborative nature but one of the things you have to learn about promoting yourself or are moving through the promotion process is understanding the types of things that the campus might be looking for or even your own department in terms of the type of work you do so in this statement as I define myself as public scholars teacher I was trying to define the process that I used in terms of working with community members so here I describe myself as looking at a variety of environments to conduct applied research so I'm using this idea of Applied Research as a way of defining some of the publicly and gauge scholarship but also that I've negotiated them both around my personal areas of interest but also with those of the community partners that I work with and one of the things that's important about publicly engaged scholarship is understanding that your activity does not equal the scholarship but the kinds of things do you do together that you focus on that you produce products that are jointly developed or co-create in that are making a difference for some group of people in my case I was looking as my teaching as a public scholarship as a way of helping to educate and work with museums and other communities that were understanding new and different ways of connecting with audiences and developing their own informal learning strategies. As you work through and look through the ten tips for success you'll recognize that there are some key points that are really critical in putting together your dossier one of them is that you need to be documenting early and often but also that process is important as a result and one of the key components of demonstrating your impact which is an important campus level expectation is to figure out how you can capture the information from your community partners in a way that's both meaningful for you but also for them so I developed a survey that I. Defined in terms of what I thought to be the best practices of public scholarship at the time I worked from the existing literature and put together this survey so that I could help my community partners define for the campus what it was that I was doing for them and as you see on the slide the public a scholar impact survey was a series of questions that I asked of multiple community partners from different organizations to define my ability to work with them specifically on a project and as you see key questions here are Did I help identify significant questions did I give people ideas for further work and collaboration did I actually change something in their work did I make an impact was it consistent with the purpose did it have an impact after I left and has it helped people think differently about their work as you can see I did a pretty good job but again thinking about how I'm doing this work is really important in terms of the strategies that I was working with and the ways in which I was collaborating in the second half of the slide house to demonstrate the types of process that I used in working with community partners and again I asked people to focus on my contribution to the project related to their own work and again these items on the survey were related to the existing literature at the time related to public scholarship and I think now is nicely coincides with the existing guidelines from the public scholarship faculty learning community document. When I decided I was ready to seek promotion to full professor I needed to focus on some of the larger components and questions of what promotion to full means and for our campus a lot of that means sustained national impact and international impact and as you can see from my personal statement I'm trying to work through both the promotion criteria as much as I am publicly engaged scholarship criteria and trying to demonstrate across the board how my work has been powerful for community groups as well as the field as well as my profession and in this case I decided to go up on a balance case in order to show that my work had really become quite integrated and as you can see in the slide I'm trying to show as well that my work is recognized across all of these different areas across research teaching and service but also that it has to stay national impact and those kinds of things are important strategies to think about as you begin to understand how to define yourself in public scholarship and to show the local impact that you have that can actually be recognized on a national or international level another one of the key tips that we've talked about frequently is helping people to see what you do that you have to have evidence that explains your process but also the kinds of work that you are doing with the community so as I defined my idea of public scholarship in my day I described this part of my work as a joint conversation between myself and the museum staff that I work with but I can't just say that I can't just assume that people will understand what that means and so I selected a series of signature projects that helped demonstrate the ways in which I work with community partners how we generate questions how we develop the data collection process how we work together and the types of products that we co-create it both for the field for an academic audience and for a public audience and these kinds of things helps me show both a balanced case but also the strategies that I used to work with community partners in a meaningful way. In order to demonstrate the evidence of the work that I had as a publicly engaged scholar I decided to use this matrix like table as a way of demonstrating the integration across areas of research teaching and service but also in terms of the different areas of expertise that I'm claiming is part of my dossier and what you can see here is just a part of a very long document that shows how one particular area of my work was integrated across all three areas but more importantly it shows the ways in which I have produced products related to refereed publications or presentations where there's a student author or a community co-author or other groups that are more King with this cuts across academic professional and community based experiences so it's really demonstrating that integrated work but also gives an example of the types of products and practices that come out of civically engaged publicly scholarship one of the most critical elements in being successful and getting to yes is really understanding the P.N.T. guidelines and understanding the tactics and the strategy that you need to follow and one area in which it matters most critically is in understanding the peer review process who gets to decide your fate besides you and in the case of a publicly gauge scholar I believe that it's important for you to recognize that not only is the peer reviewers external reviewers but it's the community partners the peer reviewers and the field guidelines that help you understand how this process will work I mean you need to advocate for this in your own process especially if you're doing publicly gaged work what's really important is understanding who you can find us allies as critical friends and mentors who understand publicly engage scholarship so that you can help define and shape the process that you want to have happen and articulate that to your primary committee your chair and other people who are involved in the process. In my particular case I sought out a couple of different strategies that I thought were important for helping me work through this peer review process so as I described earlier I created a community based service and to send out to my community partners I designed it I developed it but I had my department administer the survey so that I was impartial or not involved in the process and then I was able to use that result to put together and put into my dossier as I moved from associate to full I sought out letters of reference essentially from majority of community partners and what was interesting about this process was many of them are not familiar with the academic strategies peer review and I thought a problem were people my community partners were contacting me even though they had been independently solicited to write these letters asking what they should put in it and I realized at that point it was really important that we continue to develop strategies for chairs and other committees to come up with the right way of soliciting the information from community partners that's outside of what an academic might expect that might come in the form of interviews or focus groups or even just simple letters of reference a survey something like that that allows people in the community to talk about things in a natural way for them that can also be reviewed and defined by the scholar themselves were also interpreted by a committee. In terms of extra no reviewers as I went through my third year review process we saw and external review were to review my applied work and my public scholarship as a way of helping get an idea of what type of response we might find from the field I found this to be really useful in the sense that it gave insight into what types of things people would be looking for and how they might understand my own articulation of my idea as they considered promotion to full I. Actively try to build on the idea that identified experts outside of academic settings are also viable and legitimate reviewers and while I tried very hard to find those who I felt were important potential such as a president of a national government foundation or a well known public figure my chair my committee were a little bit nervous about that and so while I try it it's definitely something that's worth thinking about who is the people who are right to define what you do and who can see your work in the way that you intended to be that's really what you want to advocate for but in the end it's not your final decision but you can try the last part is looking at field these criteria and the public scholar criteria and again this is a set of materials that are now available from the faculty learning community and public scholarship but also many many more who have nations in the socio outside of academia or who are related or developing their own publicly and gauge scholarship criteria and those are really important strategies to help you define and right you are a personal statement to create potential surveys or different types of materials that you might use to gather that information from these extra reviewers those are the people who are really going to be seen as the most valuable in terms of defining for your dossier the types of impact and contributions that you've made and why they matter external to the University thanks for your time I wish you best of luck in your own endeavors and if you have more questions or seeking more information please contact the name on the slide and to look for publicly engaged scholarship information and resources through scholar works at.    Description of the video:  Hi My name is Julie POR and I'm a clinical associate professor at the I U. school of nursing as I began working on my dossier to move from clinical assistant professor to clinical associate professor I struggled with how to present myself in my teaching statement in the school of nursing there's an unwritten rule that clinical track faculty seek promotion in the area of teaching we've never had any faculty look for promotion in the area of service while I felt that teaching should be my area of Axel and I also wanted to highlight my work as a community engaged scholar but I had no idea how to do that at the School of Nursing We've also been discussing what constitutes scholarship traditionally in nursing scholarship translates to published mainly scripts and research I was unsure of how to articulate who I am as an educator seeking promotion with teaching as my area of excellence but still showcasing my community engagement work as a nurse I'm passionate about ensuring that all members of the community have access to health care much of my service in teaching surrounds work that I have done with my nursing students at the Indiana University student outreach clinic my work with Mary Price began after a colleague from nursing paid a visit to me one day at the outreach clinic. She knew that I was working on my dossier and asked how I felt about presenting my story I'm sure that the fear showed on my face as I respond that I had no idea how to craft a cohesive story that showed who I was as an educator scholar my colleague suggested that Mary Price may be the person who could help me articulate my role as a community engaged scholar. I began working with Mary in October of two thousand and sixteen to help me convey who I was as an educator and community engage scholar well. In the traditional framework that the school of nursing was looking for to evaluate my work my work with Marion created one on one sessions teaching goals inventory identity mapping and scholarly activity mapping I submitted my dossier in August of two thousand and seventeen move through the school with full support of my committee and Dean and received word from the campus in April that I was being promoted to clinical associate professor. My areas of expertise are simulation and in a professional education my work with community engagement began when I was working on a project with a colleague from occupational therapy I was seeing opportunities for my undergraduate students to gain skills and in a professional collaboration I learned about the Indiana University student outreach clinic which aligned very well with my fundamental beliefs as a nurse which you can see listed here in my statement of public purpose I believe that all people should have access to health care regardless of socioeconomic status people should be partners with health professionals and should be active participants in decision making regarding their health as you can see from my identity map I view myself as a community engaged scholar practitioner I was fortunate to be able to combine my desire to serve the community with my scholarship the area of in a professional education and my teaching workload which are founded on the values of community collaboration innovation and equity much of my work at the school focuses on engaging undergraduate students and community service and helping them see that we must partner with community members and collaborate with them to determine what their health goals should be after working through the identity MT myself I shared this with three other colleagues who were also pursuing promotion from clinical. And Professor to clinical associate professor while they did not meet with Mary they did go through the process of creating an identity map each of my colleagues were also promoted to clinical associate professor. My initial reason for pursuing work with Mary was to help me draft narrative language for inclusion into my dossier throughout my work with Mary just as Pam Napier discussed in her vignette we utilized a white board to think and redefine how I see myself as a community gauge scholar the identity map you saw in the last slide is the final draft but as you can see from my flow chart here there were several iterations as I discovered more about myself I have been teaching at the School of Nursing for twelve years but before my work with Mary I never really reflected on how I saw myself nor did I think about how I could frame my story for my primary committee and my peers Mary helped me better explain how my work in a professional education intersected with teaching service and the community as I said earlier my own Nischelle link to the Indian university student outreach clinic was through in a professional education my desire to develop a role for nursing at the clinic came from my fundamental beliefs that every person has a right to health care and a desire to provide nursing services to the Near East Side Indianapolis community while part of my time at the clinic was related to my teaching much of my advising mentoring and the work I did with the nursing student board was voluntary service after working with Mary I was able to hire securely how those areas intersect to reveal who I am as a community scholar I am a proponent of experience learning and empowerment I feel fortunate that I was able to achieve positive learning outcomes with my students they gained experience in collaborating rather than dictating health goals with patients and our patients learned that they are part of the health care team and they do have a voice in their own health you can see on the slide some of the comments made by students on their evaluations after completing a clinical rotation at the outreach clinic the clinic has given me both personal and professional satisfaction after documenting the work I do at the clinic through my work with Mary the dean awarded me a ten percent reduction in workload to continue my work there. All feedback on my dossier from external reviewers internal review from the A.P.C. committee department chair and Dean were highly favorable as I said earlier I was successfully promoted to clinical associate professor. As I worked with Mary through this process I began looking for other ways integrate community outreach and engagement across programs within the school of nursing I am now. Are intentional about developing courses and assignments to integrate teaching service and community engagement I teach in and a professional doctor of nursing practice course last semester students from nursing informatics engineering art and design and Dietetics in nutrition were placed in a professional teams to develop initiatives to combat opioid abuse the student teams partnered with the governor's task force and a local elementary school to develop a variety of initiatives my work with Mary at the Center for service and learning has most definitely had a lasting impact on how I view my work and how I structure learning opportunities for my students since gaming promotion I have accepted a new position managing the simulation center at Fairbanks hall but will continue to teach at the school of nursing as an adjunct clinical associate professor the simulation center is a partnership between the i use of medicine of nursing in Indiana University Health in my new role I hope to work with educators from all three institutions to develop simulations that better prepare our future health professionals for community gaged work I see simulation as a way of scaffolding learning for students and practicing professionals to better prepare them for the complexities of community gauge practice. You can learn more about publicly engage scholarship but I U.P.D. why by contacting the office listed on the screen if you're interested in learning more about my story you can reach me poor at I You Healthy dot org or J A pour at you dot edu Thank you.    Description of the video:  Hi I'm easily would Professor of museum studies and associate dean for student affairs in the school for liberal arts and public scholars museums families and learning in this section I'll start to talk a little bit about perspectives on the unit level review committees for the promotion and tenure process. One of the most important things that can't be repeated enough is you use the guidelines the campus guidelines your school guidelines your department guidelines guidelines for publicly gave scholarship all of these guidelines are helpful for you in giving you the language that you need to use the strategies that you can take and the approaches that you need to follow in order to make the best case possible it's very important to think about how those guidelines are used by the campus level and also external reviewers because that's the information they have to make some determinations about your case if you only rely on peer examples you're really not giving yourself the best opportunity to document your process and to think about the work that you've done when you draw on the language of the school and campus level Pinti guidelines it helps you to substantiate your case and gives you the language that you need to document to demonstrate impact show the outcomes that you're complicating and the ways in which you have done that those guidelines have lots of Easter eggs in them and so the more that you pay attention to it the more that you think about what you can use to your advantage it will help you with the Ijaw CA format while it is already structured for you you can influence the kinds of things that you choose to put in each of the folders and how you can add additional material that may not be called for but makes a difference in terms of how you present your story use it to your best effect for example there's not a section specifically on public scholarship so I simply added a document under the research section that outlined all of my publicly engaged scholarship another thing that's important is for you to solicit feedback early and. Often And as much as possible from as many different people as possible especially people who've already gone through the process because they will understand the pitfalls and the different pathways that you may need to follow or things that you may not have paid attention to and finally you need to find allies they maybe inside were outside your department or school those are people who can understand look at the guidelines with you give you improve information and thoughtful feedback to help you understand how you are telling your story whether or not it makes sense and whether or not it aligns with the guidelines as you will hear a lot through this process your identity that you expressed in your dossier is critical to how you can be successful and aligning your express identity with the evidence that you provide in the da da is absolutely critical the ways in which you do this are really looking at your school's P and T document and that is a guide for the campus level reviewers but it's also a guide for external reviewers and you'll want to make sure that you're working within your unit for publically engage scholarship if it isn't already evident in the criteria some schools have been actively working towards developing these criteria in their documents but some don't and that's where you can use the campus level criteria to help you in terms of school level voting that's an important place where campus level reviewers are going to pay attention to the ways in which you've been able to advocate for yourself and demonstrate the work that you're doing with your peers at your school level and even in your department level so it's important to get school level support again working early to help people understand your identity especially as you think about the way the publicly gauge scholarship can bolster your case publicly gauge scholarship is often hard for campus level reviewers to understand in some cases and it's really up to you to help people understand clearly and effectively what it is that you're trying to accomplish and what you were able to achieve. As you continue to stink about your work your identity and the evidence you provide you need to be strategic and intentional about how you talk about the outcomes you were able to achieve the outcomes the impact the influence all of those types of things you're doing with community is important but you have to be careful about how you structure and define it the campus committee is often used to accounting method where they look at a number of presentations or products specifically like publications but you can be productive in your way of defining the types of outcomes that are important for the type of work that you do and align those with the public scholarship criteria that allows you to demonstrate that process and product is part of the work that you're documenting the more strategic you are about defining products in terms of how they meet community needs how they reflect academic and scholarly work in different arenas will help you demonstrate that the work you're doing matters to a wider group of people than might normally be and finally make sure that the documentation aligns with the identity in your product in your project even in thinking about what it is that you do so that you can document how what you did how you did it why you did it made a diff lastly as you continue through the process you'll want to think about how to identify your external reviewers assoon as you can while you don't get a chance to say who is for sure your external reviewer and you don't actually get to recruit them yourself you can identify the types of people who reflect the work that you've done the types of community partners that might be involved or other strategies that external review can take place think about how you would negotiate with partners to help them understand the process that you go through so that they have the best strategy to give input and feedback on your behalf think about looking for recognised people who conduct publically engage scholarship and other institutions who might review your work or even think about the types of people in external organisations that have achieved high levels of prominence that can provide a level of the Liberty to the work that you're doing.

Thank you for spending your day with us learning about our life path or journey of professional identity and openness. And so I want to start by sharing with you how I got to be who I am. In an effort to show you that there are many different hats to arrive to a similar destination. And so I have a confession. I do not start my company or my thinking, oh, I'm going to be a civically engaged or a health researcher. No. I did not know what that last when I started, I just wanted to be humble dentist. I wanted I always had an interest of helping people, of bringing them back to health or a health and specific. I always wanted to be a helper, but I didn't know how and I didn't know what would be my path to have the largest impact. It has been through learning with others and attending workshops like this, and finding allies and finding people who might mean that I came to define my professional identity efforts in so I start my career desk. This, I didn't know. I started my career by thanking them. Or health is a universal right. That in this day and age we can disagree how to pay for it, who has to pay for it? Who's responsible? But we have to start from the, from the universal value that right, oral health as a right. Starting with that, with that. Throughout my journey, I learned that if I'm going to be affected and in order to truly make an effect that change and make an impact, I needed to partner with my, my community. I needed to find out what those I wanted to help. That IBM Watson is this traditional model of Dr. Nelson at all. And I'm going to tell you what you need to do to get better. What's important for me? And it wasn't working for dentistry in general. We still had a lot of needs and so I started thinking maybe there's different way and maybe we can learn from our communities, from our patients. And through doing that, I'd arrive to the conclusion that that was a must. That if I wanted to have an influence at a larger level, that is what I needed to do. And so throughout my journey, somebody already shared that they've been doing this for 28 years. I can I can share with you that this is my third year as a dentist. I graduated dental school 30 years ago. And if you do the math to figure out how old I am going to be upset. That's how long I've been doing this. And so throughout those 30 years, I have to find what I do in I provide preventive services to my community, trying to learn what the community identifies as. Indeed, I teach that in public health and I conduct research and carries and Prevention in partnership with my community. And I'm here to tell you that there are different paths to do this within academia by working within the system or disrupting the system. My path has taken me, work with them, the system and to make those little changes or those large changes that I needed to push this new way of approaching professional development and approaching or you want to do. And so there's only 24 hours in the day. And the only way to do this is pursuing integration. And so I have integrated my activities and research, teaching and community engagement. I conduct research and has driven by community needs. I teach what I research, and then I singles and integrate my, my community activities didn't even go to the next slide is just a graphic illustration of how I started this journey and where I ended. So I started in private practice as a general dentist and then I moved to the safety net. So I make in the prison system in Mexico City. And then I realized that if I wanted to have a larger impact, I wanted to be an educator, a researcher. And so I moved into an academic role and I became an instructor that I became a professor. And I've been growing up to now where I'm a full professor. And along the way, I figure out that depending on who you ask, they will tell you, I have a gift of leadership or I really bus, you can, you can pick whichever one you like. And so I figured out that drew my my ability to become a leader. I could be an administrator and facilitate that change within the system. I also figure out that there are rather institutions outside of academia that have an impact on love with G. And so I'd become a consultant. I've become an advisor to the regional health equity network, to the Environmental Protection Agency, to the CDC in so I tried to tackle this new way of doing things from multiple avenues. And if we go to the last one, I would be totally lying to you if I didn't tell you that. That's how my life feels at times. I've I've wanted to tell you that. Yes, it is not easy. Any path we choose, not just as any path we choose. Going have to juggle everything. You're going to have to develop Athenians. You're going to have to come up with tactics and changing the script of how you're told things are done. But it is doable. It is to a bomb. You have to find others who think like you. What approach, thanks to the way, the way you want to approach them, learn from them, partner with them, and know, just bounce, bounce your life balance, what do you do? There will be, there will be a positive outcome if you do what you believe. And your partner will also help you get there. And key.  Description of the video:  For that, welcome everyone. So happy to be sharing this space with you this morning. This is a just have a couple of slides that sort of helped me to document the work that I do. Not only the work but the approach to the work. And of course, this first slide deals with my educational philosophy and my pedagogy. Essentially illustrating the fact that they stem from and are informed by a genealogy that we call in the culture we call it the African black intellectual tradition. Which is why it's at the center of this graphic. And that is a deep well-spring of Information. Stories, history, culture, tradition, heritage, all of those things and what I call a usable past on actionable pass. And these are things that they represent mythology and philosophy and history. And essentially the cultural assets that's sort of brain and hold people together and keep them bound. So what I do, the corpus or the wellspring of what I do sort of us comes from my interrogation of that space. The black intellectual tradition, introducing students to this as a genealogy. And I referred to it as a genealogy because it is a living thing with the Great West African philosopher hmm Patek Bach called a living tradition. So it is something that is very much alive. And we try to interrogate this in my work, in my research to have a relationship with these ideas and with these IBM makers. That is as, as, as immediate as the context of right now. So, and so I try to introduce and my work introduce students to this genealogy. Just the genealogy, but also the possibilities of that genealogy. I'm from Chicago, born and raised, been in Indianapolis now for about for just over four years. And so my work across the last 28 years has taken place in schools, communities, so-called juvenile detention centers in prisons. In working with these particular knowledge communities in these populations. Not just to unseat and disrupt deficit narratives about how they are perceived. Lacking resources, having subaltern, historical experiences, lacking assets and culture. But instead I take a different approach, a different tack. That is to honor and value of the folks in community spaces wherever their community happens to be. And actually for as a default position, seeing the value and seeing that cultural knowledge and the heritage knowledge that they bring to any learning opportunity, to any learning situation. So right off the bat, that's a different approach than is taken by a lot of people who would go into communities. And working with so-called marginalized populations is seeing them as blank slates or empty vessels in need of fixing. So that right there is a master narrative or racist narrative that I never really bought into at all. But it is something that I will have to work actively to unsee and disrupt the pre-service teachers that I encounter. I'm an assistant professor working teaching, researching, writing and the School of Education, Urban Teacher Ed Department and also in Africana studies. So that work summed up or described, we call it in the culture, a jagged. And jagged is a master teacher that comes out of the Amharic tradition. We can go to the next slide. And so did enter it. Interrelated zones of my work have to do with these three whirls, this pan African black intellectual tradition. Of course, these. And the thrust fuels this education for liberation. And the interrogation research writing that I do in the world of arts learning and arts pedagogy. So it's within those three spaces. And the interstitial spaces between those spaces that I do. The work that I do in schools and communities in different populations across the city and throughout the Midwest. Next slide, please. And of course you have to have a value system. As African people, everything that we've ever touched, we'd had a value system and a tradition set to away you talking about the hip hop movement or you're talking about any other global arts movement. It was always a system of values that fed it. And so this work around, along these culturally informed principals comes out of the research of the grandmaster Doctor Joyce came. And she's given us these wonderful values that we can use and utilize in order to build on the content and pedagogy. So these values are sort of threaded through all aspects of my work, my thinking, the theorizing that I do, the teaching, scholarship and these values are also deeply interwoven into my community engaged, community focused practices. So hopefully we'll get a chance, maybe during the breakout session to talk a little bit more about these in right there. Thank you. Thank you.  Description of the video:  Good morning everyone. Does. Lin and I am excited to be your first moderators today. And I would like to begin by tell them my public purpose story, my Publius story is quite interesting. When I began this work, I initially had just graduated from undergraduate. I went to knock it on an ansi and but I graduated. I had all the instances to be a news anchor. And as a young African-American, dark-skinned male, opportunity was not available for me at that time because I look every bit 16 and I did not match the ideal phase for the news demographics. Therefore, during that time I was, I will go to r this then different things and to just to try to get my exposure and opportunity. But I was an executive mainly because of how young I look and how my scandal was at the time and just, it just wasn't a market for me. And I found what about the AmeriCorps vista program? And as an AmeriCorps member, they taught me so much about public work and what it meant to be a transformational leader. And in this process, I gain a tremendous amount of experience that allow me to work with public groups, nonprofits, and S bill with was education and sees an end those educational entities, I was afforded the opportunity to create tutoring programs for the University of Chicago charter schools. Donahue and in his will, the opportunity to help Donahue charter school build their library. And his process. What really happened is I allowed myself to be immersed and the whole experience and again, opportunity to create community partners within this four to school and in as will I learned, the skill to be able to develop programs around and, and to collaborate with many people. And that's one reason why I say that my values are collaboration, fairness, accuracy, trustworthiness, and, and that all came from my early experiences and in public engagement. Now, over the last few years, I will say that I've been an educator and I taught in Chicago for five years. And my go in as a teacher is to always create a safe learning community for my students and buy that mostly always has what exactly is a safe learning community. And this is a place where students are actually allow to develop. And this is a place where students are allowed to have the opportunity to ask questions. No question is a question. We made Bill. So as teachers sometimes, but definitely it is dead. A place where students can feel safe to ask questions just so that they are gaining knowledge and an SDK participating in this process, as a community partner, always seek to promote equity and to support disadvantaged populations. By that, outbound is out had opportunity to live in five different states and different cities. And it is time. I've really see, but disadvantage looks like across to different areas and is really bad in many different places. So I always aim to kind of promote equity. And what brought me here to IU PUI was the fact that the American Studies program provide an opportunity for me to do research and an implement practice in in public work. And by doing so, since I've been here, I've xi1 programs such as crisp and John, also pronouns and currently now P of a P. But I was afforded the opportunity to host the equity and public work panel for graduate students here, IUP UI. And this conversation was lay it by a panel of black professionals that work in institutions in a city. And if you don't know an anchor news, an anchor institution is a city, is a organization in when they see that places like the values and so is our public service. You have IEP is anger Institute, IP you as anchor institutions, the hospital as an anchor institution, Eskenazi hill. These operations all focuses on public services for people in the city. And what these leaders there, they they all for their candid opinions and, and, and a provide a detail of their experiences in the field of diversity, inclusion and equity. Their jobs and they're letting, they were letting the scholars know what it looks like to be an African-American in this work. And what, what is the process of being an ally? What does it look like to be a partner in this practice? And in the process? It gave insight to those of us that want to do work in on our local levels and in just to facilitate some way and building a common ground. And also, I had the opportunity to create a youth awareness campaign in Chicago called tunnel for life. Tunnel for life serve as a platform for you, especially black males ages eight to 18, and is platform created opportunities for students to speak out against violence. And in this process, we were able to engage over 500 families to create safe environments for their children. And to also create a format for you to say they are against what's happening in their communities. So overall, as a student, I would offer opportunities for any of my peers to sit down and have a conversation with me or, and, or just think about the, what it means to really put a purpose toward your work and know that we want to now follow up. We've got the Kasim Bay and he can talk about his experiences with public service and public engagement. "

    "body": "  ## The will to make a difference  The civic-minded graduate (CMG) is a person who has completed a course of study and has the capacity and desire to work with others to achieve the common good. It refers to a person’s inclination or disposition to be knowledgeable of and involved in the community and to have a commitment to act upon a sense of responsibility as a member of that community.  To better understand the concept of civic-mindedness and to assess the extent to which students who graduate from IUPUI are civic-minded, staff from CSL developed the CMG model, which identifies the specific knowledge, skills, and dispositions to describe how students develop civic-mindedness. This model pulls from multiple disciplines, including, but not limited to, student development, social psychology, political and environmental science, and philanthropy.  The conceptual framework for the CMG represents the integration of the following three dimensions:  [Diagram for civic-minded graduate View the civic-minded graduate diagram.](https://indiana.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/msteams_92d57a/Ee9qlkpRDBRPnSnq3bLIPL8BpBNDMZQNxpYwj7RNJt7Rlg?e=hsmyca)   ### Diagram for civic-minded graduate  View the civic-minded graduate diagram.   ### Domains of the CMG construct   #### Knowledge   #### Skills   #### Dispositions   #### Behavioral intentions   ### Methods to measure the CMG construct  [CMG scale A quantitative self-report measure.](https://indiana.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/msteams_92d57a/EbnmxR9Xk2xJuRlwkiW2wLwBYIOBCAtQldkPnb3qu8PNGw?e=Ns40eq)   #### CMG scale  A quantitative self-report measure.

    "body": "  ## Tools and instruments for research and assessment  The goals of service learning and community engagement go beyond a desire to contribute positively to communities and to learning, but how do we know if these efforts are effective or that communities or students benefit?  Assessment, evaluation, and research are critical to demonstrating the effectiveness of these efforts to both academic and community stakeholders. The CSL has a longstanding commitment to developing evidence to support our work. Collectively, our work has led to the development of several frameworks and tools designed to study and to support the development of civic-mindedness among students and professionals. This commitment has also yielded systemic inquiry into the dimensions and relational outcomes of community-academic partnerships.  The results of these efforts have yielded longitudinal research on IUPUI students involved in service learning and deepened partnerships with organizations throughout Indianapolis and beyond. Use the links below to learn more about tools and instruments you can use when conducting research and assessment on service learning and community engagement.   ### Civic-minded graduate  The civic-minded graduate is a person who has completed a course of study and has the capacity and desire to work with others to achieve the common good.   ### Civic-minded professional  A civic-minded professional is one who is skillfully trained through formal education with the ethical disposition as a social trustee of knowledge and the capacity to work with others in a democratic way to achieve public good.   ### SOFAR model  Staff members have developed a graphic reflection and assessment process to support campuses and communities in improving communication and network building based on the SOFAR model of partnerships.   ### IUPUI service learning taxonomy  Based on an extensive literature review on service learning research and best practices, six essential attributes of service learning courses have been identified.   ### Previous program partnerships  Partnerships are at the heart of community engagement, CSL’s work, and IUPUI’s mission.   ### TRES scale  The Transformational Relationship Evaluation Scale (TRES) (V1. & V.2) were developed to support both the study of effective community-university partnerships as well as contribute to improving the practice of partnerships.   ### Publication and reports  Research publications and evaluation reports are available on the the center's ScholarWorks site.

    "body": "  ## Meet Ayomide Betiku  Ayomide Betiku, a May 2022 graduate from the School of Science at IUPUI, has now earned a bachelor's degree in biology with a minor in Africana studies. She participated in the Community Engagement Associate (CEA) Program under the mentorship of Dr. Patricia Turley.  As a CEA, Betiku served as a mentor for other students in two courses: AFRO-A 200 Research in African American and African Diaspora Studies and AFRO-A 364 Research on Contemporary Afro-American Problems II. She helped navigate the research process, unpack course materials, and supported students with research projects. Betiku’s research endeavors surpass guiding and mentoring students. This year she contributed to the larger body of research that enabled students to learn more about their family lineage.  Through the CEA program, Betiku worked on a project called Echoes of Our Ancestors. This project focuses on Black ancestry and the identification of common traditions and cultures within the African Diaspora. In this project, students could use their family lineage, culture, and traditions to identify ways in which they relate to the African Diaspora. Betiku notes that this project originated through working with other scholars in an effort to compile writings of family narratives. This writing collaboration revealed a way to connect back to the Diaspora.  Although the project was rewarding, Betiku had some difficulties with the process. For example, this was the first time Betiku was able to record some of her family narratives. She explained that it was challenging to ask questions and compile a story even though it was her own. With the help of her mentor, Betiku persevered through the challenges and grew both educationally and personally.  View Betiku's ePortfolio  [View Betiku's ePortfolio](https://www.thecn.com/AB2694)   ### Q & A with Ayomide Betiku   #### What is one thing you learned about yourself during your participation in the CEA Program?  One thing I learned about myself during my participation in the CEA program was that I could handle multiple things at once successfully, if I plan my schedule well. I was working on the CEA project, my classes, studying for the MCAT, preparing to graduate, and working on my senior capstone. I had so many things on my plate; however, I was able to succeed in all because of how I planned my schedule and managed my time.   #### What did your day-to-day look like as a CEA?  My day-to-day as a CEA included gathering data and information about my project and having meetings with my mentor.   #### What was the highlight of your time as a CEA?  The highlight of my time as a CEA was working with my mentor on our project that will be published and being able to present it with other students at the IUPUI research day.   #### What is one key takeaway you would like other students to know about your time as a CEA?  With the project I worked on with my mentor, I did not only work on it but also learned, which I believe will help me as I progress in my career. "

    "body": "  ## Strategies for Integrating Reflection  Reflection activities come in many varieties and span a variety of modalities. Frequently, educators focus on written reflection on written reflection strategies; however, there is increasing experimentation with other forms of reflection such as visual and performative varieties. The links below provide a brief overview of many common approaches.   ### Personal Journals  Personal journals are easy to assign, yet often difficult to grade. Some contend that this means of personal reflection should be graded only for completion. Personal journals provide a way for students to express thoughts and feelings about the service experience throughout the semester. Structured journals provide guidance so that students link personal learning with course content.  Critical incident journal: This journal includes a set of prompts that ask students to consider their thoughts and reactions and articulate the action they plan to take in the future: Describe a significant event that occurred as part of the service experience. Why was the event significant to you? What did you learn from this experience? How will this incident influence your future behavior? What new action steps will you take next time?  Three-part journal: Each page of the weekly journal entry is divided into thirds; description, analysis, application. In the top section, students describe some aspect of the service experience. In the middle section, students analyze how course content relates to the service experience. And in the application section, students comment on how the experience and course content can be applied to their personal or professional life.  Highlighted journal: Before students submit their reflective journal, they reread personal entries and, using a highlighter, mark sections of the journal that directly relate to concepts and terms discussed in the text or in class. This makes it easier for both the student and the instructor to identify the academic connections made during the reflection process.  Key-phrase journal: The instructor provides a list of terms and key phrases at the beginning of the semester for students to include in journal entries. Evaluation is based on the use and demonstrated understanding and application of the term.  Double-entry journal: Students describe their personal thoughts and reactions to the service experience on the left page of the journal and write about key issues from class discussion or readings on the right page of the journal. Students then draw arrows indicating relationships between their personal experience and course content.  Dialogue journal: Students submit loose-leaf journal pages to the instructor for comments every two weeks. While labor intensive for the instructor, this can provide regular feedback to students and prompt new questions for students to consider during the semester. Dialogue journals also can be read and responded to by a peer.   ### Directed Writings   ### Experiential Research Papers   ### Online Discussion   ### Ethical Case Studies   ### Service Learning Portfolios   ### Personal Narratives   ### Exit Cards   ### Class Presentations   ### Weekly Log "

This means that community members are not simply recipients of a product or service. Rather, intentional effort is invested by instructors, students, and community partners to co-design project goals, methods, and effectiveness.  Integrating community project planning in a community-engaged course, as opposed to one focused on community outreach, involves adjusting course and project design strategies to enhance both community and academic ownership for project outcomes.  Depending on your disciplinary background and experience, community project planning may seem like a daunting prospect and leave you wondering where and how to begin. Involving community voices in your project planning can take several forms.

    "body": "  ## Civic learning and democratic engagement  When we think of civic engagement as a part of college, many of us may think of  service learning, voter registration drives, or fundraising. However, civic engagement strategies to make social change can take many forms in the academic, personal, and professional lives of students, faculty and staff. What makes civic engagement experiences educationally meaningful?   ### Defining civic learning and democratic civic engagement  Civic learning is not the same as service-learning. While service-learning refers to a way of teaching and learning, civic learning refers to a meta-category of learning that includes: \" knowledge (e.g., historical, political, and civic knowledge that arises from both academic and community sources); skills (e.g., critical thinking communication, quantitative reasoning, public problem solving, civic judgement, civic imagination and creativity, collective action, coalition building, organizational analysis; and values (e.g., justice, inclusion, and full participation) (Saltmarsh 2005). Through developing our civic faculties, we cultivate our individual capacities to be active members of society; in addition, we develop an expanded notion of \"we, the people\" and the social commitments that binds us together to work toward human thriving locally and globally.  The following are some introductory resources to integrate civic learning into your courses and programs. Questions? Contact csl@iupui.edu.   ## Educating for democracy resources, including political engagement  In the preface of Civic Responsibility and Higher Education (2002) , former IU President Thomas Ehrlich defined civic engagement \"as working to make a difference in the civic life of our communities and developing the combination of knowledge, skills, values and motivation to make that difference. It means promoting the quality of life in a community, through both political and non-political processes.\"  The resources below offer pathways to support students in learning the skills for democratic civic engagement.

    "body": "  ## Models of Critical Reflection  For many educators unfamiliar with designing critical reflection activities and assignments, reflection is something that happens after an experience and that reflection is only appropriate for certain types of situations. In reality, critical reflection is a fundamental process of learning and meaning making. When getting srated it's important to keep the following in mind:  In light of this, it's useful to remember, what have been termed the \" 4 C's of Critical Reflection. \" [Eyler and Giles]     ## 4 C's of Critical Reflection   ### CONTINUOUS  Provide learning opportunities to reflect before, during, and after the experience. The most common error that designers make is to limit reflection until after the experience. Improvements in CR capacity improve with time, practice and scaffolding. When integrating only within a course but across a program of study in order to build capacity for metacognition and critical consiousness building. Remember anything is reflection worthy. It is helpful to use a pre-mid-post structure, relative to the unit of time [session, week, semester, etc.], that focuses learner attention on changes in thier assumptions and reasoning processes and on progress toward meeting objectives.   ### CONNECTED  Experience, including service and community-based experiences, bring theories, concepts and statistics to life in palpable, contextualized and unscripted ways. Effective designers of CR, make sure to draw clear connections between the experiences and the frame/lens through that should be applied to the experience. Designers can use a variety of means to communicate the connection between academic content, as well as, other categories of learning [ professional, civic, personal, etc.] and \"the experience\" [e.g. syllabus, assignment instructions, lecture, etc.]   ### CHALLENGING  Critical Reflection requires stretching learners outside of thier comfort zone to explore more difficult or challenging questions. It requires that the facilitator balance challenging learners while creating a supportive, safe space for learners to express doubt, frustration, and inspriation.   ### CONTEXTUALIZED  The mode of reflection/reflection mechanism should reflect the setting, be scaffolded appropriate to the learner.

    "body": "  ## Meet Samantha Riley  Samantha Riley is a second-year Master of Arts in Applied Anthropology student in the IU School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI. During Sam’s first academic year in her graduate program (2020–2021), she participated in the Community Engagement Associate (CEA) Program under the mentorship of Dr. Susan Hyatt, professor of anthropology . The CEA Program employs students under the mentorship of faculty and staff to provide support for courses, programs, or projects that advance the community engagement mission of IUPUI.  [the Community Engagement Associate (CEA) Program](https://csl.iupui.edu/programs/community-engagement-associate-program/index.html)  [Dr. Susan Hyatt, professor of anthropology](https://liberalarts.iupui.edu/departments/anthropology/directory/susan-hyatt/)  As a CEA, Sam assisted Dr. Hyatt’s Urban Anthropology course. Sam and Dr. Hyatt applied the learning outcome of the course and incorporated a real-world situation that was happening at the time, the COVID-19 pandemic, into the course curriculum. In the course, students actively researched past epidemics and how they affected cities’ infrastructure to predict what cities will look like post COVID-19.  Sam and Dr. Hyatt knew they wanted to showcase their students’ work, but they did not know how to do so with IUPUI being mostly remote. After some research and inspiration from other universities and other faculty members, they pinpointed web presence as their goal. They set their sight on building a website to display their Urban Anthropology students’ work in hopes of documenting this defining period in history and spreading important and thought-provoking topics related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Although Sam has never built a website before, she learned how to navigate WordPress quickly through her own troubleshooting and built covidandthecity.org to bring her mentor’s and her vision to the web. The website highlights the students’ bios, their individual experiences with the pandemic, their relationship with the city before and during the pandemic, and their perception of what the city will look like post-pandemic.  [covidandthecity.org](https://www.covidandthecity.org/)  Sam is currently working at the Indianapolis VA Medical Center and has used the website building skills she learned in her CEA project to build a website for her study at the medical center. During this academic year, she is looking forward to adding new skills to her tool kit, wrapping up her thesis, and assisting with Dr. Hyatt’s ethnographic field course in spring 2022 under the CEA program.  You can visit the website Covid and the City to view Sam's final project.  [Visit Covid and the City](https://covidandthecity.org)   ### Q & A with Sam   #### What is one thing you learned about yourself during your participation in the CEA Program?  Before working on this project, I thought I was a slow learner. However, when I was building the website through WordPress, I had to learn that skill on the fly. I overcame that hurdle relatively quickly and picked up the skills I needed as I worked on the project.   #### What did your day-to-day look like as a CEA?  I looked through literature, websites, and resources to send to students, which helped them with their own research projects for the class. I also reached out to guest speakers to bring to our class Zoom calls. I also worked on the Covid and the City website.   #### What was the highlight of your time as a CEA?  Dr. Hyatt served as a mentor for the CEA program and as my graduate advisor. She provided me with a lot of support, resources, and ideas. We had a collaborative approach on my tasks and projects. I learned a lot from her help and support.   #### What is one key takeaway you would like other students to know about your time as a CEA?  At first, I thought this would be difficult to add on top of my graduate coursework. I learned that being a CEA added to my course learning and expanded my knowledge of this field. It was also a wonderful way to build a relationship with faculty and staff within my field. "

The real-world settings and issues that communities confront provide both a focal point and a backdrop for learning and change to occur.  Building authentic relationships with community residents, organizations, and groups, however, often challenges deeply held assumptions among all parties involved in community-university projects and collaborations. Overcoming these challenges requires that instructors, partners, and students examine their beliefs and practices through reflection, dialogue, and an openness to view questions from alternative standpoints. In particular, university engagement in the community raises a host of questions including:  When instructors, partners, and students make sincere efforts to find a common understanding of their goals, practices, and processes, many of the potential misunderstandings that can arise through collaboration can be mitigated.

Reflection is the intentional consideration of an experience in light of particular learning objectives. Reflection should be both retrospective and prospective: students consider their service experience in order to influence their future action. Effective reflection activities are linked to particular learning objectives of the class, are guided by the instructor, occur regularly throughout the course, allow for feedback and assessment, and include opportunities for the clarification of values. When reflection activities are integrated into class discussion and appear on exams, students report higher levels of satisfaction with the course and greater academic gains from the experience.

Many disciplines have clearly articulated how civic learning relates to their disciplines (e.g., social responsibility, altruism), while others are developing this evidence and these messages.  CSL staff are prepared to help you clearly articulate what it means for a graduate to be a civic-minded professional within your discipline—what knowledge, skills, and attitudes are necessary, and most important, how to assess student development of these capacities.   ### Institutional data  The Office of Institutional Research and Decision Support routinely administers surveys to students and faculty/staff and often collaborates with CSL to include items related to service learning and community engagement. The results (e.g., dashboards, publications) are useful in CSL planning, program improvement, and scholarship. These surveys include:  [Office of Institutional Research and Decision Support](http://irds.iupui.edu/)   ### Institutional instruments  Additional instruments used to assess community engagement are available through other organizations:  [California State University’s Center for Community Engagement](https://calstate.edu/cce/)  [Campus Compact](http://www.compact.org/)  [Community-Campus Partnerships for Health (CCPH)](https://ccphealth.org/)  [IUPUI](http://www.iupui.edu/)  [Michigan State University’s National Collaborative for the Study of University Engagement (NCSUE)](https://ncsue.msu.edu/)  [National Service-Learning Clearinghouse](https://www.nylc.org/) "

Public scholarship is scholarly work that advances one or more academic disciplines by emphasizing the co-production of knowledge with community stakeholders.  Public Scholarship at IUPUI (2016)  [Public Scholarship at IUPUI (2016)](https://scholarworks.iupui.edu/handle/1805/9713)  The practices that generated public scholarship are nested within what higher education scholars refer to as “next generation scholarship.” Next generation scholarship is fundamentally collaborative, transdisciplinary, and increasingly digital in nature. By its nature, public scholarship is always collaborative, minimally interdisciplinary, maximally transdisciplinary, and increasingly digital.  IUPUI is committed to attracting and retaining faculty oriented to and skilled in the practices of public scholarship. A growing body of research suggests that next generation approaches, like publicly engaged scholarship, will become an increasing part of the 21st century scholarly enterprise driven by generational shifts in faculty composition, increasing demand for knowledge that addresses complex problems, institutional goals for student learning success, and a host of questions related to public accountability.
