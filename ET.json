    "body": "  ### Graduate Certificate in Energy Management and Assessment  The potential benefits of energy efficiency are tremendous. According to the National Action Plan for Energy Efficiency, more than half of expected growth in demand for electricity and natural gas can be avoided over the next 15 years. Globally, new energy efficiency standard, ISO 50001, has been established and implemented. Accordingly, the Department of Energy (DOE) has developed Superior Energy Performance (SEP) criteria. The companies certified by the ISO 50001 and achieve further improved energy performance may be granted with the SEP status, which will give the companies tremendous advantages to do business globally. The implementation of this new international standard and concept requires a workforce with an expertise in energy management and efficiency. Experts in energy efficiency will be greatly needed for improving energy efficiency, energy auditing, ISO 50001and SEP certification.  This certificate program is designed to address industry's increased needs for engineers who have expertise in energy management and efficiency.

Mechanical engineering graduate students and practicing engineers who joined the workforce after received an engineering bachelor’s degree with working experience in energy systems would be interested in obtaining training on these new technologies. Therefore, to be eligible, an applicant needs to be an existing graduate student in our Mechanical Engineering Programs, or the fourth year students in our combined BS and MS program, or an engineer in industry. If the engineer has training from disciplines other than Mechanical Engineering, working experience on energy systems will be required. One year experience on energy systems will meet this requirement.  What are the requirements to complete the graduate certificate program?  1. Total requirement: 12 credit hours  2. GPA requirements  a. Minimum overall GPA  Successful completion of the certificate requires at least a B average over all courses counting towards the certificate.  b. Minimum grade:  Courses with a grade of C- or less must be taken again to count towards the certificate. The minimum grade that will be accepted in any single course is C. For transfer credits only the courses taken that result in a grade of B or better may be transferred for this certificate program.  3. Curriculum  There are four courses specifically designed for this certificate program:  Are there on-line options for these courses?  Yes. The majority of the graduate courses are offered in late afternoon hours to accommodate the needs of part-time students. In addition, a number of course lectures may be available in both live lecture and online via video streaming modes.  Will any of these four courses count toward a graduate degree?  Yes! All four courses may be used toward the requirements for a graduate degree in mechanical engineering, if you wish to pursue a formal degree program.  What are the requirements for admission to the certificate program?  In order to be eligible for this certificate program, the students must have a bachelor's degree from an accredited institution in an area which provides the necessary mathematical preparation for an engineering degree with a minimum undergraduate GPA of 3.0 out of 4.0. A conditional admission may be offered for applicants not meeting this criterion who have superior overall credentials. Applicants with non-engineering degrees, including mathematics, physical sciences, and engineering technology, may be required to take undergraduate mechanical engineering courses before admission to the program. Appropriate work experience also will be taken into account in making decisions about admission. Students will be required to submit a statement of interest and three letters of recommendation. A minimum TOEFL score of 550 (paper based) / 77 (internet based) or higher is required for international applicants whose native language is not English. Applicants taking IELTS must score at least 6.5 on the academic module.  Students admitted directly to the Purdue University graduate program can be considered for this certificate program, provided the student formally applies for the certificate program and receives admission. Courses completed under certificate program are not automatically transferred to a graduate degree program, unless the student makes a petition to the graduate committee in respective departments. A student already enrolled in a graduate degree program may complete the certificate irrespective of his / her major so long as the requirements of the certificate are fulfilled.  I have completed a few graduate courses in the past. Can I use the credits toward the certificate program?  If you have already earned credits for one or more of the equivalent courses from another institution or another certificate program, you may request to transfer up to a maximum of three credits of these courses toward this certificate. A maximum of 6 equivalent credit hours taken prior to admission to the certificate program, including 3 credit hours taken from another institution, may be counted towards the certificate. The rest of the courses must be completed at IUPUI within a three-year period from the time of admission. Any waivers or substitutions require approval. No undergraduate courses can be applied to this certificate program.  How do I apply for admission to the certificate program?  To apply for admission, contact Monica Stahlhut, MEE Graduate Programs Assistant by telephone at (317) 278-4960 or by email: mstahlhu@iupui.edu .

The two best for our Students are the STEM Career and Intern Fair, held at IUPUI, and the Industrial Roundtable, held at Purdue West Lafayette, September 12-14. Be sure to see if there are career fairs specific to your major, like the Construction Management career fair at Purdue West Lafayette, on September 29.  [Industrial Roundtable,](https://www.purdueesc.org/employers/industrial-roundtable-information)  [Construction Management](https://polytechnic.purdue.edu/schools/construction-management-technology/career-resources/cmt-career-fair)  How to Work a Career Fair  A career fair is a networking event with employers for internships, co-ops, and full-time positions. It gives you a chance to market your skills, abilities, education, and experience. You also have the opportunity to obtain information from the employer to secure an interview.  Before the Fair  Elevator Pitch  When you meet with a Recruiter, know what you will say. A good example of this is:  \"Hi, my name is John Doe, and I'm a Mechanical Engineering student at the Purdue School of Engineering and Technology at IUPUI, graduating in May 2023. I'm looking for a summer internship and am interested in XYZ Company because of their innovative work on locomotive engines. \"  End this opening with a pause to see if they have questions about your background. If they don't, ask them a question such as \"can you tell me about your internship program\" to keep the conversation going.  LinkedIn Profile  Yes, you need one. It helps employers put a face with a name after meeting you at a career fair. It also gives them a way to contact you and could lead to job opportunities. Make sure to include the information (keep it updated!) from your resume on your profile and a professional picture.  Dress the Part  Professional business attire is encouraged.   ## In-Person Fair  What Should You Bring  In the event you attend an in-person career fair, be prepared by bringing the following:  Also be sure to go to Handshake to see which employers will be in attendance.   #### Attend a Workshop or Meet With Us  Throughout the months of August and September our office offers several opportunities for you to attend workshops on how to prepare for the career fairs. Be sure to check out our events listings to find the next available one.  If you are unable to attend a workshop but would like to prepare, schedule an appointment with us and we would be happy to get you career fair ready.  Schedule an Appointment "

    "body": "  ## Congratulations to our 2021 School of Engineering and Technology Graduates!  Congratulations to our School of Engineering and Technology's Class of 2021! We are proud of each and every one of you, and know you will go far in life!  Check back on Friday, May 14th on our social media channels for a virtual celebration with a message from Dean Russomanno and some of our 2021 graduates!  For a list of graduates and downloadable recognition booklet, click here .  Description of the video:  Hello, I am David Russomanno, dean of the School of Engineering and Technology at IUPUI. On behalf of our entire School, I extend a warm welcome to our graduates, as well as their family and friends.  This spring 2020 semester has been an unprecedented time given the COVID-19 pandemic. Our graduates’ persistence and dedication through it all has been truly remarkable.  Just as we are energized each fall by the return of students to campus, we are very proud and optimistic about the future as we celebrate the accomplishments of our graduates this spring.  Shortly after I arrived on campus as dean about 10 years ago, I challenged our School’s faculty and staff using 3 themes:  Compete and succeed at the highest levels  Strive for excellence in our core mission of teaching, research, and service  Enhance our image and reputation  These 3 themes are highlighted throughout our School’s strategic plan. These 3 themes are also very relevant to the graduates we celebrate today.  Compete at the highest levels:  Competition, when applied and interpreted appropriately will bring out the best in all of us. I challenge each of our new graduates to strive to compete at the highest levels as your success is critical to improving our world.  Strive for excellence:  It is no secret that we have some of the most demanding degree programs of any School on any college campus. All of our graduates are highly commended for your persistence to achieve the milestone in your lives that we celebrate today.  However, you must not rest on your laurels. You have the foundation required for life-long learning in a rapidly changing, highly complex world. Apply and extend the knowledge you have acquired wisely as you strive for excellence.  As you receive your Purdue or Indiana University degree it signifies a credential and a life-long connection to our School here at IUPUI. Also, think of it as a dividend paying stock, which you can never sell, but you can benefit from its increasing dividends over a lifetime.  The School of Engineering and Technology’s strategic plan is designed to enhance our image and reputation. Our bottom line success means increasing the value of your degree. We are continuously striving to increase its dividend.  All of our new alumni share a responsibility for enhancing our School’s image and reputation. How can you help?  First, be successful in your chosen profession. Exceed the expectations of those around you.  Second, stay connected with our School. Initially this connection may be made by sending that email to your favorite professor about how you have applied some knowledge gained in a class, or speaking to a prospective student or parent about your experience at IUPUI.  Perhaps you will visit a class to provide input, or take on a leadership role within our School’s alumni association.  Later, but we hope sooner than later, find a way to give back in other ways too. And, once you get settled in your career, or sell some of those other stocks, think about your legacy and consider establishing a named scholarship to provide opportunities for future students.  Who knows, perhaps IUPUI will recognize the naming of our School of Engineering and Technology after one of our graduates we celebrate here today.  By giving back through your time, talent, and treasure, you will invest in your stock and increase its dividend, helping both yourself, as well as the others that will follow you.  The Purdue or IU degree that you have earned gives you a solid foundation upon which to truly make your mark.  I challenge and encourage you to build on that foundation, to enhance your image and reputation.  In short, continue to make us proud of you and your many accomplishments.  Compete at the highest levels … Strive for excellence … Enhance image and reputation  These themes exemplify the standard of excellence that will advance the engineering and technology programs at IUPUI to national and international prominence.  As I conclude, I hope that you—as a graduate—will use these themes to guide the future directions in your career.  Don’t worry:  there won’t be a quiz after today’s celebration.  However, you will continue to face some of life’s toughest tests as you have this spring through the pandemic—but I know your education has equipped you well for success as you face the challenges that lie ahead.  I’m confident that later in life, as you reflect back on your successful career, you will say that it all began in the School of Engineering and Technology at IUPUI.  I look forward to keeping in touch with each of you, and we hope that your involvement in our School will continue long after celebrations conclude.  Congratulations, again, to all class of 2020 graduates from the School of Engineering and Technology.   ### Keep in touch!

The demand for expert in the area will increase as the natural resource of energy is depleting. Energy Engineering (EEN) is the discipline that will deal with the challenge, which can shape the life of our future generation.  EEN advances knowledge in conventional and renewable energy, energy resources, energy analysis, efficiency improvement and energy storage system technology.  EEN students are finding exciting new ways to extract and use energy efficiently and sustainably. EEN includes the design of solar and wind power plants, fuel-cell and hybrid cars, safer nuclear power plants and more energy-efficient homes and industrial processes.  We have a finite supply of energy resources. Our response: find ways to use these resources more efficiently and develop new sources for energy.  Energy engineers discover valuable renewable energy sources that free us from dependency on quickly-depleting materials. They reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are hazardous to humans and the environment. And they eliminate waste by making our world more energy-efficient.  This broad field of engineering deals with energy efficiency, energy services, facility management, environmental compliance and alternative energy technologies. Energy engineers creatively apply their knowledge of science (physics and chemistry), engineering (electrical and mechanical) and economics to confront the global challenges of energy supply and demand.

    "body": "  ## Overview of Biomedical Engineering   #### What is Biomedical Engineering?  Biomedical Engineering (BME) is a discipline that advances knowledge in engineering, biology, and medicine to improve human health through cross-disciplinary activities integrating the engineering sciences with biomedical sciences and clinical practice. Students work in the development of new devices, algorithms, processes, and systems that advance biology and medicine and improve medical practice and health care delivery. Many students chose BME because it is people-oriented.  Perhaps the most archetypical BME device is the cardiac pacemaker which senses the patient's current heart rhythm and rate and will electrically stimulate the heart to regularize an abnormal rate or rhythm.  Read more about Biomedical Engineering   #### Is Biomedical Engineering right for me?  When you enter any engineering discipline you must have a strong interest in science and mathematics in a way that allows you to solve problems of a highly technical nature. For BME you must be willing to add the life sciences and medical knowledge necessary to understand the frame work of the problems on which you will work.  More Information to Help You Decide   ### Biomedical Engineering at IUPUI  Biomedical engineering is the newest engineering department at IUPUI. BME provides cutting edge facilities and an extraordinary learning environment. Department faculty cover many areas including orthopaedic biomechanics, cardiovascular instrumentation, medical imaging, biomaterials, molecular engineering, biosensors, neurosciences, and tissue engineering.  More on Biomedical Engineering at IUPUI   ### Our Vision  The vision of the Biomedical Engineering Department is to be a global leader in biomedical engineering research and education. Our faculty, staff and students work together as a team to complete our missions of progressive and innovative biomedical research; excellence in graduate and undergraduate education; and service to the field of biomedical engineering.   #### Our Mission  The mission of the Biomedical Engineering Department is to strive to attain world-class research and to provide the highest quality educational experience for our students. We expect and value excellence conducting research, and training students to participate in research activities and professional practice.  We accomplish our Mission as follows:   #### Commitment to Engineering Education  Design and ethics are cornerstones of the biomedical engineering experience at IUPUI. By incorporating analyses, discussions, and projects over these topics, our students walk away as strong, ethically conscious engineers. To further these ideals, our department has been awarded a Department Enhancement Grant to fund these projects and learning initiatives.  Design  Starting sophomore year, students will be presented with multiple design projects throughout their college careers. While working in a team, each group of students will complete a design challenge, giving deliverables and completing milestones along the way. These projects are meant to hone the design capabilities of each student while improving teamwork skills in preparation for the two-semester senior capstone project.  Ethics  To further ethics instruction, students are presented with circumstances that question engineering ethics in their BME courses. The type of circumstance ranges from criticizing an ethical engineering decision to including ethical analyses in senior capstone projects. Speakers from engineering professions are also brought in to discuss how engineering ethics impacts their daily lives as well as those surrounded by their profession. "

    "body": "  ## Congratulations to our 2020 School of Engineering and Technology Graduates!  Congratulations to our School of Engineering and Technology's Class of 2020! In light of the canceled School of Engineering and Technology School Recognition Ceremony and the postponement of the IUPUI Commencement Ceremony, we have compiled some messages from each of our departments and some of our students. We are proud of each and every one of you, and know you will go far in life!  Check our social media channels for a virtual celebration with a message from Dean Russomanno and some of our 2020 graduates!  For a list of graduates and downloadable recognition booklet, click here .  Description of the video:  Hello, I am David Russomanno, dean of the School of Engineering and Technology at IUPUI. On behalf of our entire School, I extend a warm welcome to our graduates, as well as their family and friends.  This spring 2020 semester has been an unprecedented time given the COVID-19 pandemic. Our graduates’ persistence and dedication through it all has been truly remarkable.  Just as we are energized each fall by the return of students to campus, we are very proud and optimistic about the future as we celebrate the accomplishments of our graduates this spring.  Shortly after I arrived on campus as dean about 10 years ago, I challenged our School’s faculty and staff using 3 themes:  Compete and succeed at the highest levels  Strive for excellence in our core mission of teaching, research, and service  Enhance our image and reputation  These 3 themes are highlighted throughout our School’s strategic plan. These 3 themes are also very relevant to the graduates we celebrate today.  Compete at the highest levels:  Competition, when applied and interpreted appropriately will bring out the best in all of us. I challenge each of our new graduates to strive to compete at the highest levels as your success is critical to improving our world.  Strive for excellence:  It is no secret that we have some of the most demanding degree programs of any School on any college campus. All of our graduates are highly commended for your persistence to achieve the milestone in your lives that we celebrate today.  However, you must not rest on your laurels. You have the foundation required for life-long learning in a rapidly changing, highly complex world. Apply and extend the knowledge you have acquired wisely as you strive for excellence.  As you receive your Purdue or Indiana University degree it signifies a credential and a life-long connection to our School here at IUPUI. Also, think of it as a dividend paying stock, which you can never sell, but you can benefit from its increasing dividends over a lifetime.  The School of Engineering and Technology’s strategic plan is designed to enhance our image and reputation. Our bottom line success means increasing the value of your degree. We are continuously striving to increase its dividend.  All of our new alumni share a responsibility for enhancing our School’s image and reputation. How can you help?  First, be successful in your chosen profession. Exceed the expectations of those around you.  Second, stay connected with our School. Initially this connection may be made by sending that email to your favorite professor about how you have applied some knowledge gained in a class, or speaking to a prospective student or parent about your experience at IUPUI.  Perhaps you will visit a class to provide input, or take on a leadership role within our School’s alumni association.  Later, but we hope sooner than later, find a way to give back in other ways too. And, once you get settled in your career, or sell some of those other stocks, think about your legacy and consider establishing a named scholarship to provide opportunities for future students.  Who knows, perhaps IUPUI will recognize the naming of our School of Engineering and Technology after one of our graduates we celebrate here today.  By giving back through your time, talent, and treasure, you will invest in your stock and increase its dividend, helping both yourself, as well as the others that will follow you.  The Purdue or IU degree that you have earned gives you a solid foundation upon which to truly make your mark.  I challenge and encourage you to build on that foundation, to enhance your image and reputation.  In short, continue to make us proud of you and your many accomplishments.  Compete at the highest levels … Strive for excellence … Enhance image and reputation  These themes exemplify the standard of excellence that will advance the engineering and technology programs at IUPUI to national and international prominence.  As I conclude, I hope that you—as a graduate—will use these themes to guide the future directions in your career.  Don’t worry:  there won’t be a quiz after today’s celebration.  However, you will continue to face some of life’s toughest tests as you have this spring through the pandemic—but I know your education has equipped you well for success as you face the challenges that lie ahead.  I’m confident that later in life, as you reflect back on your successful career, you will say that it all began in the School of Engineering and Technology at IUPUI.  I look forward to keeping in touch with each of you, and we hope that your involvement in our School will continue long after celebrations conclude.  Congratulations, again, to all class of 2020 graduates from the School of Engineering and Technology.  Description of the video:  I want to take a moment to offer a special congratulations to the many CIT and CGT graduates here today who are the first generation in their families to graduate from college. What a remarkable achievement.  No matter how unconventional this commencement event is, today is still a day of celebration. A day to celebrate all the hard work in Information Technology or Graphics Technology that got you to this moment.  Today is still a day of thanks. A day to thank those who helped you get here—nurtured you, taught you, cheered you on, and dried your tears.  Today is a day of reflection. Because today marks the end of one era of your life and the beginning of something new.  You have the whole world in front of you. I can’t wait to see what you do with it. Congratulations, and Go CIGT!  Description of the video:  Dear Graduating Students in the Department of Engineering Technology,  I am honored to speak to you as you end your time at IUPUI and begin a new chapter of your life.  Although we aren’t having an official commencement ceremony this year, it’s important to recall that the word “commencement” speaks to a beginning, and not an end.  Throughout your years at IUPUI, you have hopefully been pushed to expand your horizons to help prepare you for this next phase.  I expect that you have spent many a long day completing a project or preparing for an exam.  In parallel, faculty in each of the seven academic programs in the department have also dedicated countless hours to support your academic progress, along with staff who have worked with you in the lab or advised you as you complete your plan of study.  Your success is really a team effort.  When students, faculty and staff work together towards student success, the results are often amazing, and from what I’ve seen as the Department Chair, we are graduating some truly extraordinary people this year.  You will be entering a world that is unlike anything any of us have ever experienced.  Just like you are entering a new phase of your life, the world around us is also experiencing significant changes. We are all being presented with not only grand challenges but also grand opportunities.  This is not a time to shrink.  This is a time to stand tall.  As the civil rights activist and singer Bernice Johnson Reagon once said, “Life's challenges are not supposed to paralyze you, they're supposed to help you discover who you are”.  You would not have graduated from this university, from this campus, from this school, from this department, and from your program of study unless you were able to demonstrate knowledge, skills, and competencies of value to society.  You have not only learned, you have also learned how to learn, so you can adapt to whatever changes society experiences.  So let this be the time that you vow to accept what is, improve what can be changed, and embrace the challenges that lie ahead.  Don’t let a rocky path deter you, for it is still a path.  The Department of Engineering Technology is proud to recognize our Class of 2020!  Description of the video:  Dear Graduates in the Class of 2020,  On behalf of the faculty and staffs of the Department of Mechanical and Energy Engineering, it is my pleasure to congratulate you for the job well-done. You made it through your hard work and persevence, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic in the spring semester, 2020. You earn it which is evidenced by your academic accomplishments. With a Purdue degree, you are well-positioned to compete for your dream jobs in the areas of mechanical and energy engineering. You are well-equipped for continuing to build your career of your choice including working in industry, research institutes, or academics. The faculty and staffs of the department are wishing you well. Please keep in touch. We are looking forward to hearing your successful stories. The Department of Mechanical and Energy Engineering is proud to recognize our Class of 2020.  Description of the video:  Dear graduating students from the Department of Music and Arts Technology. Congratulations on successfully completing the most innovative, forward thinking music program in the United States. You have mastered a multitude of musical and technical skills, preparing you for careers that are available today (breathe) and providing the foundation for success (pause) in professions and careers that do not yet exist. You may find positions in sound production, audio engineering, acoustical design, as a media and event specialist, a studio manager, or a multimedia specialist. You may find your passion developing new, innovative music software or new musical instruments. You may even design a better real time performance art interface than Zoom.  Whatever your future brings, the music and arts technology faculty are very proud of your hard work and dedication to your degree. It has certainly not been easy. Even without a pandemic, music studies are traditionally some of the most difficult degrees to complete, with long hours of ensemble rehearsal and private practice striving for perfection. We even expected you to do a little math. Hopefully, your rehearsals, time in the CLEAR lab, relaxing in the lounge between classes, have helped you establish relationships during your time at IUPUI that will stay with you as you move on with your goals and aspirations. Always remember how you felt when you couldn’t be together, engage in random but, meaningful conversations, and collaborate on projects by tearing things apart and finding new ways to put them together. Those relationships with your peers are important as you move forward with your career and life. I know that you have influenced the MAT faculty, watching you struggle, watching you succeed, watching you master the competencies needed to thrive. So, thank you. Thank you for being you. Thank you for trusting us to guide your learning, for asking hard questions, for your curiosity. Thank you for making us all better. Good luck and godspeed.  Description of the video:  Greetings Graduates!  On behalf of the all the faculty and staff with the Department of Technology Leadership and Communication CONGRATULATIONS!  The graduating class of 2020 has certainly lived through some extraordinary times.  A worldwide pandemic, the conversion of all courses to online delivery, the cancellation of all on campus activities, and the complete restructuring of society as we know it. Clearly, this has been a difficult time for many of you, and we know that your struggles to complete the Master’s or Bachelor’s degree in organizational leadership or technical communication, were often difficult these past few months.  But the fact is, you all stepped up, and got it done.  We thank you for your grit, your passion, your willingness to adapt, and your tenacity to finish this journey.  And we commend you for your contributions to the university, the campus, the school and the department as you have persisted to your degree.  Our expectation for the organizational leadership degree requires all students to discover, connect, explore, and lead.  As I look back at each of our graduates, it is clear that you have achieved these four requirements throughout your academic careers, but especially during this final semester.  Graduates of our Technical Communication degree program are required to create, collaborate and communicate.  Certainly students achieving this degree have accomplished these three important elements of learning, and have put these skills to use during their final semester as well.  I challenge the class of 2020 to move forward with optimism, love, and a sense of accomplishment for the greater good.  Put your newfound leadership and communication skills to good use, and make this world a little better place by your very existence.  And please reach out if the TLC department can be of assistance.  We are here for today and always, as you are now and forever a part of the TLC family of graduates.   #### A dream realized deserves a day to celebrate.

    "body": "  ## Recent Research Seminars  The designing of MoO 2 /MoS 2 nanomaterials for next-generation LIBs  Dr. Shan Hu Post-doc research associate, School of Engineering Technology, Purdue University  Abstract  The ever-increasing energy demand and environmental deterioration exert huge pressure on the global energy infrastructure. Renewable-energy technologies, such as lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), and solar cells, have made a significant progress. LIBs have been widely applied in consumer electronics, automotive market, and grid for their high energy/power density and durable cycle life. Currently, most lithium-ion battery electrode materials have the disadvantages of poor stability, weak safety, unreasonable cycle life, which is difficult to meet the requirements for the next-generation LIBs. It is highly desirable to develop new anode candidates with high energy density, long cycling life, as well as environmental friendliness. Transition-metal chalcogenides (TMCs) have attracted tremendous attention for its multitude of possible valence states, stoichiometric compositions, and crystal structure. Compared with their oxide counterparts, TMCs usually exhibit better electrical conductivity, and thermal and mechanical stability. However, TMC materials undergo serious volume changes during the cycling process, which results in poor cycle stability.  In this presentation, we will discuss our recent progress on designing the molybdenum oxide, sulfide and their lithium storage capability. First, we will show the optimum designed MoO 2 -RGO composites which result in an enhanced specific capacity and cycling stability compared to commercial MoO 2 . Next, we will introduce the synthesis of the flower-like carbon coated MoS 2 via hydrothermal method and annealing treatment. The desired multilayered sheet structure improves high reversible capacity, good rate capability, and cyclic stability, making it a promising anode for high-performance LIBs. Last, we will introduce the controllable fabrication of MoS 2 nanocrystals embedded in mesoporous carbon nanofibers via electrospinning method. These mesoporous nanofibers demonstrate improved interfacial charge-transfer kinetics and a robust microstructure which result in a high reversible capacities and excellent cycling stability. Such micro-/nanoscale design and engineering strategies may also be used to explore other nanocomposites to boost their energy storage performance.  About the Speaker  Dr. Shan Hu is currently a post-doctoral research associate in School of Engineering Technology of Purdue University working with Prof. Jason Ostanek. She received her master and PhD degree in Wuhan University of Technology in 2016 and she worked as a joint PhD student in Prof. Guozhong Cao’s group of University of Washington from 2012 to 2014. Then she started postdoctoral researcher in Purdue University in the group of Prof. Gary Cheng from 2016 to 2018. She has extensive expertise in the nano energy materials and electrochemical energy storage system. In particular, she has developed high-performance ultra-thin MoS 2 nanosheets for advanced lithium ion batteries using a facile hydrothermal method. Her work has been published in Journal of Materials Chemistry A, Journal of Physics Chemistry C, Chemistry-A European Journal, Nanoscale etc. The paper entitled “Preparation of carbon coated MoS 2 flower-like nanostructure with self-assembled nanosheets as high-performance lithium-ion battery anodes”, which was published on the Journal of Materials Chemistry A, has been cited 145 times since 2014. And she has published 13 articles with total citations over 400 which is showing a broad impact on the materials science and engineering community. "

    "body": " What are they, how to get them, and why they are useful?  Internships are an opportunity for students to get hands-on experience in the field of their choice. They offer real-world work experience, and opportunities to network with professionals. Additionally, most Engineering and Technology internships are paid an average of $16 an hour!   #### Internships, Co-ops and Externships Explained   #### What is an Internship?  An Internship is a supervised pre-professional learning experience that allows students to apply their skills and knowldege in a professional setting.  These experiences are designed to enhance the student's preparedness for an intended career with a business, industry, or government agency. Internships can be either full-time or part-time lasting the duration of one semester. They are also available every fall, spring, and summer semesters.  Students may complete multiple internships with the same company or change employers at the completion of the semester. Because internships are a learning experience specific to your field of study, you may be eligible to utilize them for credit towards your degree program.   #### What is a Co-op?  Co-op is short for cooperative education which is a formal plan of education in which students alternate approximately three semeseters of full-time work with full-time study.  The \"traditional\" co-op begins at the completion of the freshman year and last for five work sessions, but many co-ops start later in the student's academic career and lasts for three sessions. The student's duties will progress over the course of each session until they are performing the tasks that they would be expected to do upon graduation. Co-ops like internships are learning experiences that may be used for credit toward your degree program.   #### What is an Externship?  An Externship is a single-day job shadowing experience. Job shadowing is an activity in which students arrange to spend a few hours or days observing professionals working in their fields of interest.  Students may see firsthand many of the rewards and challenges of a particular career as well as some of the job characteristics that no one ever thinks to tell you. Externships are not eligible for academic credit.     #### Reasons to do an Internship   #### Where can I find an Internship?  The job search process can be a daunting task.  The key to success is being proactive and treating the search like a job in and of itself.  Take initiative, stay active, and utilize the Office of Career Services to aid you in the process.  Visit the Job Search Process section to find out more.  Job Search Process   #### Can International Students do Internships?  Yes, International Students could benefit greatly from doing an internship!  International students are eligible to do up to a year of internships/co-op experience utilizing Curricular Practical Training. Information on CPT and how to apply is available through the Office of International Affairs website.

The disposal procedures used will depend upon the type and intended disposition of the media. Electronic media may be scheduled for reuse, repair, replacement, or removal from service for a variety of reasons. Proper disposal of electronic media will reduce the risk to both the university and the School of Engineering and Technology (E&T).   ### SCOPE:  The scope of this policy includes all electronic media within E&T that has been designated for disposal, transfer, or other disposition outside of the control of E&T.  All employees and faculty of E&T; as well as vendors, contractors, partners, students, collaborators and any others doing business or research with E&T will be subject to the provisions of this policy.  Any other parties, who use, work on, or provide services involving E&T computers and technology systems will also be subject to the provisions of this policy.  Data transferred as a part of normal business operations is not covered by this policy.  This policy will not supersede any Indiana University developed policies.   ### DEFINITIONS:  Electronic Media is defined as any device that is used to store or record electronic information, including, but not limited to hard disks, magnetic tapes, USB memory sticks, DVDs/CDs, videotapes, audiotapes, handheld electronic devices and removable storage devices such as floppy disks and zip disks.  Sanitizing is defined as the removal of information from electronic media or equipment such that data recovery using standard techniques or analysis is prevented.  Overwriting is one method of sanitation and is used to replace previously stored data on the electronic media with a pattern of meaningless random or non-random information.  Originating User is defined as the department, center, or office with effective ownership or control of the data on the computer hard drive or other storage media.  Department of Defense (DOD) Standard 5220.22-M, DOD Industrial Security Program, defines several methods for sanitizing various electronic media including, but not limited to, overwriting a specific number of patterns of meaningless data over the entire contents of the media or physically destroying the media.  Transfer of electronic media is allowed by this policy as long as the transfer does not violate any federal, state or university laws, rules or regulations.  All electronic media disposed of or transferred outside of the control of E&T will be either physically destroyed or the media will be sanitized in accordance with Department of Defense standards.  Reusable electronic media transferred inside the control of E&T may be sanitized at the discretion of the Originating User. If overwriting is deemed appropriate the media must be sanitized in accordance with Department of Defense standards.  The Computer Network Center is available to consult and is prepared to handle the disposition of electronic media.   ### VIOLATION OF POLICY:  If it is suspected that electronic media has not been handled in accordance with this policy, or electronic media is identified that has not been handled in accordance with this policy; notify the E&T Computer Network Center Director.

The next information session will be held online on September 15, 2022 at noon via zoom. Additional details are available at the link below  Information session for 2022-23 NEIL scholar program  Apply to the 2022 NEIL Scholar Program  [Apply to the 2022 NEIL Scholar Program](https://iu.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_ewTSzqciPvAUWk6)  NEIL scholars must be US citizens or permanent residents enrolled in an eligible engineering or computing BS degree major of the Purdue School of Engineering and Technology. While NEIL scholars will learn about Navy civilian STEM careers, there is no obligation to work for the Navy or to serve in the military.   ## BS Majors eligible for the NEIL Program   ### Program Overview  Through the program, students will:  [NSWC Crane](https://www.navsea.navy.mil/Home/Warfare-Centers/NSWC-Crane/)   ### Program Details   ## Compensation   ## Peer Leadership & Mentoring  Peer leaders serve as role models and mentors for students who follow them in learning difficult topics and skills, or into a new learning environment. For example, IUPUI hires high-achieving undergraduates as peer leaders to work in collaboration with STEM course instructors to teach student teams through active and collaborative peer-led team learning (PLTL). Instead of traditional recitation in STEM classes, peer leaders mediate weekly problem-solving sessions and facilitate team discussion of concepts and strategies. Peer leaders could also help create a learning community beyond the classroom, for example, to encourage under-represented students to persist and graduate successfully. Peer leaders are enthusiastic and motivated and have the desire to contribute to the learning of their peers. They are catalysts in forming a community of students that can serve as a support group for each other. With time, peer leaders become increasingly independent at performing these tasks and in taking on other leadership roles.  Each NEIL scholar will be placed in peer leadership roles for one semester each year in the NEIL program, and will also enroll in a series of three 1-credit courses in tandem with their leadership and mentoring assignment. The peer leadership work will require 4-8 hours/week during the semester, with a pay rate from $12/hour up to $15/hr for experienced 'superleaders'.   ## Research Assistantships & Internships  Projects will offer undergraduate students the opportunity to engage in a substantive research experience focused on a significant research problem. This is a unique opportunity provided to IUPUI faculty and researchers for mentoring students while conducting pilot projects or testing new techniques and designs. Selected NEIL scholars will be paid $15.00 an hour to work 200 hours during the project (6-8 months of the academic year or 10 weeks in the summer), and meet regularly with the faculty mentor to discuss progress on the project. NEIL scholars must participate in the writing, reflection, and poster presentation activities common to programs of the IUPUI Center for Research & Learning (CRL).  Projects are in certain Navy priority areas, broadly defined:  Typical research projects in these priority areas could be on many topics, such as:   ## Eligibility  To be selected as a NEIL Scholar, each student must be     ### Questions "

    "body": "  ### A Tight-Knit Community  Even though the IUPUI BME program is housed on a large, urban campus, the BME department is known for having a close, connected community. Having a class size of 30-40 students with BME-specific courses allows students in each class to learn more about each other and what makes each student passionate about their studies and life goals.  Frequent teamwork and collaboration also allow for biomedical engineers to walk away from IUPUI with excellent communication skills and proficiencies.   ### Connections with Local Hospitals and the IU School of Medicine  Our department has strong connections with the IU School of Medicine. IUPUI's urban campus is a short walk down the street from 4 hospitals in Indianapolis: Sidney & Lois Eskenazi Hospital, Riley Hospital for Children, IU Health University Hospital, VA Hospital Indianapolis. The IU Health Methodist Hospital can be reached via shuttle, since it's only 1.6 miles away.  Our senior capstone teams frequently partner with or shadow physicians from these facilities.  Undergraduate students have research opportunities across a variety of clinical and non-clinical departments.       ### BME Plan of Study  The IUPUI BME curriculum allows for students to specialize in one of three areas during their junior and senior years: Biomaterials, Biomechanics, or Bioinstrumentation. In order to complete your depth area, you must choose 4 courses that are within that depth.  The BME program requires 45 credits in the BME department, where almost all of the research faculty teach an undergraduate course. Four lab courses are taught alongside BME lecture content for students to proactively use lecture topics in a laboratory setting. In these lab courses, students have the opportunity to develop solutions to design projects. These design projects are meant for students to learn about collaboration, the design process, time management, and necessary skills for senior capstone projects. Along with design projects, students participate in ethics throughout their BME studies.  The IUPUI BME senior capstone project is a two-semester project: the first semester focuses on meeting with the client, understanding user needs, and diving into background knowledge. The second semester focuses on optimizing the prototype, verfication/validation testing, and data presentation.     ### Resources for a Challenging Curriculum  While the BME program is challenging, our department provides endless resources for students to master content.  Peer-Led Team-Learning  Our department has our own Peer-Led Team-Learning (PLTL) experience for the 200-level courses to provide students with additional review and practice. The PLTL model emphasizes how undergraduate students who have already taken the course can help new students practice difficult course topics. The PLTL experience can also be seen in non-BME courses, such as biology and chemistry. More about PLTL can be seen here .  [here](https://et.iupui.edu/students/pltl/)  Dedicated Staff & Faculty  Our staff and faculty at IUPUI are driven to make sure each student is successful. Course feedback is taken into account to make sure each course is the best it can be. Staff and faculty members also strive to be available for students as much as possible by holding in-person office hours (per COVID regulations) and being responsive via email. Instructors for each course are more than happy to provide students with additional information, explanation of concepts, and other resources to make sure students have the opportunity to be successful.  Student Organizations  There are several student organizations that help students connect and collaborate. Listed below are some organizations that BME students are frequently involved in:  Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES)  [Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES)](https://thespot.iupui.edu/organization/bmesatiupui)  Tau Beta Pi  [Tau Beta Pi](https://thespot.iupui.edu/organization/tbp)  Society of Women Engineers  [Society of Women Engineers](https://thespot.iupui.edu/organization/swe)  VIDA Health Partnerships  [VIDA Health Partnerships](https://thespot.iupui.edu/organization/vidahp)  Graduating with Life-Long Connections  Due to the nature of the BME program and curriculum, many students graduate from IUPUI with connections to students and faculty that will last a lifetime. Oftentimes alumni will come talk to students about their experience at IUPUI, how to be a successful student, job opportunities, and what it's like to be a full-fledged biomedical engineer. Graduates from our department are always welcome to connect with us and be involved in our growing community.   ### 5-Year BS/MS   ### Apply to IUPUI  [Undergraduate Admissions](https://admissions.iupui.edu/apply/index.html)   ### BS in BME "

    "body": "  ## Energy Engineering   ### What is Energy Engineering?  Energy is crucial to our everyday life. The demand for expert in the area will increase as the natural resource of energy is depleting. Energy Engineering (EEN) is the discipline that will deal with the challenge, which can shape the life of our future generation.  EEN advances knowledge in conventional and renewable energy, energy resources, energy analysis, efficiency improvement and energy storage system technology.  EEN students are finding exciting new ways to extract and use energy efficiently and sustainably. EEN includes the design of solar and wind power plants, fuel-cell and hybrid cars, safer nuclear power plants and more energy-efficient homes and industrial processes.  We have a finite supply of energy resources. Our response: find ways to use these resources more efficiently and develop new sources for energy.  Energy engineers discover valuable renewable energy sources that free us from dependency on quickly-depleting materials. They reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are hazardous to humans and the environment. And they eliminate waste by making our world more energy-efficient.  This broad field of engineering deals with energy efficiency, energy services, facility management, environmental compliance and alternative energy technologies. Energy engineers creatively apply their knowledge of science (physics and chemistry), engineering (electrical and mechanical) and economics to confront the global challenges of energy supply and demand.

The lab focuses on bone mechanics (ability to effectively bear loads) and mechanobiology (how cells respond to mechanical stimuli to increase mass). We investigate bone from a materials science perspective by tying morphology and composition to mechanical function and fracture resistance at length scales throughout bone's hierarchy. Our long-term goal is to use combinatorial treatments for relevant diseases that have musculoskeletal complications which lead to bone fragility. Our current interventions focus on mechanical and pharmaceutical manipulations of tissue quality and quantity.

We work in areas of mechano-transduction, endothelial mechano-biology, nuclear lamins and vascular aging. The nuclear lamina is thought to play a role in vascular pathology and aging, for example disease models such as Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome share similarities with normal vascular aging. Endothelial cells are constantly exposed hemodynamic stresses, and we are investigating how mechanical stresses impact cell functions at the nucleus level. The tools we are using include cellular and molecular techniques, quantitative and dynamic image analysis, as well as computational modeling to understand optimization of cells.   ### Poster  Explore the lab's research poster   ### Laboratory for Cellular Mechanotransduction and Reprogrammming  Sungsoo Na, PhD  The primary objective of our research group is to understand the molecular mechanism by which cells sense and respond to extracellular stimuli and to treat diseases by reprogramming cell’s intracellular signaling and extracellular cues. Our lab uses advanced research tools and techniques, including real-time imaging and manipulation of intracellular signaling proteins; cytoskeletal structure deformation and stress distribution in live cells; and various chemical and mechanical biotechnologies and their applications to cells and tissues. Current research interests include tumor cell mechanics and biology, manipulation of signaling pathways in tumor-bone interactions, and interaction of metabolic and mechanotransduction signaling pathways in cancer.   ### Poster  Explore the lab's research poster  [Video Watch a video over the lab's research](https://youtu.be/7D-qOcoS5zE)   ### Video  Watch a video over the lab's research   ### Skeletal and Cancer Research Lab  Hiroki Yokota, PhD  Research area: bone/cancer biology, biomechanics, and bioinformatics.

They don't have to though.  With the right tools and a little preparation you can learn to master the art of interviewing.  Start by watching this four (4) minute video on the subject.         #### Before Your Interview  Before you head into that pressure-filled interview, be sure to spend some time with our Career Services staff to make sure you are making your best first impression. Come see us for a mock interview where we will ask you questions like \"if you could buy any skill you don't currently possess, what would it be\". Questions like this are tricky and we can teach you how to navigate them with confidence.  [Research The Company What are their products, locations and competitors?

Click one to be taken to our scheduling app.   #### Only arrive 5-10 minutes early.  Why?  If you arrive earlier, you'll interrupt the person who has to greet you.   #### Watch Your Non-Verbals  Handshakes, fidgeting and eye contact all send messages to your interviewer.   #### Expect to do the majority of the talking.  A typical interviewer will only talk 30% of the time.   #### Don't ramble.  Use the STAR approach when answering questions which stands for Situation, Task Action, Response.   #### Be genuine and tell the truth.  Interviewers are trained to look for someone exaggerating stories or telling lies.   #### Have questions prepared.  But! Do not ask about benefits or salary unless the interviewer brings them up.   #### Send a thank you email.  Send one to each person you met including your interviewers and HR within 48 hours.  Vary them as they may share with each other.   #### Follow Up.  If you have not heard back by when they told you, simply email reiterating your interest and ask if you are still being considered.  Do not send more than one email every 2-3 weeks.  [Dress a notch above the dress code. Suits are always acceptable. Any combination of a dress shirt, slacks,  blazers, skirts, and ties are acceptable as well. Visit Paw's Closet for discount attire.](https://studentaffairs.iupui.edu/advocacy-resources/food-and-clothing-services/closet/index.html)   #### Dress a notch above the dress code.  Suits are always acceptable. Any combination of a dress shirt, slacks,  blazers, skirts, and ties are acceptable as well. Visit Paw's Closet for discount attire.   #### Be neutral with your smells.  Shower, comb hair, shave (or have neat facial hair), no food in teeth, no bad breath. Don't wear too much cologne or perfume (they may be allergic).   #### Interviewing Best Practices  No two interviews are alike so preparing for them can be a challenge. However, there are some common themes that exist in every interview. Check out the below list of our best practices.   #### Step One: Research the Company   ##### Research what and who the company is including products, services, locations, competitors. They will expect you to know this information. Also, brush up on your knowledge of industry trends. What are the challenges and opportunities that may impact the business? What is their business strategy?   #### Step Two: Research the Job   ##### Be sure to research the job to learn as much as you can about it before the interview day.   #### Step Three: Research Yourself   ##### Researching yourself means to review your resume and experience to remind yourself of the skills you possess that makes you the best candidate for the job. This step will help eaves nerves and anxiety about the interview and position.   #### Step Four: Suit Yourself  How you dress for an interview is your first impression during the process.  It's a visual assessment to see if you are taking the interview process seriously and if you'll fit in with the company culture.  Unless specifically told otherwise, you'll want to dress in business attire.  Hair, teeth, facial hair, and nails should all be well groomed.  A conservative suit - a jacket with a shirt and tie paired with pants or a skirt in basic colors such as black, navy or grey.  Finish the look with dress shoes, basic pumps or flats.  Make sure they are closed toe and comfortable - you never know how much you might have to walk.  Keep accessories like belts, watches and jewelry simple. Nothing tight or short.  Maintain a classic look.       #### Types of Interviews  There are several types of interviews a recruiter might use to determine if you would be a good candidate for their positions. Here are a few versions:   ## Screening Interview   ## Panel Interview   ## Case Interview  Involves a short presentation of a business problem followed by a discussion where you will be asked how you would approach the problem and solution.   ## Virtual Interview   ## Technical Interview   ## Stress Interview   #### Type of Interview Questions  Have we mentioned how important it is to prepare and anticipate questions?  It's important to prepare for types of questions and know that you can't prepare for every question they may ask.  Practice in the mirror, with friends and with Career Services.   #### Openers  T h e s e a r e d e s i g n e d t o s t a r t t h e c o n v e r s a t i o n a n d a r e u s u a l l y o p e n - e n d e d.   #### Behavioral  Most of the questions you will be asked are Behavioral Based Interview Questions. These are designed to ask you examples from your past experiences that will in theory determine how you will behave in the future.  They are generally open-ended and begin with \"Tell me about a time when...\" or \"Describe a time when...\"  The key to answering these questions is to give a specific example that uses the STAR method to tell the story.   #### Expectations  These are designed to make sure your expectations are realistic and are able to be matched by the company.   #### Hypothetical Situations  These are designed to see if you can think creatively and to see how you would handle real-life situations.   #### Technical  These are designed to assess your technical knowledge and your ability to communicate your thought process.   #### Job Knowledge  T h e s e a r e d e s i g n e d t o a s s e s s y o u r k n o w l e d g e o f t h e i n d u s t r y a n d t h e p o s i t i o n .   #### Values  T h e s e a r e d e s i g n e d t o b e t t e r u n d e r s t a n d y o u r s e l f - a w a r e n e s s a n d w h a t i s i m p o r t a n t t o y o u .   #### Make You Squirm  T h e s e a r e d e s i g n e d t o m a k e y o u s q u i r m a n d t o s e e h o w c r e a t i v e y o u a r e .   #### University Related  T h e s e a r e d e s i g n e d t o b e t t e r u n d e r s t a n d h o w y o ur e d u c a t i o n h a s p r e p a r e d y o u .   #### Closing  T h e s e a r e d e s i g n e d t o e n d t h e i n t e r v i e w a n d g a t h e r a n y c l o s i n g d e t a i l s .   #### Questions To Ask The Interviewer  These are designed to find out if you have prepared for the interview which includes questions to ask.   #### Do Not Ask!

    "body": "  #### BSEEN/MSME Curriculum  The BSEEN/MSME (BS/MS) requires:  BSEEN Plan of Study    The curriculum includes all the core undergraduate courses that are currently required for BSEEN majors and all the current graduate course requirements of the traditional ME Master's program.  Students are required to maintain a minimum GPA of 3.2 for the first 85 credit hours of course work (normally the end of fifth semester) in the plan of study to be conditionally admitted to the program. Energy Engineering Undergraduates who have completed more than 85 credits hours are also eligible to apply to this program, provided that their most current GPA is over 3.2, and they will be willing to take four graduate courses as ME electives for the BS degree part of their plan of study. Interested students are advised to contact the department office at SL 260 for details.  The total credit hours required for this dual BSMS degree program are 158 hours. For reference, the traditional BSEEN requires 128 hours, and the MS in ME requires 30 hours, for a total of 158 hours. The integrated program is constructed to exploit an overlap of 12 credit hours of approved Graduate Level courses, thereby reducing the number of credit hours needed to an additional 18 credit hours of Graduate Level Courses.  Students are admitted to the MEE department, under the guidelines that currently exist for admitting traditional BS students. The sequence of courses that they will take for the first three years will be identical to the courses taken by the traditional EEN majors. The students are made aware of the option to pursue the dual degree program during their first year, and counseled appropriately if they wish to pursue it.  There are two plans of study for students to maintain in this program: 1) BS plan of study that is to be filed no later than one semester before completing the BS degree requirements (normally in the seventh semester), including the 12 credit hours of graduate courses to be taken in place of the EEN Electives, and 2) MS plan of study that is to be completed after the completion of the BS plan of study (normally in the ninth semester), which will include the four graduate courses (12 credit hours) taken.  The two plans of study to be maintained are attached to this document, where the four overlapped graduate courses (12 credit hours) are to be indicated in both BS and MS plans.  The final admission to the graduate program are not be made unless the student meets the minimum 3.00 GPA requirement and receives at least a B grade in each of the four graduate courses in his/her BS plan of study.  A minimum GPA of 3.00 will be required in the MS plan of study for graduation as in the traditional Master's program. Master's GPA will be calculated by including the grades of four graduate courses transferred from the BS plan of study.  The program is designed such that a student in the program is able to switch to the traditional BSEEN at any time to receive only a BSEEN degree.  The graduate program offers THESIS and NON-THESIS options. Depending on the nature of the research, in some cases the THESIS option may require an additional semester to finish. Thesis committees are to consist of at least three members from MEE department.  The Graduate Committee reviews each student's performance each semester after they are conditionally admitted to the dual degree program.  Following the conditional admission, the student's performance are assessed by the ME Graduate Committee at the end of each semester to ensure that the student's performance is at the level expected for traditional MS students in the ME graduate program and the grades in each Master's courses in the BSEEN plan of study must be B or higher.  As mentioned previously, if a student decides to leave the program, he/she will still be eligible to receive a BSEEN degree. Also, if the student's performance is judged to be unsatisfactory for the dual degree program by the ME Graduate Committee, because of not meeting the minimum grade requirements (minimum of 3.00 GPA in BS plan of study and minimum B grade in each of the first four graduate courses taken), the student is still able to receive a BS in ME upon completion of all the requirements for that degree.

The Mechanical engineer has many job choices and has the opportunity to work in well established technological fields or at the cutting edge of science. Whether at the molecular scale or at the scale of large, complex systems, Mechanical engineering principles are used in the conception, design, development, and manufacture of almost every product made by man.  The following provides additional information about the Undergraduate Program and the Graduate Program at IUPUI as well as more about IUPUI in general .  [IUPUI in general](http://www.iupui.edu/about/)  To enroll in the Mechanical Engineering and Energy Department you need to be admitted to IUPUI. The admission process can be started by visiting this page: IUPUI Admissions .  [IUPUI Admissions](http://enroll.iupui.edu/admissions/)   ### Welcome to Mechanical and Energy Engineering at IUPUI  As a graduate student or an undergraduate student there are numerous ways to get involved in research in Mechanical Engineering. At the graduate level you can become a Research Assistant and be involved in full-time research, or you can take directed research courses if full-time research is not your interest. As an undergraduate, there are a number of opportunities to get involved in research. From a similar directed research program, to the Multidisciplinary Undergraduate Research Institute (MURI) which coordinates small research teams of undergraduate students with faculty advisors. The faculty in the Mechanical Engineering program at IUPUI not only have a strong commitment to education but also have world class research programs in the following areas.  More information about the research being performed in the Mechanical Engineering and Energy Department at IUPUI can be found at the ME Research Laboratories page.  The Department continues to expand with the hiring of new faculty in areas as diverse as nano-scale modeling to fuel cell technology. New courses keep the ME graduate and undergraduate curricula current and relevant. We have recently added new courses in renewable energy and system engineering to the curriculum.

There are numerous student chapters of professional and honor societies such as the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Society of Automotive Engineering, Pi Tau Sigma, and the Society of Women Engineers which provide leadership opportunities, collegial activities, and learning experiences outside the classroom.  Our mission is to provide you with the best educational and research curriculum possible, giving you the tools and knowledge you need to succeed in whatever field of Mechanical Engineering you choose.   ### What is Mechanical Engineering?  Mechanical engineering (ME) is one of the most versatile and multidisciplinary engineering disciplines. ME encompasses almost all aspects of modern technology from man-made devices to biological systems. Mechanical engineers design, develop, and manufacture every kind of vehicle, power system, machine, and tool. Any type of machine that produces, transmits, or uses power is most likely the product of a mechanical engineer. Mechanical Engineers are also expected to understand and be able to apply concepts from the chemistry, math, physics, and electrical engineering fields.   ### Careers in Mechanical Engineering  Mechanical engineering graduates qualify for jobs in areas such as computer-aided engineering (finite element method, virtual prototyping, computer-aided manufacturing), fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, heat transfer, manufacturing, robotics, control systems, stress analysis, applied thermodynamics, combustion, heating, refrigeration and air conditioning, and turbomachinery. Moreover, emerging technologies in biotechnology, materials science, and nanotechnology are likely to create new job opportunities for mechanical engineers. ME graduates work in one of several departments of businesses including design, manufacturing, research, testing, and management. They work in diverse insdustries such as aerospace, automotive, electronics, energy, HVAC, manufacturing, materials processing, medical device, nuclear, and pharmaceutical industries as lead personnel.

    "body": "  #### Acoustics and Health  Acoustics affects health in multiple ways. Current projects in this lab include an investigation of vocal acoustics and vocal damage and algorithmic vocal diction detection. Technical tools and methods such as audio signal processing, computational fluid dynamics, and machine learning methods are employed for this area.  Additionally, ongoing research into the acoustics of healthcare facilities extends Dr. Hsu's Ph.D. dissertation. Room acoustics, background noise, and architectural design affects human health and work conditions in the built environment. Creating acoustic products and researching ways the acoustics affects musicians and others is a focus on this lab's work.   #### Sustainability in Architectural Acoustics  Recent projects focus on the design of diffusers arrays and the materials they are made from. Shape grammar, a design method used in various contexts, plays a critical role in reimagining how diffusers designs can be generated and deployed, resulting in both surprising and unique acoustical properties and visual complexity. Additionally, using unique materials as a way to create more eco-friendly designs with low ecological hazard will allow these panels to be deployed in a green, acoustically efficient, and visually compelling manner.  Collaborating with Jonathan Dessi-Olive at Kansas State University, this ongoing research project seeks to create lower cost acoustical arrays that link acoustical and design parameters. For more information, view the project page.  Additionally, the lab has continued to research historical acoustics, looking at the preserving culturally important venues in extant and non-extant venues. While previous work simulated opera houses of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart where simulations can place a listener to virtually experience what Mozart may have heard, ongoing work extends this project into non-Western spaces in preserving the culture and heritage of traditionally underrepresented populations.   #### Musical Acoustics  Musicians have been impacted by acoustics from the beginnings of music. The research of this lab continues to investigate the link between acoustics, musicians, composers, and instruments. Multidisciplinary research that connects mechanical design methods with musical composition and performance leads to a unique design methodology that attempts to create opportunities for the music to drive the creativity and the engineering and acoustic design.  Some of the student built innovative instruments created have resulted in two exhibitions at the Stubbins Gallery in Atlanta, GA, as well as the Ferst Center for the Arts, as part of the events of the Margaret Guthman New Musical Instrument Competition.   #### Current Students  Bhawna Rathi, Ph.D. Student  Saad Ansari, M.S.

The need for improvement in undergraduate STEM writing skills, especially in engineering fields, is widely recognized [1]. However, several factors make addressing it difficult—the increased demand to teach more specialized content in fewer credit hours, faculty lack of expertise to address students’ writing, and the significant underestimation by students of the amount of writing that will be required in their future positions.  WATTS is a targeted training session for peer writing tutors that is collaboratively taught by a STEM instructor and tutor supervisor. It is being evaluated for its impact on all involved stakeholders: students, tutors, instructors, and tutor supervisors.  This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Nos. 2013467, 2013496, 2013541.

We recognize the important roles music technology and clinical musical skills play in the clinical practice of music therapy, we believe that technology allows music therapists to connect with and empower clients in ways that seemed impossible only a few years ago, and we expect the relationship with technology to grow in the future. In fact, we expect that graduates of the IUPUI Bachelor of Science in Music Therapy (BSMTh) will be prepared to develop and work in clinical areas that do not currently exist because of their grounding in the relationship between music technology and clinical music therapy practice.  The BSMTh is an approved program of the American Music Therapy Association that provides students with the musical, technical, and therapeutic skills to practice as entry-level music therapists in a variety of clinical fields. Students engage in traditional academic music studies (music theory, aural skills, and music history), piano, voice, guitar, percussion, improvisation, music technology, psychology, and music therapy specific courses.  The degree culminates in a six-month clinical internship after the completion of approximately eight semesters of course work and on-campus clinical training. Students who successfully complete the BSMTh curriculum, including internship, are eligible to take the Music Therapy Board Certification Exam and earn the credential, Music Therapist-Board Certified (MT-BC).  [Music Therapy Board Certification Exam](https://www.cbmt.org/candidates/examination/)     ### Curriculum  The Bachelor of Science in Music Therapy (BSMTh) curriculum is based on the American Music Therapy Association Professional Competencies. The courses cover musical foundations, clinical foundations, music therapy foundations, and general education. The general education courses in the BSMTh curriculum were specifically selected to meet some of the professional competencies; therefore, students should plan to take those courses rather than substituting other classes. Many of our classes include service learning or experiential learning components.   #### Plan of Study  The BSMTh degree requires 120 credit hours of coursework.

If approved to do so via this application process, prospective students will also be required to take an audition/interview and two short online placement exams (see Audition Information below).  [IUPUI university online application](https://admissions.iupui.edu/apply/index.html)  [Music and Arts Technology online application](https://app.getacceptd.com/iupui)   ### Admission Requirements  [Apply Here](https://admissions.iupui.edu/apply/index.html)  [Apply Here](https://app.getacceptd.com/iupui)   #### 2023-2024 Music Therapy Audition dates (applications will be available starting Sept. 1)   ### General Audition Information  Auditions will held in person unless a remote video audition request has been approved.  If you need to request a remote video audition please contact Ms. Julie Wynn, Academic Advisor, Department of Music and Arts Technology julwynn@iupui.edu .  IUPUI policy requires all individuals to wear a mask inside buildings on campus.  The required audition session allows applicants to demonstrate interests, skills, and experiences in 1) music performance and creativity, 2) contemporary music technologies, 3) other arts-related creative, technological, and/or engineering fields, and 4) comprehension of music theory. Applicants are not required to demonstrate in all of these areas, though the audition committee is seeking applicants likely to excel in a degree balancing music technology course-work with music theory and performance/creative skills.  If a student has college credit, a minimum 2.0 GPA is required to apply and audition. A “primary instrument” declared for degree entry is to be used in the audition for a performance/creativity skill demonstration (i.e. a specific instrumental/voice, or “applied music technology” such as laptop/software, midi controllers, etc.). This choice determines a student’s path for individual studio instruction throughout the degree. Regardless of primary instrument, applicants are encouraged to bring computer-based demonstrations to illuminate skills and experiences in areas noted above.**See below for detailed primary instrument/technologies information** Audition requests will be processed only after submitting your application. If an audition is approved and scheduled, you will receive information on how to take two short online placement exams related to the degree program. These online exams must be completed prior to the audition date. Note that 1) your acceptance into IUPUI as a student and 2) the departmental application must both be completed at least three weeks prior to the date of the requested audition.   ### Remote Auditions  If you live within a reasonable distance of Indianapolis, it is expected your audition will be in-person. If excessive travel distance to Indianapolis prohibits an in-person audition, or you require an accommodation due to a documented disability, you may contact the department to request a remote video audition. A remote audition is normally conducted on one of the specified departmental audition session dates. For more info or questions, please contact Ms. Julie Wynn, Academic Advisor, Department of Music and Arts Technology  317-278-3264 julwynn@iupui.edu   ### What to Expect at the Audition  Auditions are planned for 15 minutes. Specific scheduling that day will be determined by our department audition administrator. An applicant should be prepared to address, though demonstrations and/or verbal responses:  Equipment Provided at the Auditions:  Please Note:   ### Specific Audition Requirements by Primary Instrument  Students are encouraged to choose repertoire that best represents their experience, skill level, and artistic range.    Instrumentalist (general)  [http://www.issma.net/semanuals.php](http://www.issma.net/semanuals.php)  Note for percussionists: We can have a drum set and/or a marimba/vibraphone available for you to perform on for the audition. Percussionists are asked to specify if they will need a drum set and/or mallet percussion provided for the audition in the program application.    Note for guitarists: Examples from any of the following collections (or equivalent) would be appropriate audition material:  If you have any further guitar-related questions please contact: John Alvarado, Senior Lecturer of Guitar joalvara@iupui.edu .    Vocalist    Applied Music Technologies as Primary Instrument  ACCEPTANCE INTO THE MUSIC THERAPY PROFESSIONAL PROGRAM    While one may state that she or he is a Pre-Music Therapy major and be listed as such in the registrar’s office, a student must apply to move ahead in the professional program. The professional program is defined as starting with Practicum I. Admission to the professional program requires instructor permission. To get permission, the prospective student must apply to the professional program. The application normally takes place at the end of the sophomore year. Prior to application, students must:      Once admitted to the professional program, Music Therapy majors:      Students seeking admission to the Music Therapy professional program must pass a criminal background check before admission is granted. Admission will be automatically denied to any student who fails to either complete the background check or who fails said check. Payment for the background check is the responsibility of the student (approximately $65/year).    Students who pass their initial background check but who later engage in criminal behaviors, which may result in the failure of a subsequent yearly background check, must notify the Music Therapy faculty of the incident so appropriate advising can take place. Engaging in any kind of criminal behavior may jeopardize the student’s ability to advance in the MT professional program, secure an internship, earn appropriate licensure, and/or gain employment as a music therapist. Faculty members are not liable for inaccurate or inappropriate advising arising from the failure of a student to report potential changes in his/her ability to pass a criminal background check. "

This is a chance for you to gain understanding of what it's really like to be in the industry, and if you do it right, it could lead to future employment.   #### Networking - It's not what you know, it's who you know!  Networking is easy.  Connect with as many people as you can on LinkedIn, right?  Wrong!  True networking is the foundation for relationship building.  In order for that foundation to build, there has to be a genuine connection between you and the person you are networking with.  Who is in my network?  Your professional network is larger than you realize. Your network consists of personal, professional, online and organizational connections.  It can also consist of incidental connections like when you're waiting in line or on a plane or even the waiting room at the doctor's office.    Networking Receptions  These events are usually hosted by an organization and are an opportunity for you to meet people from a particular industry or social group.  The primary goal of attending these events is to meet new people.  What to Say  Introduce yourself, ask what brought them to the event.  Ask questions about them such as what you do for a living, where are you from, how long have you been a member of this group.  The goal is to see who you have things in common with, connect with them and maintain that relationship so that when you need to ask them for a referral or informational interview it doesn't seem so random.  What to do with your contacts?   #### Long Distance Job Search  Job searching is hard, especially when you are looking for a job in another state or country.  Although the same concept, you have to alter your game plan when you're trying to land a job from afar.  Buzzfile  Have no idea what companies are located in the area? Have no fear!  Buzzfile to the rescue!  Use the site to research companies by state and then by area of interest or your major.  It will give you basic company information including a description, the industry and annual revenue.  To get started, go to buzzfile.com, click on buzzfile.edu and then click on \"employers by major.\"  Local Universities  Find a local university and use their career services to help you find companies that are hiring.  Access their career fair information for a list of companies attending.  This will get you an idea of who is actually hiring.  Some schools also let students from other universities attend their career fairs - just check with them first!  NaceLink Jobs  With over 600 participating schools, and 5 million employers, NaceLink is one of the largest recruiting networks for college career centers.  LinkedIn  LinkedIn can be used in a variety of ways to help with your search. "

The first subject area broadly introduces the topic of probability theory (e.g. relative-frequency, set theory, and axioms of probability, conditional probability, independence, and Bernoulli trials) as related to sampled data. This leads to the introduction of random variables and distribution functions (e.g. probability density functions, mean values and moments, Gaussian random variables, density functions conditional density functions, joint distributions, covariance, sums of random variables) along with sampling and estimation theory (e.g. point and interval estimation, sampling distributions, estimation of means and variances, hypothesis testing, regression analysis and goodness-of-fit tests). The second subject area focuses upon random process definitions and measurement of random processes from biological signal sources (e.g. correlation, cross-correlation and applications to analysis of random processes from multiple biological sources). The third subject area utilizes recent articles from the scientific literature demonstrating the application of these and other mathematical processing techniques ( e.g. spectral density, properties of spectral density, and mean-square values from spectral density) in the study of biological signals and physiological systems. Refer to the lecture schedule for specific topics and dates. "

    "body": "  #### Hiring International Students  Recruiting International Students  Many employers express concerns about hiring international students in the United States. They are unaware of the simplicity and benefits of hiring international students who are studying in the U.S. on a student or exchange visitor visa. These international students can work in their field of study during academic sessions, vacation periods, and after completion of study without the need to change their immigration status. Highly qualified foreign students bring to any organization new paradigms of thinking, strong work ethics, culture and ethnic diversity, adaptability, multiple languages, and a broad range of communications skills.  Advantage of Hiring International Students Hiring international students gives employers a competitive edge along with other advantages:  Employers do NOT have to:  Before Graduation  Curricular Practical Training (CPT) is defined by the United States Citizen and Immigration Services as employment that is an “integral part” of a student’s course of study. This work experience may be required by the student’s degree program or may be an elective if it is an important part of the program of study. According to the immigration regulations, this employment may be an internship, cooperative education job, a practicum, or any other work experience that is either required for the student's degree (as defined in the course catalog) or for which academic credit is awarded. The student applies through IUPUI Office of International Affairs without the need for assistance from the employer.  After Graduation  Most students who complete or are near completion of their degrees in the United States are eligible to accept short-term employment in the United States. It is not necessary for them to change their visa status for this type of legal employment. The students simply apply to IUPUI Office of International Affairs or USCIS (United States Citizenship and Immigration Services) for their Employment Authorization Document (EAD) permits to do Optional Practical Training (OPT).  An employer needs to complete an I-9 form for any new international employee and check with the international student to be sure that he/she has a valid EAD card. The EAD card is issued by the USCIS upon receipt of a recommendation from the student's school. Employers do not have to sponsor a student for a Permanent Residency, prove that no United States citizen is available to do the job, or complete any special paperwork for any employee.  You may extend the student's employment if an employer should want to retain an IUPUI International Graduate past the allowed employment period on the EAD card; it is possible to secure an H1-B Visa which can provide up to six additional years of employment.

Mechanics of Instabilities in the Brain and Other Soft Materials Maria Holland, Ph.D. University of Notre Dame    Abstract  The brain is our most complex yet least understood organ, and many questions remain as to its development and the intricate relation between form and function.  The characteristic wrinkling of the human brain is the result of both biological and mechanical processes during development, and the field of solid mechanics offers a new and important perspective on these questions. The stability properties of layered materials have previously been studied because of applications such as composite materials and wearable electronics.  Layered biological tissues such as the brain share many similarities to these well-studied systems, but differ because both layers are extremely soft.  The focus of this talk will be on the unique features of instabilities in soft layered materials, covering theoretical, computational, physical, and imaging approaches, and their implications for the developing brain in both health and disease.  About the Speaker  Maria Holland is the Clare Boothe Luce Assistant Professor of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering at the University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, IN.  She earned her M.S. and Ph.D. from Stanford University in the Department of Mechanical Engineering with Prof. Ellen Kuhl, and her bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Tulsa, graduating Phi Beta Kappa.  Her research is in computational biomechanics, using solid mechanics and computational tools to address important questions about complex soft materials, including the brain.  Through collaborations with clinicians and experimentalists, she aims to understand the development of the human brain and how it relates to the brain’s form and function.  Additionally, she works to extend the functionality of traditional engineering methods to encompass soft, growing materials.

    "body": "  #### Introduction   #### History and Background  Many disciplines are attracted to the genius of Leonardo da Vinci, but his unique combination and mastery of mechanics and anatomy poised him to be the first Biomedical Engineer with a biomechanics specialty. The discovery of electricity and current led to a charged debate between Galvani and Volta in Italy in the late 18th century. Their debate was based on observations of frog leg stimulation and contraction, which led to how bioelectricity formed the initial understanding of these fundamental electrical theories. As the scientific basis of medicine progressed into the 20th century, devices for measuring and monitoring body functions required technical skills beyond a physician's primary clinical training. The use of X-rays to obtain images of the body was also a significant technological driving force for the overlap of engineering and medicine at this time. The Professional Group on Engineering in Medicine and Biology was formed in 1948 under the auspices of several professional societies. National and international conferences were held regularly and several organizations trace their origins to this period. Several academic Biomedical Engineering programs trace their roots to the 1950s but were housed within traditional engineering departments. Most were in electrical engineering programs since the initial medical devices were mostly electrical or focused on imaging. As the medical community took a more \"constructive\" role in treating disease and injuries, cardiac bypass surgery, kidney dialysis, and orthopedic implants increased the roles for biomechanics and biomaterials. Again, as medicine discovers the role of the genetic code and molecular biology for diagnosing and treating diseases, biomedical engineering has kept pace with development of tissue engineering, micro electrical-mechanical systems (MEMS), sophisticated drug delivery, and nanotechnologies.   #### Biomedical Engineering Today "

    "body": "  #### To grad school or not to grad school?  Before you start compiling your applications, there are some questions to ask yourself to determine if graduate or professional school is right for you at this time in your life.  Do I have a career goal in mind that requires additional education?  Graduate education is a form of specialization.  You want to embark on this process with an end goal or interest in mind.  No one is going to hold you to your \"ten year goal\" as your aspirations are expected to grow and change as you grow and change, but having a purpose and direction can impact your graduate education success.  Ideally, graduate education is not the end goal in and of itself, but rather the next step to accomplishing your career vision.  Am I applying to grad school to delay the job search process?  If you are simply continuing your education to avoid the job search process, schedule an appointment with Career Services.  Sometimes, students lean towards continuing their education because academia is familiar and the job search process can be intimidating.  The Office of Career Services can demystify the job search process.  6.9% of students from the Purdue School of Engineering and Technology at IUPUI go onto graduate school right after completing their bachelor's degree.   ## Selecting Schools  There are several factors that may contribute to your selection of graduate or professional schools.  Give some thought to the following considerations:  Competitiveness  Finances permitting, try to stratify your target schools to include a \"safety\" school, several \"possible\" programs, and at least one \"dream\" school.  You don't want to forever wonder if you could have gotten in.  You can assess your competitiveness by reviewing the average GPA and GRE scores of those admitted in various programs.  Financial Considerations  The exact number of schools you apply to may be impacted by financial considerations.  The application process can be expensive and time consuming.  Be sure to explore the application and test fees to determine what you can comfortably manage.  Geographical Preference or Restrictions  Give some thought to your geographical preferences or restrictions.  If you are geographically bound, that may dictate the programs you explore.  If not, climate, locale, culture etc. may influence where you determine is a good fit for you both in and out of the classroom.  Faculty or Research Match  By all means, faculty / research match is the primary aspect of selecting doctoral programs and to a lesser degree, masters programs.  If pursuing doctoral work, you need to identify a faculty mentor you would like to work with, familiarize yourself with her/his research, and align yourself accordingly.  Where our students go:     ## Your Applications  Managing the application process for several schools simultaneously can be cumbersome.  Develop a system early to help you stay organized and mindful of deadlines.  Below is a list of commonly required application materials:  CV or Resume  Most applications require an academic CV as part of the application process.  Check out our CV writing resources below and be sure to have your CV reviewed by both Career Services and faculty within your academic area.  Personal Statement / Statement of Purpose  This is a component of the application and serves a couple of purposes.  First, it is a writing sample that demonstrates your written communication skills.  Second, it provides the reader with your \"story.\"  You need to be able to clearly articulate your interest in the field, your experiences to date that helped shape your goals, what you will bring to a graduate program, how a graduate degree will help you accomplish your career goals, and why THIS program at THIS university is the best fit for you to be successful.  Department Specific Requirements  Many departments require supplemental essays or applications.  Be sure to address the questions that are asked and have your materials reviewed by others.  GRE Score  Many programs require GRE scores as part of the application process.  The GRE (Graduate Record Examination) is a standardized test administered by Educational Testing Services (ETS).  Most programs require the General GRE and many also require the Subject GRE.  Taking the GRE is an investment in both time and money.  Be sure to prepare for the GRE by using print and electronic resources.  ETS offers a free PowerPrep series that provides you with two sample GRE tests.  Take the first one to establish a baseline to identify your weakest areas to help you focus your time and energy.  When you take the GRE, you can input four schools to have your scores sent to automatically as part of your testing fee.  After receiving your scores, supplemental score reports can be sent to additional schools for a per-school fee.If you are simply continuing your education to avoid the job search process, schedule an appointment with Career Services.  Sometimes, students lean towards continuing their education because academia is familiar and the job search process can be intimidating.  The Office of Career Services can demystify the job search process.  Recommendation Letters  Most graduate programs will require three letters of recommendation.  This is an important component of the application process.  Be sure to select your recommenders wisely.  They need to be able to attest to your skills and abilities to be successful in pursuing graduate education and accomplishing your career goals.  Ideally, your recommenders will be faculty members who know you well and can share more about you than that you come to class and do well on exams.  Also, be mindful of the deadline and time considerations.  Give your recommenders adequate time to compose a strong recommendation letter and provide them with a deadline prior to the final application deadline to allow for time to follow up if necessary.  Keep in mind, most doctoral and professional programs (and some masters programs) require an interview as a part of the selection process.  Work with Career Services to develop and practice your interviewing skills.   ## Plan B  Even if you feel confident that graduate or professional school is in your immediate future, take time to develop a Plan B.  Your goals may shift during your last year of your undergraduate education, you may not be admitted to your school of choice, or funding may be an unexpected issue.  Give some thought to your alternative plan and keep your options open.  You may need to conduct a job search or consider other types of educational programs.  Talk with Career Services, faculty, and advisors to help identify your options.   #### What is the difference between a CV and a Resume?  If you are applying for graduate school or academic positions, you will be asked to submit a CV (curriculum vitae) rather than a resume.  While both documents must provide a persuasive account of your skills and experiences as they relate to the specific position or opportunity, there are key difference in how that goal is accomplished.  CV  A CV is a comprehensive document that presents your full history and qualifications, usually used for academic purposes.  There is no length limitation to a CV as it will include all of your research, publications, conference presentations, services, teaching, etc.  Resume  A resume is a marketing tool that markets your education, experience, and skills with the intent of landing you an interview.  Resumes are typically one to two pages in length and includes select information to market your skills and abilities.  Managers often review hundreds of applications and each resume is reviewed for a few seconds - therefore your resume needs to present your qualifications clearly and concisely.  Resume / CV Hybrid  If you are applying for a nonacademic research-oriented position or an administrative position within academia, it is possible that you will want to use a hybrid document that is a cross between a resume and a CV.  In these instances, you may create a two-page document that provides more information than the typical resume (such as research experience, recent publications etc.) but is still much shorter than a CV.  Key Differences    What to Include  Below are several sections you can include on your CV.  The order of the information can fluctuate depending on the goal of the CV and the type of position for which you are applying.

This dual degree allows medical students the opportunity for in-depth training in engineering and technology relevant to the clinic and translational research.  This program is available only to IUSM students on the Indianapolis campus. Students enrolled in IUSM will take a year away from the medical school curriculum to complete the necessary course work for the MS BME degree, thus allowing these students the benefit of earning a medical doctorate from Indiana University and a MS in BME from Purdue University right here on the same campus within 5 years.   ## How to Apply  Interested IUSM students should apply to the BME Master’s program 1 to 2 semesters before they want to start the MS program (typically in the fall). MD students should also consult with their IUSM advisors to find the best time to exit and return to their MD curriculum to minimize interruption to their medical training process. Contact the BME department for more information.

These guidelines are described in detail in the BME MS Graduate Handbook. One exception is that MCAT scores will be accepted in place of the GRE.  Students with a non-BME or non-engineering undergraduate degree who are accepted into the program may be offered introductory or co-requisite graduate level courses aimed at bridging any deficiencies in math and engineering, with a focus on their specific area of concentration.   ## Fellowship Opportunities  Teaching Assistantship: The TA provides partial financial support for expenses related to graduate tuition, program fees, student health insurance and/or living expenses. The TA requires at least 6 credits of degree-applicable coursework and up to 20 hours of service to the BME department (e.g. laboratory and/or recitation assistant, grading.) The TA is renewable each semester in response to available service opportunities in the BME department.  Dean’s Scholar : Scholarship of up to $4K per semester ($8K per academic year, excluding summer) is available to new, first-year, non-resident, full-time graduate students to apply toward tuition for courses taken in the School of Engineering and Technology.  Dual degree students electing to complete a thesis project are eligible for funding as a graduate research assistant.   #### Plan of Study  The MS BME program requires a total of 30 credit hours. Medical school students can apply 12 credits from their medical school program toward the BME MS degree as part of this dual degree program. These medical school credits will satisfy graduate life science course requirements. The remaining 18 credit hours will include graduate BME or other engineering courses as well as a mathematical or statistics courses, to be taken in two semesters – typically in fall and spring semesters to minimize time away from the MD curriculum.   #### Plan of Study with a Non-Thesis option   #### Plan of Study with a Thesis Option  While the Master’s program consists primarily of two semesters of didactic coursework, it is possible to complete a thesis-based BME Master’s degree with this dual degree program. For IUSM students interested in completing a thesis project, they should arrange in advance with a faculty sponsor, and begin working on a research project as soon as possible. Please check with the MD/MS Program Handbook for more details.   #### MD/MS in BME Handbook  Download the MD/MS in BME handbook as a PDF.  MD/MS in BME Handbook "

    "body": "  ## Navy Engineering Innovation & Leadership (NEIL)  The IUPUI Navy Engineering Innovation & Leadership (NEIL) training program will provide scholarships and training in leadership, research, teaching, and career development for selected high-achieving engineering and computing students.  The next information session will be held online on September 15, 2022 at noon via zoom. Additional details are available at the link below  Information session for 2022-23 NEIL scholar program  Apply to the 2022 NEIL Scholar Program  [Apply to the 2022 NEIL Scholar Program](https://iu.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_ewTSzqciPvAUWk6)  NEIL scholars must be US citizens or permanent residents enrolled in an eligible engineering or computing BS degree major of the Purdue School of Engineering and Technology. While NEIL scholars will learn about Navy civilian STEM careers, there is no obligation to work for the Navy or to serve in the military.   ## BS Majors eligible for the NEIL Program   ### Program Overview  Through the program, students will:  [NSWC Crane](https://www.navsea.navy.mil/Home/Warfare-Centers/NSWC-Crane/)   ### Program Details   ## Compensation   ## Peer Leadership & Mentoring  Peer leaders serve as role models and mentors for students who follow them in learning difficult topics and skills, or into a new learning environment. For example, IUPUI hires high-achieving undergraduates as peer leaders to work in collaboration with STEM course instructors to teach student teams through active and collaborative peer-led team learning (PLTL). Instead of traditional recitation in STEM classes, peer leaders mediate weekly problem-solving sessions and facilitate team discussion of concepts and strategies. Peer leaders could also help create a learning community beyond the classroom, for example, to encourage under-represented students to persist and graduate successfully. Peer leaders are enthusiastic and motivated and have the desire to contribute to the learning of their peers. They are catalysts in forming a community of students that can serve as a support group for each other. With time, peer leaders become increasingly independent at performing these tasks and in taking on other leadership roles.  Each NEIL scholar will be placed in peer leadership roles for one semester each year in the NEIL program, and will also enroll in a series of three 1-credit courses in tandem with their leadership and mentoring assignment. The peer leadership work will require 4-8 hours/week during the semester, with a pay rate from $12/hour up to $15/hr for experienced 'superleaders'.   ## Research Assistantships & Internships  Projects will offer undergraduate students the opportunity to engage in a substantive research experience focused on a significant research problem. This is a unique opportunity provided to IUPUI faculty and researchers for mentoring students while conducting pilot projects or testing new techniques and designs. Selected NEIL scholars will be paid $15.00 an hour to work 200 hours during the project (6-8 months of the academic year or 10 weeks in the summer), and meet regularly with the faculty mentor to discuss progress on the project. NEIL scholars must participate in the writing, reflection, and poster presentation activities common to programs of the IUPUI Center for Research & Learning (CRL).  Projects are in certain Navy priority areas, broadly defined:  Typical research projects in these priority areas could be on many topics, such as:   ## Eligibility  To be selected as a NEIL Scholar, each student must be     ### Questions "

    "body": "  ## PhD in Mechanical Engineering  The Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree is a Purdue University degree administered by the Department of Mechanical & Energy Engineering along with the IUPUI Graduate Office here on the IUPUI Campus in Indianapolis, IN .  The department’s Ph.D. program consists of two types of Ph.D. applicants, Direct Ph.D. (DPh.D.) students who have received a baccalaureate degree in mechanical engineering or related engineering programs and Ph.D. students who already have master’s degrees. All students must have earned at least a baccalaureate degree from a U.S.-accredited institution or an equivalent degree from a foreign institution. The requirements for the two types of students are different. Students should know the requirements that apply to them.  Admission to the Ph.D. program is normally granted to those students who have completed a Master of Science degree in an engineering discipline and have met the requirements outlined by the department. Superior students with only a bachelor's degree in an engineering discipline may also be admitted under some circumstances. Prior to registering for the second semester in the Ph.D. program, all students must file a Preliminary Plan of Study signed by four faculty members who have advised the student. Prior to registering for the fourth semester in the Ph.D. program (six semester for students entering the Ph.D. program with only a bachelor's degree), the student must file a final plan of study signed by a faculty advisor, who will supervise the thesis research, and the Ph.D. Advisory Committee. A Ph.D. student is expected to take 21-36 credit hours of course work in addition to Ph.D. dissertation research credit hours and maximum of 30 credit hours earned during Masters. All Ph.D. students take a qualifying examination that covers core courses. This written examination is part of the information used for evaluating a student's potential for completing the Ph.D. program. All Ph.D. students take a preliminary examination that includes an oral part and a written thesis proposal. The purpose of the preliminary examination is to determine if the student is adequately prepared to conceive and undertake a suitable research topic. After the successful completion of the preliminary examination, the thesis research may be conducted under supervision of a mechanical engineering faculty member at IUPUI. Ph.D. research must be original and merit publication in the scholarly literature. The final oral examination is given to determine if the research performed by the Ph.D. student warrants granting the Ph.D. degree.

    "body": "  ## BSMTh Plan of Study  The Bachelor of Science in Music Therapy (BSMTh) curriculum is based on the American Music Therapy Association Professional Competencies. The courses cover musical foundations, clinical foundations, music therapy foundations, and general education. The general education courses in the BSMTh curriculum were specifically selected to meet some of the professional competencies; therefore, students should plan to take those courses rather than substituting other classes. Many of our classes include service learning or experiential learning components.    ACCEPTANCE INTO THE MUSIC THERAPY PROFESSIONAL PROGRAM    While one may state that she or he is a Pre-Music Therapy major and be listed as such in the registrar’s office, a student must apply to move ahead in the professional program. The professional program is defined as starting with Practicum I. Admission to the professional program requires instructor permission. To get permission, the prospective student must apply to the professional program. The application normally takes place at the end of the sophomore year. Prior to application, students must:      Once admitted to the professional program, Music Therapy majors:      Students seeking admission to the Music Therapy professional program must pass a criminal background check before admission is granted. Admission will be automatically denied to any student who fails to either complete the background check or who fails said check. Payment for the background check is the responsibility of the student (approximately $65/year).    Students who pass their initial background check but who later engage in criminal behaviors, which may result in the failure of a subsequent yearly background check, must notify the Music Therapy faculty of the incident so appropriate advising can take place. Engaging in any kind of criminal behavior may jeopardize the student’s ability to advance in the MT professional program, secure an internship, earn appropriate licensure, and/or gain employment as a music therapist. Faculty members are not liable for inaccurate or inappropriate advising arising from the failure of a student to report potential changes in his/her ability to pass a criminal background check.   ### Plans of Study   ### Plan of Study   ### Second Degree Program  Students who already hold a bachelor’s degree in a different field, but who wish to earn their music therapy credential, may do so at IUPUI through our second degree program .

[Music and Arts Technology online application](https://app.getacceptd.com/iupui)   #### 2023-2024 Music Technology Audition dates (applications will be available starting Sept. 1)  Thursday, Nov. 9, 2023 (for Spring 2024 entry) - application deadline Oct. 23 Wednesday, Feb. 7, 2024 (for Fall 2024 entry) - application deadline Jan. 28 Tuesday, Mar. 19, 2024 (for Fall 2024 entry) - application deadline Mar. 4 Saturday, Apr. 20, 2024 (for Fall 2024 entry) - application deadline April 8   ### General Audition Information  Auditions will held in person unless a remote video audition request has been approved.  If you need to request a remote video audition please contact Ms. Julie Wynn, Academic Advisor, Department of Music and Arts Technology julwynn@iupui.edu .  IUPUI policy requires all individuals to wear a mask inside buildings on campus.  The required audition session allows applicants to demonstrate interests, skills, and experiences in 1) music performance and creativity, 2) contemporary music technologies, 3) other arts-related creative, technological, and/or engineering fields, and 4) comprehension of music theory. Applicants are not required to demonstrate in all of these areas, though the audition committee is seeking applicants likely to excel in a degree balancing music technology course-work with music theory and performance/creative skills.  If a student has college credit, a minimum 2.0 GPA is required to apply and audition. A “primary instrument” declared for degree entry is to be used in the audition for a performance/creativity skill demonstration (i.e. a specific instrumental/voice, or “applied music technology” such as laptop/software, midi controllers, etc.). This choice determines a student’s path for individual studio instruction throughout the degree. Regardless of primary instrument, applicants are encouraged to bring computer-based demonstrations to illuminate skills and experiences in areas noted above.**See below for detailed primary instrument/technologies information** Audition requests will be processed only after submitting your application. If an audition is approved and scheduled, you will receive information on how to take two short online placement exams related to the degree program. These online exams must be completed prior to the audition date. Note that 1) your acceptance into IUPUI as a student and 2) the departmental application must both be completed at least three weeks prior to the date of the requested audition.   ### Remote Auditions  If you live within a reasonable distance of Indianapolis, it is expected your audition will be in-person. If excessive travel distance to Indianapolis prohibits an in-person audition, or you require an accommodation due to a documented disability, you may contact the department to request a remote video audition. A remote audition is normally conducted on one of the specified departmental audition session dates. For more info or questions, please contact Ms. Julie Wynn, Academic Advisor, Department of Music and Arts Technology  317-278-3264 julwynn@iupui.edu     ### What to Expect at the Audition  Auditions are planned for 15 minutes. Specific scheduling that day will be determined by our department audition administrator. An applicant should be prepared to address, though demonstrations and/or verbal responses:  Equipment Provided at the Auditions:  Please Note:   ### Specific Audition Requirements - Applied Music Technologies as Primary Instrument  Please demonstrate three different pieces of work representing a variety of experience and skill with music technologies. The applicant must clearly articulate their role(s) in each work and by what means they employed music technology. Essential demonstration items would include exhibiting competency with a fully featured digital audio workstation software, understanding basic concepts of mixing audio, work methods for digital and analog audio, and the ability to articulate standard functions of audio hardware. Experience with related fields of engineering and technology, one or more acoustic instruments, music theory, and/or composition is also to the advantage of the applicant. A student pursuing applied music technology as a performance medium will take private music technology lessons and serve performance, creative, and/or production roles with appropriate department ensembles.   ### Specific Audition Requirements -Instrumentalist or Voice as Primary Instrument  Demonstrate 1) two or three contrasting pieces of repertoire for your instrument, 2) major/minor scales, 3) sight reading as requested (provided at the audition)  Students are encouraged to choose repertoire that best represents their experience, skill level, and artistic range. It is also to the advantage of an applicant to include a brief demonstration of experience/interest with music technologies. If you are auditioning on the following, please note: Percussion: For a percussion audition, you will want to perform a couple of music selections that demonstrate your percussive abilities. That could be a snare drum solo, mallet selection, drum set styles or world percussion demonstrations, or anything that highlights your skill on percussion instruments emphasizing your musicianship. It would be beneficial to present selections of contrasting styles. There is a possibility you would be asked to sight-read. We can have a drum set and/or a marimba/vibraphone available for you to perform on for the audition. Note that in the application  percussionists are asked to specify if they will need a 1) drum set and/or 2) mallet percussion provided for the audition. Guitar: All students should be prepared to demonstrate the following: 1) perform two contrasting pieces of repertoire, 2) perform major scales in 1-2 octaves, 3. Demonstrate site reading abilities (provided at the audition.  Students are encouraged to choose repertoire that best represents their skill level and artistic range. While we do not require specific repertoire or dictate required genres, we do encourage students to select pieces that are focus specifically on guitar skills. (i.e. not simply strumming chords to accompany a song.)  Our most successful students have tended to audition on either classical or jazz pieces. These tend to demonstrate an ability to read standard notation and handle the music that you will be expected to work with at the college level. Some suitable examples are as follows (students are free to choose something from any other style as well, but are encouraged to select examples that demonstrate an equal level of technique/musicianship regardless of the style chosen).  Examples from any of the following collections (or equivalent) would be appropriate audition material: 1) Royal Conservatory of Music Guitar Repertoire Series, Grade 2 or above, 2) 100 Graded Classical Guitar Studies – Fredrick Noad, 3) Classical Studies for Pick Style Guitar – William Leavitt, 4) Jazz Songbook – William Leavitt, 5) Maiden Voyage, Volume 54 – Jamey Aebersold, 6) Killer Joe, Volume 70 – Jamey Aebersold, 7) Barry Galbraith Guitar Solos, Volume 1 and 2.  If you have any further guitar-related questions please contact: John Alvarado, Senior Lecturer of Guitar joalvara@iupui.edu .

    "body": "  ### Mechanical Engineering  Mechanical engineering has its foundation in the basic sciences, including mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and requires an understanding of such areas as solid and fluid mechanics, materials, thermodynamics, heat and mass transfer, manufacturing processes, instrumentation, and control. Mechanical engineers are engaged in a variety of activities including design, manufacturing, research, development, testing, construction, operations, sales, management, consulting, and teaching.  The mechanical engineering curriculum provides a broad base on which to build an engineering career. Traditional subjects in mechanical engineering are complemented by extensive computer experience in such areas as computer-aided design and numerical problem solving. The program's flexibility allows students to specialize in their area of interest through choosing electives. Part-time employment is available to students in the research laboratories of the department. Such experience enhances course work and is particularly valuable to those who later undertake graduate study.   #### Undergraduate Programs   #### Graduate Programs "

    "body": " 1 October 2021  Dear Alumni, Colleagues, Students, and Friends,  Over the 2020-2021 academic year, the Purdue School of Engineering and Technology at IUPUI assembled a broad array of stakeholders including faculty, staff, students, alumni, and corporate partners to form four task forces. These task forces were charged to provide input regarding the update of our School’s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) strategic plan aligned around four indicators: I) Viability and Vitality; II) Education and Scholarship; III) Climate and Intergroup Relations; and IV) Access and Success. Our School has strived to adopt and subsequently apply these four diversity indicators, as defined by Dr. Daryl Smith in her book: Diversity’s Promise for Higher Education: Making it Work , as an organizational framework for our DEI strategic plan.  Download the School's Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Plan for 2021-2026 here.  2021-2026 DEI Plan  BRONZE ASEE Diversity Recognition Program  46% Increase in number of Students of Color  50% Increase in number of Women Students  The School of Engineering and Technology at IUPUI has produced notable DEI accomplishments over the past several years. For example, when comparing 2012 to 2019, we increased the percentage of 1) students of color and 2) women pursing degrees in our School by 46% and 50%, respectively. In 2019, we submitted a self-study document to the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) as part of the ASEE’s Diversity Recognition Program (ADRP). The ADRP was created to publicly recognize those engineering and engineering technology colleges that make significant, measurable progress in increasing the diversity, inclusion, and degree attainment outcomes of their programs. Based on our self-study application, our School was selected, after a national peer-review process, as an inaugural member of ADRP. Moreover, our School was among a small number of engineering colleges/schools nationwide to be recognized as an “exemplar” among the inaugural set of ADRP selectees.  In addition, our School has made progress with respect to reaching parity and diversity of the faculty and staff composition. It is a goal of our School to have no underutilization in any job category as reflected in the Incumbency versus Estimated Availability report we receive on an annual basis from the IUPUI Office of Equal Opportunity. Underutilization exists if the percentage of women and/or minorities in a particular job group is less than 80% of the final availability percentage. We were particularly pleased that we had no underutilization reported in 2020 for several categories as is shown in the snapshot at the end of this document. Although such progress is positive, merely eliminating a prior shortcoming with respect to the 80% ratio does not indicate overall success, but meeting a minimum expectation with respect to goal setting for faculty and staff within our School. We have much work to do to advance shared DEI goals. Moreover, as we continue to invest resources and focus our efforts on achieving DEI goals, we will continue to confront racism, sexism, and other barriers to our excellence and growth as a School of Engineering and Technology.  Our updated DEI plan that follows includes a set of initiatives to help focus attention to create a sense of strategic direction for the School. The plan is not intended to cover all of the operational activities of DEI within our School. The fundamental purpose of our DEI strategic plan is to accelerate progress in areas of specific strength or potential, while capitalizing on our prior investments.  We appreciate your interest and your involvement in shaping the future of our School. With the continued help of our alumni, corporate partners, and friends, we will successfully compete at the highest levels, achieve excellence in our core mission, and enhance our image and reputation. We look forward to sharing with you the progress we are making with each of our DEI initiatives.  Best Wishes,  David J. Russomanno, Ph.D. Dean, Purdue School of Engineering and Technology, IUPUI Professor, Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, IUPUI 799 W. Michigan St. Indianapolis, IN 46202   "
