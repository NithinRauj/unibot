    "body": "  ## Policy on Clinical Faculty Appointments  This document establishes the guidelines for clinical ranks for the IU School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI. This document is supplemental to the administrative policies of Indiana University as documented in the Indiana University Academic Handbook* and the IUPUI Supplement† . The policy stated in the Indiana University Academic Handbook regarding clinical ranks is provided in Appendix A. In addition to IU policy, the School of Liberal Arts establishes these additional guidelines for academic instructional appointments of full-time clinical rank faculty.  Context In 1987, Indiana University approved the concept of non-tenure track faculty appointments for individuals engaged in teaching in or for clinical services in the area of health care. In 1996, other schools were extended the opportunity to create clinical positions where faculty are engaged in other client services. In the School of Liberal Arts, clinical appointments are appropriate for individuals who teach and provide service based on the knowledge and skills for clinical, professional and community work that is directed toward patients, clients, or community members.  Distinctions between Lecturer-Line and Clinical-line Appointments Lecturer Lines According to the IU Academic Handbook, “Lecturers are academic appointees whose primary responsibility is teaching. Lecturers’ assigned responsibilities may include research and service only in support of teaching.” Faculty who primarily teach and provide service to students in undergraduate and graduate programs not focused on clinical, professional, or community settings should be appointed as lecturers. Titles: Lecturer or Senior Lecturer.  Clinical Lines According to the IU Academic Handbook and IUPUI campus policy, “The prefix ‘Clinical’ is used for appointees whose primary duties are teaching students and residents/fellows and providing professional service in the clinical setting.” Consequently clinical appointments in the School of Liberal Arts are appropriate for those whose work primarily involves teaching and providing service in clinical, professional, and/or community contexts.  Clinical appointees contribute to the teaching mission of the School by contributing their professional experience and expertise to the professional preparation and development of the School’s students. Clinical appointees contribute to the service mission of the school through service in their areas of professional expertise, including establishing and maintaining linkages between the School, its students, and the professional and public communities associated with their respective fields. This service may include applied research or applied professional expertise in a manner consistent with the guidelines for *https://www.indiana.edu/~vpfaa/academichandbook/index.php/Main_Page † http://www.iupui.edu/~fcouncil/committees/handbook/supplement_final.pdf applied research for the School of Liberal Arts. Clinical faculty should have expertise and experience not normally found in the tenure-track professoriate. The expectation is that this experience will be introduced into the classroom setting, will benefit students through advising, and will benefit the School through the individual’s professional service activities.  According to the IU Academic Handbook, individuals holding clinical appointments may be involved in research that derives from their clinical/professional experiences, but “continued appointment and advancement in rank must be based on performance in teaching and service.” Titles: Clinical Professor, Associate Clinical Professor, or Assistant Clinical Professor.  Appointment Candidates for clinical positions should be practitioners who have at least three years of appropriate experience in the clinical, professional, or community context as well as academic achievements in keeping with their appointment. [For example, someone hired as a clinical assistant professor of museum collections management should have a minimum of a terminal degree such as the PhD and three years of professional museum experience.]  Term of Appointment Initial appointments for assistant clinical professors shall be one to three years during a probationary period of not more than seven years. Appointments for associate clinical professors and clinical professors will typically be five to seven years, and renewable after review. The process for appointment with probationary status or appointment with a long-term contract at the rank of associate clinical professor or clinical professor shall go through the ordinary procedures for faculty appointments.  The primary duties of faculty members holding clinical rank in the School of Liberal Arts are teaching and providing professional services such as service to students, the department, the school, the university, the community, and the profession.  Teaching load and service requirements will be based on the policy that a full-time teaching load in Liberal Arts is a 4-4 course load for ten-months, with adjustments depending on other expectations of the appointment. In the case of clinical appointments, reallocation of teaching load in support of administrative responsibilities and/or professional service, plus scholarship of teaching and service, will be negotiated with the chair or program director, in consultation with the Dean.  Termination Notice The termination notice shall be announced to the appointee in a time frame consistent with campus policies.  Procedures and criteria Ongoing Reviews Annual Review: Clinical faculty are reviewed annually in accordance with established department or program procedures for full-time faculty of comparable rank. The faculty member shall submit the faculty annual report and other materials required by the department/program for this purpose. Annual merit increases in salary should follow the same guidelines established for other faculty in the department.  Third-Year Review: During the third year after the initial appointment of assistant clinical professor, the department/program primary committee, the chair/director and the school's Promotion and Tenure Committee shall review the appointee, following established procedures for third-year review of tenure-line faculty.  Reappointment Review: As continuing appointment must be based on satisfactory performance in teaching and service, clinical professors and associate clinical professors who have earned long-term appointments shall be reviewed by both the unit primary committee and chair/director prior to another long-term reappointment. The faculty member should provide a personal statement that describes contributions to the teaching and service missions of the school and a CV. External review is not required, but may be solicited, for reappointment after promotion; if solicited, reviews must be included with the request for reappointment that is submitted to the dean.  Longer term contracts offered to non-tenure-track faculty do not carry the same guarantees as tenure. A faculty member in clinical ranks will be reappointed only if his or her performance is judged by the department/program and dean to be effective. Reappointment is also contingent upon the continued existence of the expedient need which created the demand for the position and upon the continued consonance of the position with the academic mission of the department or unit.  Promotion As indicated in the IU Academic Handbook, clinical appointees are not eligible for tenure; however, in order to protect their academic freedom, individuals appointed as assistant clinical professors shall be reviewed and given long-term contracts after a probationary period of not more than seven years. Clinical faculty shall earn the right to a long-term contract on the basis of their excellence only in teaching or professional service, with satisfactory performance in the other, based on the expectations of their appointment.  No later than the start of the sixth year of appointment, assistant clinical professors will submit a dossier for promotion in keeping with the expectations outlined in the IUPUI Dean of Faculties Promotion and Tenure Guidelines for associate clinical professor. This includes independent review by peers external to IUPUI or the department/program. Promotion to Clinical Professor requires independent review by peers external to IUPUI. Reviews for consideration of promotion to associate clinical professor and clinical professor will go through the normal faculty procedures for the school, including review by the primary unit, the school P&T committee, dean, and the campus P&T committee.  Criteria for Promotion The faculty of each unit using Assistant and Associate Clinical Professor appointments shall adopt criteria for promotion that are appropriate to the duties that may be assigned to clinical appointees. Those criteria must follow campus and university standards, be written, available to unit faculty, and filed with the campus academic officer.  The campus standards for excellence for promotion in the clinical professor ranks, as well as the expectations for external peer review, are indicated in the IUPUI P&T Guidelines in the “Summary of Areas of Excellence and Expectations for Various Faculty Categories.” As it states, \"Clinical faculty are required to be excellent in either teaching or service and satisfactory in the other area. They have no formal research requirements for promotion although scholarship is required in their area of excellence.\"  The school standard for promotion for clinical assistant and associate professors is analogous to that for a tenure-line faculty seeking promotion based on teaching or service. Although a national reputation in the area of excellence is not expected, according to the campus P&T guidelines, “Some level of national peer-reviewed dissemination of scholarship is required to document excellence for clinical and tenure track faculty.”  At the end of the probationaryperiod, an unsatisfactory promotion review shall lead to termination of the appointment in keeping with campus policy. In the event of negative reappointment decisions, advance notice must be given per campus policy. Salary increases based on promotion shall follow the school guidelines for tenure-lines for promotion to clinical associate professor and clinical professor.  Sabbatical-like Leaves Clinical faculty are not eligible for University sabbatical leaves, but clinical faculty who have earned promotion (clinical associate professors and clinical professors) may apply for sabbatical-like leaves following the guidelines established by the school for senior lecturers.  School-Supported Grants & Awards Because clinical faculty are evaluated and promoted based only on their work in teaching and service, it is expected that clinical faculty will primarily pursue teaching- or service- focused grants and awards. Consequently clinical faculty may not be the PI or Co-PI for grants requiring school support that are research in nature, unless the research is clearly in support of teaching or service.  Clinical-line faculty are eligible for Trustee Teaching Awards following the same criteria used to evaluate lecturer-line faculty.  School and Department Service Faculty appointed to these ranks are expected to participate in departmental activities that are pertinent to the tasks assigned them. In return, departments are expected to provide the necessary resources for teaching and service responsibilities.  Although the input of non-tenure-track faculty may be solicited on any aspect of departmental business, they should not cast a vote in decisions regarding the hiring, reappointment, promotion, and tenure of tenure-track faculty. However, tenured and tenure-track faculty may establish departmental procedures that allow non-tenure-track faculty to vote on hiring and promotion decisions concerning non-tenure-track faculty of their rank. It is important that the research and teaching missions of the department or unit remain within the purview of faculty on tenured or tenure-track lines. Non-tenure-track faculty may play an important role in determining how best to implement the teaching and service missions of the department, but major decisions concerning curriculum and the overall direction of the department should be the responsibility of tenured and tenure-track faculty.  Furthermore, clinical rank faculty shall be eligible for membership on School, department, and program committees and have full voting rights on all matters except those involving the hiring, review, tenure, and promotion of tenured and tenure- probationary faculty. However, in keeping with IU policy as outlined in the IU Academic Handbook, clinical faculty “voting participation must be structured in a way that reserves at least 60% of voting weight to tenure track faculty.”  Also in keeping with the policy stated in the IU Academic Handbook, clinical faculty are not eligible for academic administrative appointments at and above the department chair level.  Other Rights, Privileges, and Policies The IU Academic Handbook outlines other rights, privileges, and policies that govern clinical line appointments and other non-tenure line appointments.  Approved by the School of Liberal Arts Faculty Assembly: April 18, 2014  APPENDIX A  The following are excerpts from the Indiana University Academic Handbook that pertain specifically to clinical appointments.  NON-TENURE-TRACK FACULTY APPOINTMENTS Clinical Appointments. The prefix “Clinical” is used for appointees whose primary duties are teaching students and residents/fellows and providing professional service in the clinical setting. Titles: Clinical Professor, Associate Clinical Professor, Assistant Clinical Professor; or Clinical Senior Lecturer and Clinical Lecturer.  CLINICAL FACULTY Use of Clinical Appointments Clinical appointments are appropriate for those who work primarily in the clinical setting. Clinical faculty may be involved in research that derives from their primary assignment in clinical teaching and professional service; however, continued appointment and advancement in rank must be based on performance in teaching and service. [EXPLANATION AND COMMENT: Clinical appointees teach and practice full- time in the clinical professional setting. It follows that clinical appointments will be limited to academic units (and departments within academic units) in the professional-client service disciplines. Clinical faculty may contribute to the research efforts of a unit through their clinical work, but they are not expected to do individual research. Faculty who, in addition to teaching and service, have portions of their time allocated to doing research for which they are a principal or co principal investigator, who have research laboratories, or who are otherwise expected to do individual research should be in tenured/ tenure- probationary positions. While individual faculty members hired in tenure- probationary appointments may switch to the clinical appointments during the first five years of their probationary period, such a switch must involve giving up the research component of their faculty work, except for their clinical role in collaborative research trials. Clinical appointments are not intended as a means of retaining tenure-probationary faculty members who will not be able to demonstrate the performance levels in teaching, research, and service required for the granting of tenure.] Rights and Privileges Clinical faculty are expected to follow and be protected by University policies, including those pertaining to faculty hiring and faculty annual reviews. The faculty salary policies of the University, campus, school, and department shall apply to clinical faculty. Clinical faculty have the right to petition the campus faculty board of review. Clinical faculty are not eligible for University sabbatical leave, but schools may provide sabbatical-like leaves for their clinical faculty to provide opportunities for professional learning and collaboration with colleagues. Participation in University and campus faculty governance is governed by the Constitution of the Faculty of Indiana University and the faculty constitutions on each campus. The role of clinical faculty in governance within the unit shall be determined by vote of the tenured and tenure-probationary faculty of the unit, provided that where non- tenure track appointees have voting privileges, their voting participation must be structured in a way that reserves at least 60% of voting weight to tenure track faculty. The academic integrity of the school and its programs ultimately is the responsibility of tenured and tenure-probationary faculty. The rights of clinical faculty and the regulations concerning their roles within each school shall be written and available to the school faculty. A copy of all rights and regulations shall be filed with the campus academic officer and with the campus faculty governance body. [EXPLANATION AND COMMENT: The University Faculty Constitution defines the voting faculty as “all faculty members on tenure or accumulating credit toward tenure.” The Constitution further states that “the voting members of individual campuses may extend voting privileges to others on matters of individual campus significance.” The rationale for the distributions of rights and privileges is to leave the responsibility for the preservation of the most basic academic interests of the institution in the hands of those with the greatest protection of their academic freedom for the purposes of teaching, research, and service including the service of faculty governance; i.e. those with tenure. Non- tenure track appointees otherwise should have as many faculty privileges as is consistent with their qualifications and responsibilities.] Clinical faculty are not eligible for academic administrative appointments at and above the department chair level. [EXPLANATION AND COMMENT: The integrity of the academic programs will be best served by requiring that those individuals holding administrative appointments with direct authority for academic programs have the full range of academic qualifications associated with the tenure track, as well as the fuller protection of academic freedom that tenure provides.] Appointment and Advancement The faculty of each unit using clinical appointments shall decide whether those appointments will be with the titles of Clinical Professor, Associate Clinical Professor and Assistant Clinical Professor, or Clinical Senior Lecturer and Clinical Lecturer. Initial clinical appointments should be at the level appropriate to the experience and accomplishments of the individual. The process for appointment with probationary status or appointment with a long-term contract shall go through the ordinary procedures for faculty appointments. Promotion in rank of Assistant and Associate Clinical Professors should go through the normal faculty procedures appropriate to the unit of the university, including peer review by the primary unit, and campus promotion (and tenure) committees. The faculty of each unit using Assistant and Associate Clinical Professor appointments shall adopt criteria for promotion that are appropriate to the duties that may be assigned to clinical appointees. Those criteria must be written, available to unit faculty, and filed with the campus academic officer. Clinical Lecturers shall be promoted to Clinical Senior Lecturers upon their being appointed to long-term contracts following a probationary period. Protection of Academic Freedom Clinical appointees are not eligible for tenure; however, in order to protect their academic freedom, individuals appointed as clinical faculty shall be given long-term contracts after a probationary period of not more than seven years. The exact mechanism for this shall be determined by the dean and the faculty governance body within each school using clinical appointments and be approved by the chancellor/provost, but the mechanism should be a long-term contract of not less than five years or be some equivalent, such as a rolling three year contract. The criteria for granting long-term contracts after a probationary period shall be analogous to the criteria for granting tenure, except that clinical faculty shall earn the right to a long-term contract on the basis of their excellence only in those responsibilities that may be assigned to them. Each school will establish procedures and specific criteria for review of individuals concerning the renewal of long- term contracts or their equivalent. Clinical faculty appointments during the probationary period shall be subject to the same policies and procedures with respect to appointment, reappointment, non-reappointment, and dismissal as apply to tenure-probationary faculty during the probationary period. After the probationary period, dismissal of a clinical faculty member holding a longer term contract which has not expired may occur because of closure or permanent downsizing of the program in which the faculty member teaches and serves; otherwise, dismissal of such clinical faculty shall occur only for reasons of professional incompetence, serious misconduct, or financial exigency. Non-reappointment of clinical faculty to a new contract term may occur for the foregoing reasons or may occur as well for reason of changing staffing needs of the clinical program. Non-reappointment decisions regarding clinical faculty holding a long-term contract after the probationary period must be made with faculty consultation through processes established by the school’s faculty governance institutions. The jurisdiction of campus faculty grievance institutions includes cases of dismissal and non-reappointment of clinical faculty. [EXPLANATION AND COMMENT: Probationary periods for part-time faculty may be longer than seven years, where regulations adopted by the faculty of the academic unit so provide. University practice requires that probationary periods be served on a continuing basis unless a leave of absence has been applied for and been granted. The University is not obliged to relocate within the institution clinical faculty whose positions are eliminated because of closure, permanent downsizing, or changing staffing needs of their clinical programs. Where an instructional line is converted from non-tenure to tenure track, a clinical faculty member occupying the line may apply for the tenure-track position, but is not guaranteed appointment.]  (University Faculty Council, February 13, 2001; Board of Trustees, May 4, 2001) "

    "body": "  # Japanese students experience Liberal Arts, Indianapolis during visit  Monday, September 17, 2018  Two Japanese students stood onstage in the Cavanaugh Hall basement theatre. One was upset, ready to drop out of college. The other exuberant in her enthusiasm for school, hopping around the stage and grasping her colleague in giant bear hugs as she encouraged her friend to rethink her decision. It’s wasn’t a situation either student realistically contemplated. Below them sat 19 classmates and an assortment of professors and friends who watched the drama unfold. The students were acting out a skit they were assigned in class—a skit that caused them a bit of culture shock. In Japan, it’s not normal for someone to drop out of school. The students were visitors from Hakuoh University, a private school in Oyama, Japan. For nearly fourteen years, Hakuoh University students have visited the IU School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI for ten days of immersed training in the English language and culture. On this very day they were wrapping up their visit. After the class presented their sketches consisting of various social situations, they received certificates, had a pizza and sushi party, and then traveled to North Central High School on the northside of Indianapolis to meet with high school students who are studying or are interested in Japan. Jordan Gusich, Senior Assistant Director for Academic Affairs in the Program for Intensive English (PIE), spent the two weeks guiding the students through class and Indianapolis. Gusich received his MA in English with a concentration on teaching English as a second language (TESOL) from IUPUI and he found his way back to the university several years later when the School of Liberal Arts began PIE in 2014. Meanwhile, Professor Ulla Connor, Director of the International Center for Intercultural Communication, was overseeing intensive language programs for visiting students. As PIE developed, Connor felt it was time to merge her work with the PIE and so worked with Professor Thom Upton, Founding Director of the PIE, and Gusich to transition the running of the Hakuoh University-IUPUI language program to them. During their time in Indianapolis the students visited Newfields, various local restaurants, Bankers Life Fieldhouse where they received a tour of the arena and played some basketball, and saw an Indianapolis Indians baseball game. They also completed a grocery store scavenger hunt, experienced an IUPUI fire drill (an exciting occurrence for the students), and went to Warren Central High School where they met with students, performed a traditional Japanese dance, and did origami. “It’s a cultural exchange,” Gusich said of the high school visits. “The high school students are studying Japanese and they are extremely excited about all things Japan. It’s a time for them to meet Japanese students. It’s a time for the Hakuoh students to experience an American high school.” During the trip, students paired up and stayed with host families. Kyle McClain, an IUPUI alum, was one of the first students to visit Hakuoh while studying Japanese. He now works for Hakuoh university and returns to IUPUI each fall with the students as a chaperone and translator, helping the students navigate their new surroundings. “You have 21 students. For many, it was their first opportunity to travel abroad,” Gusich said. “Oyama is a small region. Just making the decision to study abroad and stepping on that plane is an incredible experience for them.” Gusich notes that building international relationships is part of IUPUI’s mission, and the partnership that has grown between Hakuoh University and the School of Liberal Arts is a realization of the mission’s goals. Not only is the experience positive for the Japanese students, but their interaction with IUPUI’s own students opens their American peers up to the potential of international study. This partnership is now growing into the community, as witnessed by the students’ visits to both North Central and Warren Central High Schools, visits that were sponsored by the Japan-American Society of Indiana with the goal of helping to foster friendships between students in Indiana and Japan. “It plants a seed that there is a world out there and it’s worth exploring,” Gusich said. “It’s ok to get out of your comfort zone and try some new things in a different place, a different culture.” “For a lot of these students its life changing. It’s IUPUI. It’s Indianapolis. It’s the families who take them in,” he said. “It’s something they will remember for a very long time.”  [Program for Intensive English](https://www.iupui.edu/~inpie/)  [Japan-American Society of Indiana](http://www.japanindiana.org/english/)     "

Lectures will focus on the ways jazz has developed as a worldwide phenomenon; Indianapolis and its Jazz heritage on Indiana Avenue; and the broader influence and impact of Jazz on popular culture situated in the context of its origins within Black culture.  Dixon will lead a youth-focused series of interactive activities titled Jazz in the 21st Century with Indianapolis Public School students and in conjunction with an Africana Studies/CASC faculty member. This will include an interactive jazz performance program designed for school-aged children, and a booklet written by Dixon and Africana Studies faculty for school-aged students on jazz as Cultural Heritage.  This audience-interactive jazz performance program is designed to take the audience member through the history of jazz using a small jazz ensemble, historic jazz film footage on two screens flanked on both sides of the ensemble, a poet to narrate, and dynamic lighting to enhance the performance experience. This series will be specifically for IUPUI students, staff, and faculty and two performances are scheduled for Spring 2024.

    "body": "  # Advancing Racial and Ethnic Equity in Health Care Access: COVID Pandemic Changes to Medicaid  David Craig  February, 2023  David Craig   ### Current Situation  As the COVID-19 pandemic set in, Medicaid beneficiaries across the United States gained protection in the form of “continuous enrollment.” With additional federal funding, the state of Indiana not only kept Medicaid members continuously enrolled since April 2020, but also suspended the premiums and copayments that members pay for the Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP), which provides coverage to low-income adults. As a result, HIP enrollment increased by 90% as of Jan. 2023 to over 800,000 people. Starting in April 2023, Medicaid rules return to normal. Based on a pre-pandemic community-engaged study of HIP, our research team knows that many people will struggle to navigate these rules, potentially leading to tens or hundreds of thousands of eligible people losing health benefits.   ### The Project  With the return to normal Medicaid rules, the research team of Dr. Elaine Hernandez, Assistant Professor of Sociology, IU; Dr. Ivan Douglas Hicks, Pastor, First Baptist Church North Indianapolis; and Dr. Craig are launching a statewide study, funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. The team seeks to understand how enrollment patterns and health care utilization may have changed for HIP members from minoritized racial and ethnic groups. The three-year suspension of key administrative burdens offers a “natural experiment” to examine shifts in enrollment and utilization trends. Interviews with HIP members will spotlight people’s health experiences during continuous enrollment as well as new challenges with the return of program rules. Our community-valued research will engage community leaders in cities across Indiana to map the local institutions through which HIP-eligible people do or do not access health care to identify effects of structural racism on health equity.  This project depends on many community and university partners and builds on previous research. Our 2019 study engaged current and potential HIP members for their expertise on how HIP was working or not working as they sought to enroll in the program and use its health benefits. Community partners, First Baptist Church North Indianapolis and Shepherd Community Center, centered the experiences of Black beneficiaries. Participants identified important helps, including direct assistance from navigators, social workers, and care coordinators along with ongoing support from trusted community organizations. They also identified hindrances, including a series of administrative burdens from application processes, document handling, and financial payments to other barriers with transportation, stigma, and stress.  Dr. Craig and Prof. Pamela Napier (Visual Communication Design, Herron) were awarded the 2020-21 IUPUI Bantz Community Fellowship to advance on one of the Recommendations from the 2019 study. We partnered with congregational leaders, advocacy groups, and insurance outreach teams to co-create a suite of brochures to raise public awareness and visually communicate how to get, keep, and use the medical, vision, and dental benefits of HIP Plus.   ### Humanitarian Impact  The Healthy Indiana Plan’s name promises a healthier state. If every eligible Hoosier can get, keep, and use the more comprehensive HIP Plus plan, members can benefit from regular wellness care and chronic disease management along with the financial security of avoiding onerous bills and medical bankruptcy. Better health outcomes and fewer expensive trips to the Emergency Department can benefit everyone. This research will make recommendations for HIP program changes and offer paths toward remediation for other systemic problems discovered that impede better community health.   ### Results / Data  A public awareness campaign, called Get HIP, was created to visually communicate how to get, keep, and use the medical, vision, and dental benefits of HIP Plus.  Brochures for the Get HIP campaign, designed and produced by Rachel Knierman, Herron School of Design student. Covers are shown below.     ### Featured Media  [“Why Millions of People Might Get Kicked Off of Medicaid in April,”](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/why-millions-of-people-might-get-kicked-off-of-medicaid-in-april)  [Communicating Changes to Medicaid: Ways You Can Help Hoosiers Stay Insured](https://www.ckfindiana.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/CKF-Medicaid-Toolkit-rev2-2.24.23.pdf)   ### Publications  Our 2019 Research Report documents HIP members’ accounts of barriers in the program, health care system, and neighborhoods. According to Indiana state data, under pre-pandemic rules, 1) one in four HIP enrollees lost coverage each year, and 2) African-Americans were under-enrolled in the more comprehensive HIP Plus health plan, compared to other racial and ethnic groups. Each community partner produced a video sharing personal stories of how relationships with community organizations and congregations help people enroll and stay connected as they navigate and advocate through these barriers.

We are grateful to the first-hand experts, the HIP members, who shared their lived experiences and problem-solving talents. Community leaders affiliated with First Baptist Church North Indianapolis and Shepherd Community Center grounded this research in the neighborhoods they serve. Health advocates and pastors from the #HealthyMe Learning Community as well as partners from the Center for Interfaith Cooperation, Covering Kids and Families of Indiana, MDwise, and Anthem reviewed and improved Get HIP campaign brochures. IUPUI students from Herron, Liberal Arts, and Public Health have contributed their visual communication design and quantitative data analysis skills. Members of the Outreach Committee of the All Hands on Deck Medicaid Coalition wrote and designed the Community Toolkit: Communicating Changes to Medicaid. The Collaborative Community of Practice, including the four churches, Allen Chapel AME, Broadway United UMC, Crossroads AME, and First Baptist Church North Indianapolis, along with Rev. Shonda Nicole Gladden, Good to the SOUL, the IU Health Congregational Care Network, and the Monon Collaborative of Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute, models the heart for social justice and the partnership in common purpose needed for healthier communities. We acknowledge, in advance, the many new community partners whose expertise is the foundation of community-engaged research. "

    "body": "  # Dr. Paul R. Mullins recognized with high honor by IUPUI  Wednesday, March 09, 2022  In late February of 2022, the Office of the Chancellor at IUPU announced that Dr. Paul R. Mullins of the Anthropology Department in the IU School of Liberal Arts was chosen to receive the Chancellor’s Professor Award – only one of two chancellor’s professorships awarded across the IUPUI campus for the year.  Being named a Chancellor’s Professor is the most distinguished appointment an individual faculty member can attain at IUPUI. The award was created to recognize senior faculty members who display a record of extensive accomplishment and leadership in teaching, research, and campus service – all qualities embodied and demonstrated by Dr. Mullins’ remarkable career.  Paul Mullins is an historical archaeologist who studies the intersection of materiality and the color line, focusing on the relationship between racism, consumption, and urban displacement. His scholarship has included archaeological excavations, documentary research, and oral history, and his scholarship has spanned the globe. The research on the history of our own IUPUI campus produced an invaluable oral history collection, The Price of Progress: IUPUI, the Color Line, and Urban Displacement, which was co-edited with community partner Glenn White. The book illuminates the legacy of urban renewal and the erasure of African-American life in the near-Westside.  In addition to being widely published in his field, Dr. Mullins’ important contributions to the field of Anthropology have garnered much admiration and earned prestigious honors. In 2012 Paul was awarded a Fulbright Scholar grant to teach and do research at the University of Oulu in Finland. In 2017, along with his Anthropology Department colleague Dr. Hyatt, Mullins was named one of the inaugural Charles R. Bantz Chancellor’s Community Fellows for their work examining the history and material culture in a series of Indianapolis neighborhoods that have been effaced, ignored, or misrepresented in public discourse.  The award will be official conferred at a ceremony in April, and it will see Dr. Mullins become just the 12th recipient from the IU School of Liberal in the award’s history. Far more than an honorific, Chancellor’s Professors enjoy a special consultative relationship with the IUPUI chancellor and often serve as mentors for colleagues as well as resources for faculty development, student learning, and professional research and service.  Dr. Mullins has made translational research knowledge available to professionals, researchers, students, and communities around the world. His work has been an exemplary model of IUPUI faculty members translating research in to practice for the betterment of their fields and communities. The IU School of Liberal Arts congratulates Dr. Paul Mullins on being named Chancellor’s Professor and are proud to call him a colleague and friend. "

    "body": "  # Museum Studies student brings President Harrison’s 1891 journey to life in exhibit  By: Josh P. Flynn  Thursday, March 15, 2018  A metal plate with intricate carvings representing the state of Colorado. An acrostic poem from Tucson, Arizona, complete with a cactus painted on the paper. Ribbons made of silk and wheat. These are just a few of the items United States citizens gave President Benjamin Harrison during a 31 day 10,000 mile trek through the South and West. Now they are on display at the Benjamin Harrison Presidential Site in an exhibit curated by Allison Kraft, a museum studies grad student within the IU School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI. “A Trip to Unify” tells the story of President Harrison’s 1891 journey. He gave 150 speeches to ignite the public’s patriotism. As Kraft read through the speeches she became inspired and wanted to show visitors each step of the president’s route. “I wanted them to experience those words as well,” she said. Kraft, the Benjamin Harrison Presidential Site’s 2017 New Century Curatorial Fellow, fell in love with history and museums as a child when her grandparents took her to visit the Fithian House in Danville, Illinois. William Fithian was a local physician and politician who was also friends with Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln stayed in the house on visits while practicing law and also gave a speech from the balcony during his senate campaign. “It was the first place I had ever visited where someone of such historical significance had once been,” Kraft remembered. “I could not believe I was walking where Abraham Lincoln once walked.” Before joining the museum studies program, Kraft majored in history and political science and earned a minor in art history at Purdue. She also began interning and working at various museums such as the Indiana State Museum, George Washington’s Mt. Vernon in Virginia, and the Eiteljorg Museum of Native Americans and Western Art in Indianapolis. This past summer she was the curatorial graduate intern at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, MI. “[These experiences] opened my eyes to what it means to not only preserve artifacts but also the stories behind the artifacts,” she said.  “One of the great strengths of our program in the School of Liberal Arts is the relationships we have with area museums and the opportunities our students have to gain skills, work with museum professionals, and build their portfolios,” said Elizabeth Kryder-Reid, professor of anthropology and museum studies. “Our students build on the curriculum’s solid foundation in collections, education, and exhibits to tackle complex projects like this exhibit.” “Not only do we get the chance to intern and work at these museums, but I’ve been to visit collection and conservation spaces within the museums with my classmates and professors to learn from professionals,” Kraft said. “Our professors have been incredible at providing us with these chances to learn beyond the classroom. Indianapolis has been absolutely incredible in the learning process and the experiences I have been fortunate to have. I’ve been so happy to go to school and work in this city.”  Kraft drew on those experiences and classroom learning as she began to build the Presidential Site exhibit. Working closely with curator Jennifer Capps, Kraft was responsible for choosing the artifacts on display, writing the narrative labels, and developing the exhibit layout. She described the president’s journey as a whistle stop tour. Some stops were very brief. She compares the trip to modern campaigning. While patriotism was the overarching theme of the journey, President Harrison also spoke on regional topics like coming together as a country in the deep South and building a larger, stronger navy and expanding international trade and commerce in the West. Presidential artifacts in the exhibit include an itinerary signed by all members of the presidential party, a ceremonial wooden button the first lady pressed to launch the second USS Monterey vessel, and many newspapers and photos documenting the trip.  “When visitors visit the exhibit it is my hope that they will not only learn more about this 10,000 mile journey but they leave feeling inspired, encouraged, and feel proud to be an American because some of these speeches are incredible and they speak with such patriotism,” Kraft said.

    "body": "  # Mellon Foundation Awards Grant for New Landback Universities Project  Thursday, August 04, 2022  IUPUI and the IU School of Liberal Arts is pleased to announce the receipt of an award in the amount of $149,662 from the Mellon Foundation for the Landback Universities project (landbackuniversities.org). Centering the principles of LANDBACK , a movement that locates liberation for Indigenous people and people of color in “putting Indigenous Lands back into Indigenous hands,” Landback Universities seeks to collaboratively develop a vision of higher education rooted in collective stewardship of the lands on which colleges and universities sit through humanistic inquiry.  [LANDBACK](https://landback.org/)  Recognizing that there are myriad ways that colonialism operates through our institutions, Landback Universities focus on humanities-based approaches to land relations because rematriation of land lies at the heart of decolonization. In this context, Landback Universities has three objectives: 1) explore how to facilitate conversations between faculty, administrators, staff, and students to develop strategies for meaningfully decolonizing university operations; 2) develop and disseminate recommendations that colleges and universities can implement to return stewardship of university lands to Native nations they have dispossessed; 3) serve as a proof-of-concept for using these methods to identify strategies that promote Indigenous sovereignty throughout the diverse range of offices, operations, and units that comprise universities.  Humanities-based approaches to land relations address these issues through scholarship in Native American and Indigenous Studies, Political Science, History, Anthropology, and Ethnic Studies. These disciplines merge critical thinking with practices of ethnography and auto-ethnography, textual interpretation and discourse analysis, archival research, and community-engaged social justice research. Together they allow us to understand land relations not just as political and legal sovereignty but as an Indigenous-centered worldview.  Landback Universities is co-led by Jennifer Guiliano —Associate Professor of History, Native American and Indigenous Studies, and American Studies in the IU School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI; Megan Red Shirt-Shaw (Oglala Lakota)—Director of Native Student Services at the University of South Dakota and Doctoral Student in Organizational Leadership at the University of Minnesota; Roopika Risam—Associate Professor of Film and Media Studies and Faculty, Digital Humanities and Social Engagement Cluster at Dartmouth College; and Elizabeth Rule (enrolled citizen of the Chickasaw Nation)—Assistant Professor of Critical Race, Gender, and Culture Studies at American University.

Characteristics of the Program  a.   Campus(es) Offering Program—Joint Degree Shared by  Indiana University East Indiana University/Purdue University Indianapolis Indiana University Kokomo Indiana University Northwest Indiana University South Bend Indiana University Southeast  b.   Scope of Delivery—Statewide c.   Mode of Delivery—100% Online d.   Other Delivery Aspects—None e.   Academic Unit Offering Program—varies by campus:  IU East—School of Humanities and Social Sciences IUPUI—School of Liberal Arts IU Kokomo—School of Humanities and Social Sciences IU Northwest—College of Arts and Sciences IU South Bend—Ernestine M. Raclin School of the Arts IU Southeast—School of Arts and Letters  2 . Rationale for the Program  a.    Institutional Rationale (Alignment with Institutional Mission and Strengths)  a. Program Goals:  The coursework in the Graduate Certificate in Communication Studies will combine the applied skills and theoretical knowledge in the discipline of Communication Studies. The certificate will serve two primary audiences:  The Graduate Certificate in Communication Studies will support the reach and quality of Indiana’s dual-credit courses by providing:  In addition to the economic and practical advantages of its online format, communication professionals will be attracted to the practical dimensions of the curriculum, which includes:  The certificate allows instructors of introductory college-level communication courses to partially fulfill the faculty educational standards of many post-secondary institutions. These requirements usually include a master’s degree in the discipline, or a master’s degree in another field (e.g., education) plus 18 hours in the discipline. With the increased attention that the Higher Learning Commission and other accrediting bodies are giving to the issue of faculty qualifications, current faculty are seeking ways to meet the requirement.  This certificate answers the charge of the Indiana University Bicentennial Strategic Plan to provide an excellent education that promotes retention and completion through innovative online instruction that accommodates the work schedules and family demands of working Hoosiers.  [Indiana University Bicentennial Strategic Plan](https://strategicplan.iu.edu/plan/education.html)  With a focus on extending the reach of dual-credit and community college instruction in high-demand introductory level courses, this MA meets IU’s charge as a public university, which the Bicentennial Strategic Plan states as follows:  IU is a public university in a deep sense; it exists to benefit all the people of the state, and the world beyond, and has a charge to continue its long tradition of engagement in the economic, social, environmental, and cultural life of all Hoosiers. This charge applies to all IU campuses, and it has special significance for the regional campuses. These campuses’ communities and regions rely on their respective campuses for undergraduate and professional education that addresses regional needs.  The Graduate Certificate in Communication Studies is proposed as a joint degree program by six IU campuses—East, IUPUI, Kokomo, Northwest, South Bend and Southeast. By design, this joint program provides efficiencies of scale while maintaining the unique characteristics of the regional campuses.  The December 2014, Indiana University Bicentennial Strategic Plan identified the integration of new educational technologies and collaborative platforms and the development of a robust program of online education as essential tools to ensure that the university and its faculty continue to serve the citizens of the state of Indiana.  [Indiana University Bicentennial Strategic Plan](https://strategicplan.iu.edu/plan/education.html)  As a part of this initiative, the university developed IU Online to serve as administrative home “coordinating and catalyzing IU’s efforts in this area.” The plan summarizes the specific benefits as follows:  Online and hybrid delivery allow IU through IU Online to expand its offerings across campuses in a cost-effective way, through developing systems of shared online resources. IU will complete through IU Online a university-wide framework for online education, to enhance instructional quality and support, and create scalable economies in course and program delivery for all campuses.  See Appendix 1 for web addresses to:  • Indiana University Bicentennial Strategic Plan • January 2016 IU Online: A Collaborative Model for Online Education at Indiana University .  [Indiana University Bicentennial Strategic Plan](https://strategicplan.iu.edu/plan/education.html)  [January 2016 IU Online: A Collaborative Model for Online Education at Indiana University](https://uaa.iu.edu/academic/ooe/docs/ooe_model.pdf)  b.   State Rationale  •     How does this program address state priorities as reflected in the ICHE’s 2016 strategic plan Reaching Higher, Delivering Value.  [Reaching Higher, Delivering Value.](http://www.in.gov/che/files/77185_2016_RHDV_Report_Master.pdf)  The proposed collaborative Graduate Certificate in Communication Studies will address each one of the four goals cited in Reaching Higher, Delivering Value.  I.             Completion—The collaborative Graduate Certificate in Communication Studies is designed to improve the instruction in college-level Communication courses taught in Indiana high schools as a part of the dual-credit program and community colleges. These programs give students a head start on their college studies, bank credits and prepare students for success in their first semesters of college enrollment, which is essential to timely progress to degree and on time graduation.  II.            Competency—As mentioned above the collaborative Graduate Certificate in Communication Studies will serve instructors teaching introductory college-level communication courses. Presentation and communication skills are essential for  success in college courses across the curriculum.  III.           Career—The collaborative Graduate Certificate in Communication Studies stacks with the pending collaborative online Master in Liberal Studies and is tailored to the specific needs of dual-credit communication instructors.  It provides both the graduate level instruction in communication and a path to a Master’s degree that the Higher Learning Commission requires for instructors in college-level courses. The online delivery method will allow teachers to integrate these graduate courses into their regular teaching schedule and /or take courses over the summers.  IV.          Delivering Value—While 100% online delivery mode will allow teachers to further their education with minimal disruption to their professional and family lives, the courses they teach to high school students and community college students are affordable, transferable credits that students can apply towards completion of both two- and four-year college degrees.  c.     Evidence of Labor Market Need  i.   National, State, or Regional Need  •    Is the program serving a national, state, or regional labor market need?  The collaborative online Graduate Certificate in Communication Studies together with the online Master in Liberal Studies will allow dual-credit instructors in introductory communication courses taught in high schools and at community colleges to meet the instructor qualifications standards of the Higher Learning Commission, the regional accrediting body for the Upper-Midwest. Recent changes in HLC practice and other accrediting bodies across the country will likely create steady demand for these online programs.  ii.   Preparation for Graduate Programs or Other Benefits  •    Does the program prepare students for graduate programs or provide other benefits to students besides preparation for entry into the labor market?  This certificate is designed to serve secondary and community college instructors.  It is unlikely that many of these students will opt to apply for a Ph.D. program in the area of Communication Studies, but course work required for the certificate could be used to prepare a student for further communication study at the MA level, for example, with the appropriate mentoring.  iii.   Summary of Indiana DWD and/or U.S. Department of Labor Data  •    Summarize the evidence of labor market demand for graduates of the program as gleaned from employment projections made by the Indiana Department of Workforce Development and/or the U.S. Department of Labor?  See Appendix 2: Brief Market and Demand Analysis  iv.   National, State, or Regional Studies  •    Summarize any national, state, or regional studies that address the labor market need for the program.  In an emergency presentation to the Indiana Commission for Higher Education on October 8, 2015, two representatives from the Center for Excellence in Leading and Learning, Dr. Janet Boyle, Executive Director and Tyonka M. Perkins, Interim Director of Early College presented findings about the potential impact of these HLC changes based on a credential analysis of Indiana, dual-credit instructors. Boyle and Perkins found that:  •    Only 30% of current instructors hold an M.A. in their field; •    1,193 instructors hold M.A.T.s, and other graduate degrees in the field of education, but lack the 18 graduate credit hours in the specific content area in which they teach; •    A further 600 instructors have neither a Master’s degree nor the requisite content area credit hours. •    In all, more than 43,000 Indiana students currently take dual-credit courses with instructors who do not meet the HLC standards.  To meet the needs of these instructors, and by extension, their students, the Office of Online Education and the Advanced College Program of Indiana University identified the highest priority dual-credit courses in terms of statewide enrollments, and asked departments and campuses to consider developing online graduate certificates that will satisfy HLC standards for content area instruction. Communication courses are among the most highly enrolled dual-credit courses in the state, and there are hundreds of dual-credit teachers across the state that could complete the collaborative online Graduate Certificate in Communication Studies to meet HLC standards.  See Appendix 2: Brief Market and Demand Analysis  3. Cost of and Support for the Program a.    Costs i.   Faculty and Staff- This program will be offered by current IUPUI faculty in collaboration with other faculty on the participating campuses. IUPUI faculty currently offer four graduate online courses with another 3 scheduled for spring and have the capacity to support this certificate. The Department of Communication Studies is a leader in online course development and delivery. The participating faculty will collaborate carefully to ensure careful course scheduling to maximize both face-to-face and online enrollments. ii. Facilities- The program will rely on existing facilities. iii.   Other Capital Costs (e.g. Equipment)- No new equipment will be needed to support this program. b.   Support i.   Nature of Support (New, Existing, or Reallocated)- Department of Communication Studies faculty are currently teaching online graduate courses. This program will not take existing faculty away from undergraduate courses. This program has the potential to boost graduate enrollment at the MA level by attracting new students to our online courses. ii.   Special Fees above Baseline Tuition – IU Online assesses an online fee per credit hour. This is the case for online courses regardless of the implementation of this proposed certificate program.  3. Similar and Related Programs  a.    List of Programs and Degrees Conferred  i.   Similar Programs at Other Institutions  Campuses offering (on-campus or distance education) programs that are similar:  •    CHE staff will summarize data from the Commission’s Program Review Database on headcount, FTE, and degrees conferred for similar programs in the public sector, as well as information on programs in the non-profit and proprietary sectors, to the extent possible.  ii.   Related Programs at the Proposing Institution  •    CHE staff will summarize data from the Commission’s Program Review Database on headcount, FTE, and degrees conferred for related programs at the proposing institution.  b.   List of Similar Programs Outside Indiana  •     If relevant, institutions outside Indiana (in contiguous states, MHEC states, or the nation, depending upon the nature of the proposed program) offering (on-campus or distance education) programs that are similar:  Southern New Hampshire University offers a MA in Communication completely online. SNHU is one of a growing number of campuses that specialize in online degree programs in as few as 15 months. The curriculum of the MA emphasizes media, marketing, and public relations—a different focus than our general communication MA with the primary audience of high school teachers.  [Southern New Hampshire University](https://www.snhu.edu/online-degrees/masters/ma-in-communication)  Arizona State University offers an 18-credit hour online graduate certificate in Technical Communication. The curriculum focuses on areas such as web authoring and technical editing. This does not overlap (or compete) with our proposed curriculum.  [Arizona State University](https://asuonline.asu.edu/online-degree-programs/certificates/technical-communication-grad-certificate)  Bowling Green State University (Ohio) offers an online graduate certificate in Technical Writing. This does not duplicate our proposed certificate in Communication Studies. However, with Ohio joining the Midwest Student Exchange Program, our online certificate could be an attractive program at an affordable tuition rate.  [Bowling Green State University](https://www.bgsu.edu/arts-and-sciences/english/scientific-technical-communication/online-graduate-certificate.html)  c.     Articulation of Associate/Baccalaureate Programs  Not Applicable.  d.   Collaboration with Similar or Related Programs on Other Campuses  •     Indicate any collaborative arrangements in place to support the program.  The collaborative online Graduate Certificate in Communication Studies will be listed with the other 100% online programs posted at IU Online web portal and will receive marketing and recruitment support from the Office of Online Education (OOE). OOE staff and representatives will be trained to answer initial responses regarding the program and refer prospective students to the campuses for follow-up. OOE will partner with this academic program to provide marketing and recruitment campaigns that reinforce the overall recruitment message and maximize the utilization of OOE, campus, and program resources. OOE will provide effectiveness tracking of marketing campaigns and establish Return on Investment for marketing and recruitment of IU Online students.  In addition, OOE will provide a suite of services for online students. The office provides 24/7 support for students via phone, email and chat. During the 2016-17 academic year, OOE is rolling out the following support for students pursuing an IU Online program:  o  onboarding/orientation to online education at IU, o  coaching and mentoring services, o  math and writing tutoring, o  internship/ coop management, and o  career services.  OOE has entered into partnership arrangements with providers on several IU campuses, and these offices will take the lead in providing services to students in 100% online collaborative degrees.  In addition, these partnerships will also coordinate student conduct, ADA compliance, and student advocacy for students enrolled at multiple campuses. With regard to student conduct and student grievances, OOE will facilitate conversations among campuses, and, to the extent possible, seek to resolve the issue using existing campus processes  4. Quality and Other Aspects of the Program Each campus will be responsible for ensuring that all courses taught in this program will be designed to meet or exceed Quality Matters standards. Instructors developing and/or revising courses for online delivery will be proficient in the use of the QM rubric as applied to online course design. (Each campus center for teaching and learning will provide training in the application of the QM rubric, and eDS instructional designers will provide guidance.)  a.    Credit Hours Required/Time To Completion  Working professionals will be able to complete the 18 credit hour Graduate Certificate in Communication Studies in 15-18 months of consecutive part-time enrollment. Students who can take more than one course at a time may complete the certificate more quickly.  •     Credit hours required for the program and how long a full-time student will need to complete the program  See Appendix 3: for a sample curriculum list  b.   Program Competencies or Learning Outcomes  Upon completion of the certificate, students will able to:  1.   Deploy innovative strategies for teaching communication. 2.   Employ effective and ethical communication practices in professional, academic, and personal settings. 3.   Apply critical perspectives to production and consumption of media messages.  c.     Admissions Requirements:  Admission criteria will follow the procedures in place at the campus of enrollment with the following certificate specific criteria. •     Bachelors degree •     3.0 minimum undergraduate GPA; •     Official transcripts from each undergraduate institution; •     250-word personal statement explaining background and reasons for entering the program . Because the collaborative online Certificate in Communication Studies is distinct from related on-campus or online programs, admission to this program does not imply admission to any other program, including on-campus graduate programs offered by collaborating campuses.

    "body": "  # Service-learning is unifying people and cultures all over the world  Tuesday, June 13, 2023  English as foreign language (EFL) teachers from 24 countries, including Ukraine, Fiji, Senegal, Honduras, and Thailand, traveled to Indianapolis for two weeks earlier this spring to experience first-hand how to use service-learning techniques to teach the English language in their own regions.  Hosted by the IU School of Liberal Arts International Center for Intercultural Communication (ICIC) , the “Using Service-Learning to Teach 21st Century Skills to English Language Learners” exchange program was sponsored by the United States Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs Office of English Language Programs and was implemented in cooperation with FHI 360. The program was designed to share this community-focused style of education to break down international barriers, bring cultures together, and unify people through the power of the English language.  [International Center for Intercultural Communication (ICIC)](https://liberalarts.iupui.edu/centers/icic/)  Joining ICIC was a collaborative academic team from IUPUI, including representatives from the IU School of Liberal Arts Program for Intensive English, Office of International Affairs, IU School of Education, and the Institute for Engaged Learning. Together, they taught participants how to merge 21st century skills growth (critical thinking, collaboration, communication, creativity), global awareness, and digital literacy, community-based service-learning to ultimately increase English language skills in classrooms around the world.  “The teachers chosen for this program were among the best in their regions, and it was such a pleasure to interact with them, to better understand each of their teaching situations and how service-learning can strengthen both English learning and their communities,” said Ulla Connor, Founding Director, ICIC and Chancellor’s Professor of English. “To be chosen to host this exchange program speaks to ICIC’s longstanding reputation for applying intercultural communication research to teaching practice with both local and global impact.”   ### Meet Kateryna Filatova  A freelance English teacher in the town of Dnipro, Ukraine, Kateryna (Kate) Filatova’s high school students were already learning foundational English skills through virtual e-learning so when she received her invitation to the exchange program, she was thrilled. “It was a big surprise! I had no clue what service-learning was, so I thought, wow!” said Kate Filatova. “This is something new, something as a teacher I don’t know about.”  Filatova has taught language at the university level and received CELTA (Certificate in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) certification, the most widely recognized English teaching qualification in the world. She currently teaches Ukrainian high schoolers as part of two U.S. Department of State-funded programs, the English Access Microscholarship Program (Access) and Learning English, Overcoming Stress.  [English Access Microscholarship Program (Access)](https://exchanges.state.gov/non-us/program/english-access-microscholarship-program)  Dnipro is the largest city near the frontline of the war and has become the center for medical health, caring for soldiers. The decision to leave her husband and young child for three weeks during an ongoing war did not come easily. “It was a really hard decision for me. The situation is not stable, and you never know what’s going to happen. “The year was harsh,” recalled Filatova. “Then, I thought, yes, I need to take it because I could contribute to my community. I can contribute to other teachers to bring something new to them.”   ### What is service-learning?  A service-learning approach teaching takes instruction outside the classroom walls and straight into the community. It is an effective way to engage students who are studying English because it provides meaningful context for language practice by ----making students active participants in finding solutions community needs. Students reflect on their values, develop new perspectives, and then use English to communicate their ideas, thoughts, and feelings about the experience and their own growth.  It was the opportunity of a lifetime for Filatova and her international peers―not only to come to the United States but also to learn a new approach to teaching the English language and to develop an international support network.  Speaking to the group, Dr. Hilary Kahn , IUPUI Associate Vice Chancellor for International Affairs, said, “Service-learning presents an extraordinary pedagogical framework that can enable our visiting educators to draw students’ attention to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to end poverty, protect the planet, and enjoy peace and prosperity for all, in ways that are meaningful in their own contexts.”  [Dr. Hilary Kahn](https://liberalarts.iupui.edu/departments/anthropology/directory/hilary-kahn/)   ### Experiencing service-learning first-hand  Keiko Kuriyama , Professor of Japanese in the Department of World Languages and Cultures, equipped participants with a comprehensive approach to launching a service-learning project, from syllabus to project development, to course activities. Dr. Robert Bringle , co-founder of the IUPUI Center for Service & Learning also shared current trends in service-learning, including an evolution from just “service” mentality to one of “community engagement and cooperation.” Drs. Cristina Santamaría Graff and Jeremy Price , from the IU School of Education at IUPUI, led a training session as part of a community partnership that brings educators and families together at Indianapolis Public Schools (IPS) Brookside Elementary School. Participants received training in two specific frameworks for developing critical and transformative service-learning in their own communities. “Dr. Price and I are grateful to have had the opportunity to work with so many amazing colleagues doing transformative work all over the world,” says Dr. Santamaría Graff. The group also visited an influential local partner, ProAct Indy , a community nonprofit that serves diverse youth. Founder and CEO Derrin Slack led an interactive session that introduced participants to the ways ProAct Indy crosses social, racial, and economic boundaries through meaningful service projects and social equity training.  [Keiko Kuriyama](https://liberalarts.iupui.edu/programs/translation-studies/directory/keiko-kuriyama/)  [Dr. Robert Bringle](https://philanthropy.iupui.edu/people-directory/bringle-robert.html)  [Cristina Santamaría Graff](https://education.iupui.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/santamaria-graff-cristina.html)  [Jeremy Price](https://education.iupui.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/price-jeremy.html)  [ProAct Indy](https://www.proactindy.org/)   #### Sharing the knowledge  Equipped with a new foundation of understanding for service-learning, Kate was filled with inspiration and motivation as she traveled home to Ukraine. Her friends and colleagues were eager to know all she learned about service-learning while in the United States. One of her students is a university music instructor. Kate recounts, “I told her about my experience, and she told me how her students went to a blood donor center to play the bandura (a traditional Ukrainian instrument) while people gave blood, and she wanted to know if that was service-learning. I said that was service, but that if she had her students research music’s influence on donors, learn what their brain is doing while they’re listening to music, how it affects them, then that would be service-learning. She loved the idea! I think they’ll go to the hospital again, and I think I’ll join her as the English component.”   #### Remember. Live. Dream.   #### “It’s people-learning” "

We are proud of our heritage and excited that the liberal arts model of education continues to be more relevant today than ever before. In today’s world of rapid social, economic, and technological changes, our students are well informed, highly versatile, and equipped with vital critical thinking skills and long-term training for innovation, entrepreneurship, and leadership.  Our school’s signature strengths are the breadth of disciplines and distinguished faculty that encourage students to discover their passions, view issues and challenges from various perspectives, and apply what they have learned to make a difference in their communities, the state, and the world.   ### Academic programs for today and tomorrow  Our 100+ majors , minors , and certificates are broad and strong, and we’re always adding more to prepare our students for important careers.  Our BA in medical humanities and health studies was among the first of its kind. In a new PhD in American studies, students work with community partners to examine how arts and cultural organizations affect communities. And our BA/JD program helps students earn a School of Liberal Arts degree and a law degree in six years instead of seven.   ### Research and projects that tackle big problems  Our faculty are sought-after experts who advance thought on critical topics—from humanitarian crises to climate change—and create projects that help local communities. We’re also home to rare resources, like the Center for Ray Bradbury Studies and a collection of the works of Frederick Douglass .  [Center for Ray Bradbury Studies](http://bradbury.iupui.edu/)  [collection of the works of Frederick Douglass](http://frederickdouglasspapersproject.com/)   ### #LiberalArtsWorks: An education for a lifetime  My liberal arts degree positioned me significantly well to negotiate the job market, but also to see myself as a three-dimensional person, to see those I interact with as complex individuals with rich experiences, and to deeply value community and civic engagement.   ### Alumni who are shaping our city, state, and world  Our alumni have led cities and businesses and nonprofits, helped try war criminals, performed for packed houses, communicated for Fortune 500 companies, engineered better engines, shaped education policy, and saved patients’ lives.

It’s possible when you support the IU School of Liberal Arts through your IRA.   ### A Special Opportunity for Those 70½ Years Old and Older  If you are 70½ years of age or older and have a traditional individual retirement account (IRA), you can make an immediate impact at the IU School of Liberal Arts through an IRA Charitable Rollover Gift, which may provide a tax benefit that lowers your adjusted gross income. With recent changes to the tax laws regarding traditional IRAs, owners of these accounts can make qualified charitable distributions of up to $100,000 in the calendar year.  An IRA Charitable Rollover allows you to:  For your gift to qualify:   ### For those 59½ years old or older  If you’re at least 59½ years old, you can take a distribution and then make a gift from your IRA without penalty. If you itemize your deductions, you can take a charitable deduction for the amount of your gift.   ### At any age  No matter your age, you can designate Indiana University as the beneficiary of all or a percentage of your IRA and it will pass to us tax-free after your lifetime. It’s simple, contact your IRA administrator for a change-of-beneficiary form or download a form from your provider’s website.   ### We’re here to help  It’s important to let us know of your gift because many popular retirement plan administrators assume no obligation to notify a charity of your designation. The administrator also will not monitor whether your gift designations are followed.  We would love to talk to you about how to set up a rollover gift from your retirement assets, answer any questions, and thank you for your generosity. Please contact Liz Goodfellow at lgoodfel@iupui.edu or 317-274-1496.  Information contained herein was accurate at the time of posting. It is not intended as legal or tax advice.

His road there started when he was a School of Liberal Arts student researching and writing about geopolitical issues and international security. Before graduating, he published pieces on geostrategy in Asia and the Taliban in Afghanistan and Pakistan in academic journals.  Here, Shehzad learned aspects of research that he uses every day, from mentors like Professor Emeritus Richard Ward. “He encouraged me to ask penetrating questions,” Shehzad says. “He fostered my critical thinking skills, teaching me the value of challenging dominant narratives. My work today is all about questioning the consensus, a skill I learned from him.”   ### Our undergraduate and graduate students have worked on projects like:   ### Scholarships for student researchers  Some School of Liberal Arts scholarships provide funding opportunities related to research.  For example, undergraduates in the Olaniyan Scholars Program work with faculty mentors on research involving African American and African diaspora studies.

    "body": "  ## SLA FACULTY ANNUAL REVIEW GUIDELINES  IUPUI, including the School of Liberal Arts, has a mandated annual review policy for all faculty (IUPUI Faculty Guide, 2016, p. 70). It is the responsibility of SLA Department Chairs and all SLA faculty (including chairs and faculty in school administrative appointments) to complete the FACULTY ANNUAL REVIEW FORM by the deadline established each year by the Office of the Dean.  The annual review of SLA faculty members serves multiple purposes, as designated by IU, IUPUI, and School policies and guidelines.  These purposes include:  There are several parts to the annual review, including:  The annual review of each faculty member is to be conducted in a timely fashion in accord with departmental bylaws/guidelines and following the schedule established annually by the Dean. At a minimum, the annual review will be based primarily but not exclusively on the faculty member’s ANNUAL REPORT for the calendar year immediately preceding. Additional information for an annual review may be supplied by faculty or requested by a chair, appropriate persons in a department, or the Dean. Although the FACULTY ANNUAL REPORT covers the previous calendar year, the annual review may reflect current spring semester activities and note activity in prior years that is relevant to current review.  Tenure-line faculty, by definition, have research expectations as part of their appointment.  As indicated in the School Faculty Work Document, “faculty are expected to engage in research/creative activity that leads to publication or some other substantive peer- or otherwise appropriately reviewed product/activity/grant within a meaningful period of time.” In order to receive a course release each year, tenure-line faculty must show they have an active scholarly agenda (as described in the Faculty Work Document).  Because active scholars do not necessarily have peer-reviewed products every year, chairs are expected to evaluate scholarly activity over the past few years when making their recommendation for a course release for research/creative activity.  The chair’s brief written assessment should be based on the substance of the FACULTY ANNUAL REPORT and any additional information, as noted above. Written assessments by chairs or other parties must be provided to faculty prior to being forwarded with this form to the Dean (as noted above). Departments are strongly encouraged to include a peer-review component to the annual review process.   ### ANNUAL SUMMARY REVIEW FORM  The Annual Review Form summarizes the evaluation of the teaching, research (or other creative work), and service of faculty members according to the guidelines below. This form must be completed for every faculty member, including for the chair by a departmentally approved review committee . It should be completed by either the chair (or some other appropriately designated body within the faculty member’s department) and the faculty member, and signed by both. In the event of joint appointments, an ANNUAL REVIEW FORM should be completed following the terms outlined in the Memorandum of Understanding that outlines the terms of the joint appointment.  Each faculty member’s work for the preceding year in each of the areas of research, teaching, and service should be reviewed on the following scale using criteria approved by the department:  As noted in the School Faculty Work Document (p. 2), the standard distribution of academic effort for tenure-line faculty is forty percent (40%) research, forty percent (40%) teaching, and twenty percent (20%) service. This distribution may have some variability depending on the focus of scholarship (research, teaching, and/or service) and disciplinary expectations, or as a result of administrative or other appointments. The standard distribution of academic effort for lecturer-line faculty is eighty percent (80%) teaching and twenty percent (20%) service. The distribution of academic effort for faculty in other appointments (e.g., clinical, research specialists) is dependent on the specific appointment and is determined at the time of (re)appointment.  Each department is expected to have clearly articulated criteria for evaluating faculty work as meeting, exceeding, or significantly exceeding department expectations in each of the three areas of teaching, research, and service that are in keeping with the expectations given in the School Faculty Work Document. Using the standard distribution of academic effort for tenure-line faculty as an example, a faculty member who exceeds departmental criteria in teaching (2), significantly exceeds departmental criteria in research (3), and meets departmental criteria in service (1) would receive a Total Evaluation Score of 2.2 [= (2 x 0.4 = 0.8) + (3 x 0.4 = 1.2) + (1 x 0.2 = 0.2)].   ### EVALUATION OF OVERALL SATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE  As indicated in the campus policy on Faculty/Librarian Review and Enhancement (IUPUI Faculty Handbook), one of the purposes of the annual review is to identify and inform faculty whose performance is “substandard” with regard to departmental and school expectations. The Faculty Work Document, adopted by the School Faculty Assembly describes what the school expectations are for each of the three areas of faculty work, which are copied below. Overall satisfactory performance assumes faculty performance in each of these areas, as appropriate, meets or exceeds department and school expectations .  Unsatisfactory Performance  Faculty performance should only be evaluated as overall “unsatisfactory” when there is a clear and documented record of an inability or unwillingness to perform fundamental duties and/or by an absence of intellectual growth and productivity. Determination of overall unsatisfactory performance should involve consideration of faculty activity in all the areas expected for their appointments; however, in the absence of mitigating circumstances , performance that does not meet expectations in one or more areas of work (teaching, research or service) typically indicates overall unsatisfactory performance.  Where the performance of a tenured faculty member in a given area is in danger of falling below the level of acceptability, the department should take early action to rectify the problem whenever possible. In some instances, the faculty member's responsibilities may be adjusted to take account of the situation, as long as adjustments are in keeping with the expectations outlined in the School Faculty Work Document and approved by the Dean. In all cases, the resources of the University for improving the performance of the individual should be made fully available to that faculty member.  As stated in the IUPUI Faculty/Librarian Review and Enhancement Policy, the School Bylaws, and the School Enhancement Review Guidelines, faculty who receive overall evaluations of “unsatisfactory” in two successive years are to be reviewed by the elected School Enhancement Review Committee.  School Expectations for Overall Satisfactory Performance  The Faculty Work Document, approved by the School Faculty Assembly, defines school expectations for performance in each area of faculty work:  Teaching Expectations (pp. 4) “For all faculty members, teaching assignments must balance the school’s need for undergraduate and graduate teaching, and give preference to coverage of courses required for majors as well as courses that meet campus general education core and school competency requirements. At times during a faculty member’s career, these needs may require adjustments in the combination of courses he or she teaches (e.g., with respect to topic, level, frequency of particular offerings, etc.)….  Chairs and directors, in consultation with the Associate Dean for Academic Programs and subject to the approval of the Dean, have the responsibility for creating course schedules, based on curricular requirements and student needs, as well as the authority to assign faculty to teach them, including when (terms, days, times) as well as mode (face-to-face, online, etc.). …  All faculty with teaching assignments are expected to: hold regular office hours (in person or virtually, as appropriate); respond in a timely manner to students; keep current in their fields and with teaching pedagogy; develop syllabi and course requirements that meet department, school, and campus requirements; assess student learning/performance, provide students with regular feedback on their learning/performance, and submit grades and other assessments by posted due dates; and administer and reflect on student course evaluations.  When teaching is part of the faculty assignment, effectiveness is an essential criterion for evaluation and advancement. Faculty must demonstrate command of their subject matter, continuous growth in the subject field, and an ability to create and maintain instructional environments to promote student learning. …  All faculty, regardless of appointment or rank, are required to administer student evaluations in every section of every class that is part of their teaching load in every term, including summer sessions.”  Research Expectations (tenure-line faculty) (pp. 7-8)“By definition, tenure-line faculty members have a responsibility, regardless of rank, to pursue and maintain active research and/or creative activity agendas that (a) lead to the regular dissemination of peer- reviewed publications/products/activities/exhibits in venues (including print, digital, or visual) appropriate for their research/creative activity, and (b) over time lead to or maintain national and/or international recognition of their scholarship. …  It is neither practicable nor appropriate to impose a strict formula to apply these criteria in judging individual faculty research for purposes of a course release. However, examples of scholarly activity that may warrant a course release might include several journal articles and/or book chapters within the previous five years, a refereed book within the previous five to seven years, or the equivalent level of appropriately reviewed products/activity – including public and applied – disseminated in outlets of appropriate quality.”  Service Expectations (tenure-line faculty) (p. 9)“There are no full-time faculty appointments in the School of Liberal Arts that are exempt from service responsibilities. All full-time faculty have basic service obligations to their departments/programs, the school, and the campus. …  At the department/program level, all faculty are expected to attend regularly and participate in department/program meetings, serve on primary and annual review committees as assigned, and contribute to and provide leadership for other committees (e.g., graduate admissions, curriculum, awards) as appropriate. At the school/campus level, all faculty are expected to attend regularly the Faculty Assembly, serve regularly on committees (if and as appropriate for their rank/appointment), periodically hold leadership roles (e.g., chair) on school and/or campus committees, and attend at least one school/campus-level event each year: Commencement, the Celebration of Scholarship, the Graduating Student Reception, the Chancellor’s Honors Convocation and/or the Taylor Symposium. Chairs should encourage and take note of service performed and functions attended.” "

ICR return is also used to incentivize faculty towards grant or contract writing and to reward those who are successful in bringing external dollars into the school.  Policy Statement  ICR Distribution - The cost of conducting research and creative activity includes the direct cost of the proposed project/creative activity as well as the physical and administrative infrastructure required to support those activities. In the context of external funding, most grants include indirect costs (also referred to as facilities and administrative costs [F&A] or indirect cost recovery [ICR]) in order to offset the full costs of conducting research and creative activity. See the following website for additional information and guidance about indirect costs: IU F&A Rates . For each contract or grant that includes indirect costs, 10% of the ICR funds returned to the school will be distributed to a sub-account for use by the principal investigator. Research centers or institutes that support their staff and operating expenses and some independent infrastructure such as financial or grant administration will receive 45% of the ICR returned to the school from campus. Salary Savings – Salary savings occur when a portion of a faculty member's general fund (12 account) budgeted salary and benefits are charged to a sponsored program account. This occurs often, but not exclusively, in the context of buyout of teaching time during the ten-month appointment. For external grants where faculty buy out 10% or more of their salary and benefits, the School of Liberal Arts will distribute 20% of the salary savings to the principal investigator’s sub-account to support their research and creative activity and 30% to the PI’s home department/unit to support the research or creative activity of their faculty. Salary savings will be returned as outlined above based on the salary savings portion only (not benefits) minus instructional replacement costs.

    "body": "  # Arab Indianapolis Community History Project  Edward E. Curtis IV  March, 2023  Edward E. Curtis IV   ### Current Situation  Nativism and xenophobia are potent social and political forces in the United States. Anti-immigrant discrimination often spills over into violence against anyone perceived to be different, dark, or dangerous. It extends to U.S.-born Black and brown people, non-English speakers, women who wear hijabs, and others.  Lazy versions of U.S. history aid and abet such hatred. The stereotype of Indiana as exclusively white and Christian erases the religious, racial, and ethnic diversity of our state and our city. This project aims to narrate a more accurate chronicle of our shared past by unearthing the long, forgotten history of Arabs in Indianapolis, reclaiming their stake in building this city, and creating new collective memories of who we have been.   ### The Project  The Arab Indianapolis project explores and celebrates the history of Arab Americans in Greater Indianapolis, the diversity of our community, and our contributions to the city. We connect contemporary Hoosiers of all backgrounds to our shared past.  The project began in March, 2020. Two dozen other Arab Americans and nine student researchers assisted in its development. IU Indianapolis students Jay Brodzeller and Ronnie Kawak worked on the project from beginning to end; Dana Dobbins, Emma Eldridge, Lily Malcomb, Layla Mitiche, Asrar Jaber, Jamee West, and Mickey Yoder made significant contributions, as well. Ziad Hefni was the project’s photographer. Prof. Paul Mullins and Prof. Jeff Wilson also supported the project. It has been supported by 75 individual donors and 14 institutions .  [75 individual donors and 14 institutions](https://arabindianapolis.com/donations/)   ### Humanitarian Impact  The immediate impacts of the project can be seen in terms of its public prominence and the number of people who have engaged one of its products. As of now, there have been over 28,000 views of the blog, over 1,100 views of the Arab Indianapolis Heritage Trail on Clio, and hundreds of books sold or given away. The film has been broadcast on all eight PBS stations in Indiana and is steaming on PBS. It was also selected for inclusion in the Heartland Film Festival. The project and its director have received broad media coverage in the Indianapolis Star , Indianapolis Monthly , WISH-TV , WFYI News , WRTV , IU Research , and WFYI’s member magazine and website . The future impact of the historical marker at Lucas Oil Stadium, the use of the PBS Learning Media lesson plans, the 20 Indiana Humanities-sponsored screenings and dialogues, and the paid educator workshops will multiply and extend the influence of Arab Indianapolis in communities and classrooms across Indiana and beyond. In the Arab American community itself, the project has been shared countless times on social media, and long-lost friends have contacted one another to reconnect as a result of the project. It has spurred pride, learning, and self-examination in the Arab community, as reflected in Sierra Martin’s interview in the Indianapolis Star and Sara Hindi’s review of the book .

    "body": "  # Exploring Patient Perspectives on a Novel Reproductive Grief Screening Tool  Jennifer J. Bute and Maria Brann  February, 2023  Jennifer J. Bute and Maria Brann   ### Current Situation  Millions of families in the U.S. have experienced the heartbreak of reproductive loss. Some losses occur quite early in a pregnancy, and others are the result of stillbirth or unbearable decisions surrounding termination. While such losses are incredibly common, our health care system does little to acknowledge the grief that accompanies such loss and often fails to provide much-needed support and coping resources for patients and their families.   ### The Project  Our research explores a vital tool for supporting women grieving reproductive loss: a novel reproductive grief screening tool that health care practitioners can use to monitor women who would benefit from additional assistance and resources to help them manage their grief. Similar to existing tools to screen for postpartum depression, this new screening tool could be used by clinicians in a variety of contexts, including in OB/GYN offices, family practice clinics, and mental health care settings.  The current project we’re conducting centers on sharing the screening tool with women who have experienced reproductive loss to get their feedback on potential use of that tool, including their ideas on how the tool should be administered and discussed, as well as any concerns women have about the screening process.   ### Humanitarian Impact  Reproductive loss takes a well-documented toll on women’s mental health, and the effects of such loss(es) can persist for years. We aim to improve women’s lives through development of a set of best practices for administering and using the screening tool so that women can access the help and support they need.   ### Results / Data  Drs. Bute and Brann will present preliminary results of this work at the Institute of Reproductive Grief Care’s inaugural symposium: “Transforming Reproductive Grief Care” in March 2023.   ### Featured Media   ### Research Team   #### Project Leads  Dr. Jennifer Bute , Professor, Communication Studies  [Dr. Jennifer Bute](https://liberalarts.iupui.edu/programs/wgss/directory/jennifer-bute/)  Dr. Maria Brann , Professor, Communication Studies  [Dr. Maria Brann](https://liberalarts.iupui.edu/departments/communication-studies/directory/maria-brann/)  Drs.

    "body": " Major Performance Review and Reappointment of Professors of Practice  I. Description of Responsibilities Professors of Practice are appointees who have achieved distinction in their fields of practice. They bring unique practical experiences and talents that will benefit students and strengthen the reputation of the School. The main responsibility of Professors of Practice is teaching, although they may be assigned research, creative and service responsibilities associated with their contributions to student development and placement. See I U Policy ACA-19: Regulation of Professor of Practice Appointments .  [I U Policy ACA-19: Regulation of Professor of Practice Appointments](http://policies.iu.edu/policies/categories/academic-faculty-students/academic-appointment-review/Regulation-of-professors-practice.shtml)  II. Major Performance Review and Reappointment Professors of Practice are initially appointed for three years. Assuming a successful substantive mid-term departmental review, their contracts are then renewed annually through their seventh year in rank at IU. A major performance review will take place before the end of the seven-year probationary period, and if performance is judged excellent, appointees shall be given long-term renewable contracts of either three year or five-year terms. Professors of Practice should be reviewed within the scope of their appointment letter.  C riteria for Major Performance Review and Reappointment  1. Teaching All Professors of Practice seeking reappointment based on a major performance review are evaluated on teaching. •     A four-option continuum is used to rate candidate performance in teaching: Excellent, Very Good, Effective and Ineffective. •     Excellence in teaching must be demonstrated at the local—unit and School—level.  E x cellence in teaching may include– but is not limited to –the following: 1.1 A record of high quality teaching demonstrated by sustained excellence in classroom performance, including the presentation and discussion of student evaluations for all courses. (required) 1.2 Evidence of peer observation and evaluation of teaching. (required) 1.3 A trajectory of improved teaching skills as shown by various measures of teaching, including student evaluations. (required) 1.4 Keeping course content and mentoring up to date, in terms of new developments in their field of expertise. (required) 1.5 Evidence of successful teaching across the undergraduate curriculum within an area of expertise and, when applicable, in different teaching environments (large and small class sizes). (required) 1.6 Student involvement in the Professor of Practice’s ongoing creative practice and management activity, as apprentices, assistants, interns, or advisees. 1.7 Unsolicited letters from students in addition to those solicited by the unit or school. 1.8 Undergraduate and graduate student advising/mentoring activities. 1.9 Teaching awards and other similar recognition of pedagogical excellence. 1.10 Participation in course and curriculum development and innovation. 1.11 Evidence of leadership/participation in the School of Liberal Art’s instructional goals and objectives 1.12 Development of new teaching materials such as textbooks, cases, instructor manuals, student guides, websites, and videos. 1.13 Participation in teaching and learning activities within the School, IUPUI, IU or peer professional groups. [For examples, see IU’s Mosaic Active Learning Initiative, http://ctl.iupui.edu/Programs/Mosaic-Faculty-Fellows-Program and the Faculty Academy on Excellence in Teaching, https://facet.iu.edu/index.html.] 1.14 Published peer-reviewed, non-peer-reviewed, and invited articles related to teaching. 1.15 Presentations at local, statewide or national/international conferences about teaching. 1.16 Supervision of independent study students.  [http://ctl.iupui.edu/Programs/Mosaic-Faculty-Fellows-Program](http://ctl.iupui.edu/Programs/Mosaic-Faculty-Fellows-Program)  2. Service All Professors of Practice are expected to make service contributions, although the extent and nature of these contributions may vary based on initial expectations set forward in each contract of employment. •     A four-option continuum is used to rate candidate performance in service: Excellent, Very Good, Satisfactory and Unsatisfactory. •    Professors of Practice up for reappointment are expected to be at least Satisfactory in service.  Satisfactory service contributions may include— but is not limited to —the following: 2.1 Participation in service activities that support teaching/learning. 2.2Membership on graduate student MA committees. 2.3 Supervision and mentorship of TAs with significant instructional responsibilities. 2.4 Involvement in student groups/clubs that support student learning and professional development. 2.5 Development of service-learning components to the School’s curriculum. 2.6 Internal or external service awards and grants. 2.7 Participation or leadership in unit, School, and campus committees. 2.8 Participation in School and IUPUI activities in support of the teaching mission (e.g., attending commencement, supporting activities related to student scholarship and professional development). 2.9 Development of educational programs, workshops, and other training ventures for School constituencies. 2.10 Public service to the community that calls upon professional expertise as a teacher, pedagogical scholar, or practitioner. 2.11 Leadership in service activities of professional organizations. 2.12 Serving as liaison with industry to develop or maintain industry internships, guest lectures and other activities and events that either bring industry to campus or give our students opportunities in the industry at large.  3. Creative practice and management activity Professors of Practice may be expected to continue their work as creative artists and practitioners in their chosen fields of practice or to contribute to the management of industry processes. The extent and nature of these contributions will vary based on initial expectations set forward in each contract of employment. •     A four-option continuum is used to evaluate those evaluated on this dimension of activity: Excellent, Very Good, Satisfactory and Unsatisfactory. •     Professors of Practice who are expected to contribute in creative, professional or management activities are expected to be at least Satisfactory in this endeavor when they go up for a major performance review and reappointment.  C reative and professional activities and management contributions may include – but are not limited to – the following: 3.1 Participate in the creative process (e.g., produce, write, direct, perform, stage, shoot, score, edit) with local, regional, national or international groups or outlets. 3.2 Participate in the distribution of creative work with local, regional, national or international groups or outlets. 3.3 Serve as a management consultant in the creative development process or distribution of creative work. 3.4 Collaborate with practitioners or industry leaders in innovative projects. 3.5 Create, organize or head an entity that shepherds the creative process or distributes creative work. 3.6 Publish invited or peer-reviewed papers or participate in presentations about creative works, new techniques or other advances in their fields.  III. Timing No later than the sixth year as a Professor of Practice, a faculty member will undergo a major performance review in order to receive a long-term contract. Shortened probationary periods may be the result of demonstrated teaching excellence that predates appointment in the School or an exceptional record of teaching, service or creative accomplishments in the School.  Evaluation of a candidate for a long-term Professor of Practice position within the School results in an up or out decision: Faculty either receive a longer-term contract, or they will not be permitted to teach full- time in the School beyond the term of their contract.  Reappointment decisions are made at least one full year in advance (i.e., the decision to renew a contract for a Professor Practice’s fourth year is made during the Professor of Practice’s second year of work). Professor of Practice therefore are guaranteed a full year of employment following a negative performance evaluation (i.e., faculty have voted against reappointment).  The following structure and activities are designed to support a newly hired Professor of Practice: 1. First year 1.1 Orientation to expectations through first semester meetings with unit chair. 1.2 The unit chair serves as official mentor for the first year. 1.3 Annual review completed no later than the end of the second semester of employment. 1.4 In-person meeting with the unit chair to discuss the annual review.  2. Second year 2.1 Annual review completed no later than the end of the spring semester, typically the fourth semester of employment. 2.2 Reappointment decision for the fourth year is made during the spring semester.  3. Third year 3.1 Substantive mid-term departmental review. Review completed no later than the end of the spring semester. Professors of Practice are expected to prepare a dossier for this review. In addition to a summary of student and faculty evaluations of teaching, a personal statement on teaching and service contributions at IU must be provided. An effective narrative is likely to include discussion of one’s approach to teaching, specific activities and contributions, an assessment of growth and accomplishments, and goals for the future. 3.2 A positive third year review results in a contract for the fifth year, and allows the candidate to be considered for one-year renewable contracts through their seventh year, subject to annual performance reviews.  4. Fourth and fifth years 4.1 Annual review completed no later than the end of the spring semester. 4.2 In-person meeting with the unit chair to discuss the annual review. 4.3 Reappointment for sixth year is made during spring semester of the fourth year. Reappointment for the seventh year is made during spring semester of the fifth year.  5. Sixth year 5.1 During the fall semester of the sixth year of the appointment, Professors of Practice prepare their major performance review dossiers. In addition to a summary of student and faculty evaluations of teaching, a personal statement on teaching and service contributions at IU must be provided. An effective narrative is likely to include discussion of one’s approach to teaching, specific activities and contributions, an assessment of growth and accomplishments, and goals for the future. [Note: These will not be submitted through the IU edossier.] 5.2 The third week of January is the deadline for submitting their major performance review dossiers to the unit chair. 5.3 Units have until the end of March to review dossiers, vote, and prepare written assessments of candidates to the School dean.  Deadlines established for the school third-year review process should be followed. The criteria outlined above should be used for making the evaluations and recommendations for reappointment or not. 5.4 The School Promotion & Tenure Committee reviews, votes, and prepares an evaluative report on candidates, following deadlines established for the school third-year review process, and using the criteria outlined above for making their evaluation. This evaluation and recommendation for reappointment or not is forwarded to the Dean by no later than the third Monday of April. 5.5 The Dean will make the final decision with regard to reappointment to a long-term contract.

Lamb wrote the article in conjunction with an on-campus roundtable discussion he organized in March 2015 about the increase in injuries among teenaged athletes.  [Chris Lamb](https://liberalarts.iupui.edu/about/directory/lamb-chris.html)  [“Epidemic of injuries hits young athletes”](http://www.indystar.com/story/opinion/2015/03/09/epidemic-injuries-hits-young-athletes/24650949/)  [on-campus roundtable discussion](http://news.iupui.edu/releases/2015/02/youth-baseball-injuries.shtml)  According to the AAOS, the MORE Awards honor media efforts that further public understanding of musculoskeletal health-related issues and encourage healthy behaviors in the care of bones, joints, muscles and tendons.  Lamb will be honored at an awards ceremony in Washington, D.C., in May.  “I’m thrilled that my column was recognized by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons,” Lamb said. “When I became a journalism professor, I didn’t want to quit being a journalist. So this award obviously means a lot to me.”  The column can be viewed on the Indianapolis Star website .

He is the author or editor of eight books, including From Jack Johnson to LeBron James: Sports, Media, and the Color Line , which was published in early January.

    "body": "  ## Helping Students in Distress: A Guide for IUPUI Faculty and Staff  Many college students experience challenges related to academics, family, friendships, work, finances, loneliness, homesickness and mental and physical illness. A majority of the time they are able to successfully manage the challenges and demands of college life, but for some students these challenges become overwhelming and unmanageable on their own.  Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) is committed to promoting the well-being and safety of its community members and the integrity of its learning environment. Faculty and staff members have a unique role in that they may witness or become aware of a student in distress in the classroom, in your office or in their workplace on campus. Students may also seek out assistance from faculty and staff members in lieu of speaking to a family member or friend when they perceive you as available and willing to listen. The expression of concern and support a faculty or staff member may provide to a student could make a critical difference in not only their academic career but also their personal life.  Some Indicators that a Student May Be in Distress  What You Can Do to Help a Student in Distress  The ways in which you respond to a student in distress will vary by your personal style, skills, experience, and beliefs. Some students may be more open to assistance than others. Factors such as setting, class size, and the depth of your relationship with the student also may have a substantial affect on your interaction. It is important to be realistic about what you can do. Do not attempt to be the counselor, but do provide information and referral options regarding available university and community resources.  Here are some guidelines and tips for interacting with the student:  Students in Crisis  A crisis is a situation in which an individual’s usual style of coping is no longer effective, and the emotional or physiological response begins to escalate to a point where the person may become disoriented, non-functional or attempt harm. Crisis can be a result of an emotionally stressful event or a traumatic change in one’s life. If a student is in a serious mental health crisis you may see the following symptoms (in addition to the symptoms of distress):  What Should I Do if a Student is in Crisis and Immediate Attention is Needed?  If you believe that a student may pose a threat of imminent danger of harm to him/herself or to others, call the IUPUI Police immediately by dialing 911 or 274-7911.  If the situation is not an emergency and there is no imminent threat, then consider the following:  Confidentiality  Due to ethical and legal parameters of confidentiality, Counseling and Psychological Services is unable to discuss or provide any information about a student counseling session without a student’s written permission or in accordance with law. If a faculty or staff member is interested in knowing whether a student has visited or made contact with CAPS, consider following up with the student yourself and asking him/her about the appointment.  Additional information can be found on the CAPS website at http://life.iupui.edu/caps/ and specifically in the document “Helping Students in Distress: Responses and Resources for the IUPUI Community”.

    "body": "  # Political Incivility: Does Name-Calling Work?  Aaron Dusso, Sydnee Perkins  March, 2023  Aaron Dusso, Sydnee Perkins   ### Current Situation  Incivility in politics is nothing new. Indeed, thanks to the hit Broadway musical Hamilton, we all know that Alexander Hamilton (then Secretary of the Treasury) and Aaron Burr (then Vice President of the United States) had a dual that resulted in Hamilton’s death. Fortunately, political incivility does not rise to that extreme very often. But a general dislike and disrespect for one’s political opponents appears to be on the rise. One particular example of this incivility at the elite level is name-calling. Name-calling is a method of disrespecting one’s foes most often associated with the playground, but with Donald Trump’s campaign and election in 2016 the power of name-calling became a common part of elite political discourse. Trump is a practiced name-caller. His labeling of Hillary Clinton as “Crooked” Hillary stuck, while “Sleepy” Joe never had quite the same success. As he runs to re-capture the White House in 2024, he is trying out new names for his primary opponents on a nearly weekly basis. But is name-calling a good political strategy? That is, does it help the candidate who engages in name-calling by reducing the public’s perception of their opponent? Unfortunately, extant research does not provide a clear answer.   ### The Project  In order to determine the effectiveness of name-calling as a political strategy, we have designed and implemented a survey experiment that asks respondent to rate fictitious statements made by political candidates about their opponents. The statements are presented as part of a fictitious AP news story (based on a real AP story from the 2019 Democratic primary campaign). We use fictitious names of candidates (both perpetrators and victims) with the treatment group seeing a statement where the name-calling candidate makes a statement about their primary opponent (the victim) with a pejorative (crooked or heartless) added before the perpetrating candidate uses the name of their opponent. The control group sees the exact same story, but without the name-calling added. Thus, both stories are exactly the same except for one word. We then ask the survey respondents to rate both candidates on a sliding scale from 1 to 100. If name-calling “works,” evaluations of the victim should be lower when the pejorative is used than when it is not.  Ultimately, our survey experiment includes 2016 individuals who were randomly assigned to either the treatment or control groups when reading two different fictitious AP news stories. We contracted with Dynata (an international consumer opinion company) to provide us with survey respondents in the U.S. The survey was designed and implemented using Qualtrics’ survey platform.   ### Results / Data  The results of the project were recently published in the Journal of Elections, Public Opinion and Parties . In sum, name-calling does not work as intended. We found no evidence that evaluations of victims were influenced by the use of a pejorative (crooked or heartless) by their opponent. However, we did find that name-calling can backfire on the perpetrator. In particular, when Democrats engaged in name-calling, both Republican and Democratic identifying respondents rated the name-caller lower than when no pejorative was used. But the same is not true when a Republican candidate engaged in name-calling. While it did not appear to help the candidate (i.e., reduce the rating of victim), neither Republican nor Democratic identifying respondents rated the Republican name-caller lower than when no pejorative was present.  [Journal of Elections, Public Opinion and Parties](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17457289.2023.2168677)  Thus, a word of advice for Democratic candidates: Do not engage in name-calling. It will not help and may hurt.   ### Research Team   #### Project Leads  Dr. Aaron Dusso , Associate Professor and Chair, Department of Political Science Sydnee Perkins, 2020 graduate, Political Science major  [Dr. Aaron Dusso](https://liberalarts.iupui.edu/departments/polisci/directory/aaron-dusso/) "

    "body": "  # Liberal Arts’ Priya Dave named top IUPUI student  Thursday, April 19, 2018  For many people, climbing Mount Kilimanjaro might be the peak accomplishment of their life.  For Priya Dave, that was just winter break.  Dave, a senior medical humanities student in the IU School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI, was named IUPUI’s top student at the 2018 IUPUI Top 100 Outstanding Students Recognition Dinner. She will take her success to the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City where she begins medical school in the fall.  Medicine interested Dave early in life as she watched her younger sister struggle with a chronic illness. Dave remembers attending numerous doctors’ appointments when they were children and watching the illness progress. “Seeing the doctor/ patient relationship in those visits helped confirm the career I wanted,” she says. Her sister is now healthy and studying at IU-Bloomington. It was her idea that she and Priya should climb Mount Kilimanjaro together—a six-day feat they accomplished.  Dave graduated from Center Grove High School and, after being awarded a Bepko Scholarship from the honor’s college, set her sights on IUPUI. “I really liked the urban environment that IUPUI has,” she says. “We have five major hospitals around here so that was a big draw as well. I was a biology major when I started and then took a medical humanities class and really loved it. It was an opportunity to explore something completely different that I wouldn’t have had time to do in medical school.”  Dave says the medical humanities program within the School of Liberal Arts offers the opportunity to explore many fields and pathways that connect to medicine and the liberal arts with classes as diverse as the history of medicine, bioethics, and the sociology of death and dying. “All these various perspectives will prepare me to be a stronger and more empathetic physician,” she says. “This major was a perfect fit for me.”  She credits each course in the program for giving her a unique perspective that she will take with her through grad school and beyond. One such perspective was the theme of blame in Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein.” The book asks if the monster is responsible for his own actions or if Dr. Frankenstein, the creator, should be held accountable. “The concept of blame is very relevant to medicine,” Dave says. “A patient has to deal with what caused a diagnosis.” She will take her research on blame and present it at Stanford University’s Health Humanities Consortium Conference on April 20.  IUPUI has offered Dave a wealth of internship and study abroad opportunities as well. As a Spanish minor, she was able to put her speaking skills to work at the University of Havana, helping the Distributed Drug Discovery Lab teach students about neglected diseases and the need to discover medications to fight them. She’s also traveled to Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, and Panama through IUPUI Study Abroad and Global Medical Brigades, a program that goes to a new Latin American country each year to set up a medical clinic.  Dave also helped revive the medical humanities club and is now the president. She has staged a mock bioethics committee event, helped planned the Midwest Medical Humanities Undergraduate Conference, and visited art museums to discuss how different works relate to the liberal arts.  Along with being the top student at IUPUI, Dave was also the School of Liberal Arts Faculty Medal of Academic Distinction winner and a William M. Plater Civic Engagement Medallion.  “I’ve had so many amazing opportunities to support aspects of the humanities within medicine,” Dave says. “I’m very thankful for the opportunities I’ve had and to be recognized. [IUPUI's top student award] is a reflection of all the incredible opportunities that my mentors at IUPUI afforded me. IUPUI provided the ideal environment to excel in anything and everything I could imagine. I am beyond grateful for my experience at IUPUI, culminating in this honor.\" "

Read full Diversity Strategic Plan 2021-2024   ## Liberal Arts Statement Against Violence from Interim Dean Robert Rebein  In the IU School of Liberal Arts, we denounce racism, hate, and bigotry in all its forms. We especially denounce police brutality because it undermines our belief in a society built on the values of respect and dignity for all people. Read full statement   ## Africana Studies Statement from Acting Director Leslie K. Etienne, PhD  The murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and Dreasjon Reed (here in Indianapolis), are shameful and despicable indicators of a fulcrum of covert and overt anti-Black racism that has successfully enslaved, murdered, raped, beaten, maimed, and discriminated against Black people for hundreds of years. Contemporary socioeconomic obstacles, including housing discrimination, mass incarceration, over-policing and extra-legal surveillance, labor & wage exploitation, health disparities, and environmental injustices also have legacies traceable across centuries. History tells us that the current instances of police brutality, police harassment, and police murder is in no way a new phenomenon, nor is it an anomalous feature of U.S. society. Adding further injury, attempts to resist or to simply acknowledge these issues is typically met with outright hostility or subtle microaggressions that pervade the daily lives of Black people. Under such conditions, suspicion, perceived or imaginary threats, illogical uninformed stereotyping, and rote dishonesty steeped in racist conditioning becomes weaponized and often results in death for Black people – young and old. Responses from the justice system and larger society encapsulate a wide range of obfuscations, gaslighting, and a systematic aversion to engaging the root causes of oppression that activate such a lack of concern for humanity.  The IU School of Liberal Arts Africana Studies Program recognizes that the perspectives and insights we gain through our scholarly work in this discipline makes us uniquely qualified to critically probe the ever-present existence of anti-Blackness. We further assert that our scholarship and teaching must endeavor to expose how white supremacy and systemic racism work to deploy iniquitous formulae that maintain a corrosive residency in Black lives. We see this is as our front of struggle within the larger movement, and as we are called to study the Black Radical and Intellectual Traditions, we understand that we must also stand steadfastly in solidarity with activists, some of whom are students in the Africana Studies Program, currently engaging in protesting state violence against Black men, women, boys and girls. The collective resilience of Black people in protracted struggle serve as a counter to strategies aimed to dampen and discredit dissent, empty platitudes meant to satiate in the short term, and the backlash that always follows even perceived Black success. The Africana Studies Program is committed to supporting and guiding student inquiry that foments a deeper analysis of the Africana context, and encourages critical interrogation of white supremacy toward its end.   ## Spirit & Place Black Lives Matter Statement  [Read full statement](https://spiritandplace.org/)   ### Resources  There are many resources across the University to support an environment in which everyone can succeed and develop academically, professionally, and personally.

He went on to an MPH/PhD program at the University of Southern Florida (USF), earning both degrees in 2019, and has become a tenured line Assistant Professor at California State University-Stanislaus.  Dr. Logan’s anthropology research and love for teaching students allows him to combine those efforts to take on some of our most important social issues in society today.  While completing his MA, he served as a Service-Learning Assistant for the Field Work in an Ethnography course, guiding younger students through their first research experiences. Logan’s PhD thesis at USF focused on the role that community health workers play in Central Indiana in delivering essential services to underserved Latinx communities.  This project continues to bring him back to his home state of Indiana frequently and he doesn’t pass up the opportunity to guest lecture and lend his expertise some very fortunate anthropology students. He loves to share his ongoing research, what’s happening in the field of Medical Anthropology, and career opportunities in the discipline to today’s liberal arts students.  In addition to several peer-reviewed articles, Ryan Logan is anticipating his new publication entitled, Boundaries of Care: Community Health Workers in the United States , which identifies serious challenges community health workers face in the context of the coronavirus pandemic.  The School of Liberal Arts and the Department of Anthropology are proud of alumnus Ryan Logan―a wonderful role model and inspiration to the students from Indiana to California.   ### Distinguished Alumni Award  The Distinguished Alumni Award is the School of Liberal Arts’ highest honor. Ms. Mautrice Meriweather is recognized this year as an alumnus who has displayed an enduring excellence in her field while continuing extraordinary service to Indiana University and IUPUI.  Meriweather is a remarkable professional who has leveraged her liberal arts education to achieve great career success and to serve the Indiana University communities. In her role as Chief Talent Officer, she pulls in interns and serves on career panels for the School and IUPUI.As a life-long learner, she has honed her skillsets to achieve excellence in all her many leadership roles.  Ms. Meriweather served as a member-at-large of the IU School of Liberal Arts Alumni Board, and later was named president. During her two-year term as president, Mautrice led the Board in a collaborative strategic planning process to rethink their purpose and function, with the hopes of creating avenues to support the school through alumni engagement. She set up new committees to activate and engage alumni, and she established onboarding and mentoring practices for new members.  During Ms. Meriweather’s presidency, she led an effort to refresh bylaws to allow for a more diverse and active board. Board members are now developing a more meaningful connection to the academic mission of the school through specific programming and events targeted at helping students succeed and prepare for an array of career possibilities. Mautrice chaired the intern and public outreach committee on which she worked tirelessly with the School’s Director of Career Services to lay the groundwork for what is now the Career Communities class and alumni panel.  When her term as board president ended, Meriweather was elected to the IU Alumni Association executive council, where she plays a pivotal role in reshaping the overall governance process and strategic approach to alumni engagement.  In these two extraordinary roles, Mautrice Meriweather has put her mark on establishing new visions for the exceptional alumni base of Indiana University and the School of Liberal Arts congratulates her achievements.   ### Maynard K. Hine Award  The IU School of Liberal Arts is excited to congratulate Dr. Tiffany S. Kyser, an IU School of Liberal Arts English Master’s Graduate of 2010, was awarded the Maynard K. Hine Award. The Hine Award, given annually since 1974, was named for the first chancellor of the IUPUI campus, and it recognizes alumni and volunteer leaders for their contributions in support of the campus and its alumni programs.  Dr. Kyser is an educator with more than 18 years’ experience across the entire spectrum of education—from K–12 teaching to higher education administration. Her work has been rooted in educational policy, adult learning, and change management. She has received numerous awards and accolades, including Indy’s Best and Brightest Award for education and nonprofit, NCAA Indiana Woman of the Year, Ebony magazine’s Power 100, Indiana Business Journal’s Forty Under 40, and appointed to the Stanley K. Lacy Executive Leadership Series, Class XLIII. In recognition of her illustrious four-year basketball career at IUPUI—where she finished as one of the top players in the women’s basketball program’s history—her jersey, No. 44, was retired in 2004, and she was inducted into IUPUI Athletics Hall of Fame in 2008.  Kyser currently serves as associate director for engagement and partnerships at the Midwest and Plains Equity Assistance Center within the Great Lakes Equity Center. She has served on numerous boards and committees, including the IUPUI School of Education Alumni Advisory Council, IU Health’s Virtual Care Patient & Family Advisory Council, the IUPUI Alumni Council, and the IUPUI School of Liberal Arts Alumni Board.  Dr. Ryan Logan, Ms. Mautrice Meriweather, and Dr. Tiffany Kyser are all shining examples of the power of a liberal arts education. The Indiana University School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI, the IU Alumni Association, and the entire IUPUI community congratulates them looks forward to following their bright futures. "

    "body": "  ## Promotion Policy and Procedures for Associate Faculty  Promotion to the rank of senior associate faculty is recognition of excellence in teaching in the School of Liberal Arts and a sign of confidence in future high-quality instruction. A candidate for promotion from associate faculty to senior associate faculty is required to show evidence of teaching excellence, including influence on student outcomes and accessibility to students. Convincing evidence will document instruction that has been of high quality and has made important contributions to student learning, using criteria established by the home department or program.  Eligibility Associate faculty who have taught at least 18 credit hours and for at least four semesters in the School of Liberal Arts are eligible to submit a portfolio for review for promotion.  Benefits Senior associate faculty will receive the following benefits:  NOTE: Per campus policy, the ability of associate faculty to be considered for promotion does not constitute tenure or the right to continuous contracts. Promoted associate faculty members will continue to be considered for future employment based on alignment of their skills with school needs.  Promotion Materials Candidates for promotion to the rank of Senior Associate Faculty will provide their department with evidence of teaching excellence. Departments have flexibility as to what materials will be provided, but it’s recommended that the materials include such things as student evaluations, peer evaluations, evidence of curriculum development, and evidence of impact on learning.  Review Process Once associate faculty are eligible for promotion, they may submit their promotion portfolios to the department chair or program director before the end of January. The chair or director will appoint a promotion review committee of at least three members, one member of which may hold the rank of senior associate faculty. The promotion review committee will evaluate the portfolio and make its recommendation for promotion to the chair or director. The chair or director will write his or her recommendation and send it, along with the promotion committee’s recommendation, to the dean for his or her review and decision. If promotion is approved, promotion takes effect the ensuing fall semester.  Appendix 1  The IU Academic Handbook indicates the following with regard to promotion based on excellence in teaching:  Teaching. The prime requisites of any effective teacher are intellectual competence, integrity, independence, a willingness to consider suggestions and to cooperate in teaching activities, a spirit of scholarly inquiry which leads the teacher to develop and strengthen course content in the light of developments in the field as well as to improve methods of presenting material, a vital interest in teaching and working with students, and, above all, the ability to stimulate their intellectual interest and enthusiasm. The quality of teaching is admittedly difficult to evaluate. This evaluation is so important, however, that recommendations for an individual’s promotion should include evidence drawn from such sources as the collective judgment of students, of student counselors, and of colleagues who have visited other classes or who have been closely associated with his or her teaching as supervisor or in some other capacity, or who have taught the same students in subsequent courses.  [NOTE: This policy will take effect August 2015. Starting that term, all associate faculty, regardless of degree, will be paid at the current PhD rate. Future promotion increases will be based on that rate once candidates have gone through the promotion process.]  Approved by the School of Liberal Arts Faculty Assembly: April 18, 2014 "

    "body": "  ## Individualized Major Program  The Individualized Major Program (IMP) in the School of Liberal Arts is designed to meet the needs of disciplined and self-motivated students who may wish to major and earn a Bachelor of Arts degree in traditional Liberal Arts disciplines or interdisciplinary areas for which majors are not available at IUPUI. The IMP also serves transfer students who wish to continue course studies started elsewhere in areas in which IUPUI has faculty expertise but no organized majors.   ### Find your purpose through your own customized major  If you have a special interest in pursuing in-depth study of a combination of disciplines across the curriculum, then a personally designed, individualized major may be the opportunity you’re looking for.  Pursuing an individualized major will allow you to pull from your different areas of interests and combine them into one cohesive plan of study. It reflects who you are as an individual. You will work alongside an advisor and faculty members to plan and design your field of study - think of it as your own personalized career path.   ### How does it work?  The IMP works like any other field of study at IUPUI. You will attend classes, complete all other IUPUI core requirements, and regularly meet with your advisor to make sure you are staying on the path to success. You will also work closely with faculty advisors and your custom-designed major will be overseen and approved by a faculty committee to ensure intellectual integrity and diligence.   ### Admission and Academic Progress  All students seeking admission must:  Under the supervision of a primary faculty advisor, students will prepare a proposal for an individualized major. Students are accepted for admission to the major when their proposal is approved by the advisor and their faculty committee.  After admission to the program, students must meet each semester with their primary IMP advisor to consider their academic progress and register for courses.   ### Courses  The Individualized Major requires a minimum of 34 credit hours in the major. Two courses are required of all students (4 to 7 credit hours): SLA I360 Individualized Major Plan (1 credit hour) A tutorial in which a student develops his or her plan for a major, including a list of courses, schedule, and rationale. Students proposing majors in traditional fields should discuss the history and nature of the discipline, describe its subfields and the methodologies it employs and shows how the proposed major fits within this framework. Those designing unique majors need to establish the intellectual unity of the proposed major and show appreciation of the different disciplinary traditions and methodologies on which it will draw. SLA I460 Individualized Major Senior Project (3 to 6 credit hours) A tutorial devoted to a capstone project that culminates and integrates the individualized major. Normally this is a major research paper with an oral presentation, but other options may also be approved if appropriate for a particular plan of study. Typically, the project is presented to the student’s Individualized Major Committee and should also be presented to a broader audience in a seminar, colloquium or student conference.  The remaining courses are selected from existing courses. (30 or more credit hours)   ### Scholarships and Awards  As an individualized major student, you have access to several awards and scholarships that will provide financial support as you pursue your career.   #### Muhammad Shafi Memorial Scholarship  Founded in honor and memory of Muhammad Safi who was a firm believer in the Islamic faith, students pursuing an individualized major in Arabic and Islamic studies may apply for this $500 scholarship. For specific requirements and how to apply, go to Muhammad Shafi Memorial Scholarship .  [Muhammad Shafi Memorial Scholarship](https://liberalarts.iupui.edu/admissions/scholarships/Muhammad-Shafi-Mem-Scholarship.html)  You may also be eligible for school and campus scholarships and awards. Awards are given annually each spring, and several can be applied to and received more than once. See the School of Liberal Arts Scholarships and Awards for more information.  [School of Liberal Arts Scholarships and Awards](https://liberalarts.iupui.edu/admissions/scholarships/index.html)   ### How Do I Get Started?  If you are considering your own individualized major, either as a new student or as a transfer student, please contact Dr. Ray Haberski , Associate Dean for Academic Programs and Director for Individualized Majors.

    "body": "  ## Policy on Faculty Work  According to the IU Academic Handbook: “The academic work of Indiana University is done by individuals holding academic appointments in different classifications. Each tenured and tenure-probationary faculty member has responsibilities in the areas of teaching, research and service… Academic appointees in other classifications have responsibilities in some but not all of the three areas” (p. 63). The IU Academic Handbook and the IUPUI Supplement to the Handbook provide details on faculty ranks, rights, privileges, and obligations.  All academic appointees are required to fully meet the professional obligations of their appointments. Full-time academic appointees are expected to devote their primary professional time and energy to carrying out teaching, research and service responsibilities on behalf of Indiana University. The distribution of faculty effort depends both on the type of academic appointment (e.g., tenure-line versus non-tenure-line) as well as the particular focus of the faculty appointment (research, teaching, or service).  For tenure-line faculty, “When the University awards tenure to faculty, they in turn accept a responsibility to grow and change to meet evolving needs. Faculty members have a right to expect their colleagues to develop new competencies that keep departments and schools current. Department chairs must be able to rely on the support of all faculty when encouraging individuals to develop competencies needed for the unit's vitality” (IUPUI Supplement, p. 169). The expectation that faculty will grow and develop in order to keep the disciplines in which they work current and relevant extends to all faculty ranks, not just tenure-line faculty.  Furthermore, as the expectations and requirements of higher education evolve, faculty appointments may necessarily evolve over time. As noted in the IUPUI Faculty Council Faculty Work document with regard to initial faculty appointments, “While letters of offer must be reviewed carefully and while the university, campus, and school are each committed to honoring them, faculty must recognize that conditions of work can change. Individual faculty members should expect to contribute proportionately to program, departmental, or school norms for the faculty. In some units, research and/or teaching expectations differed when some faculty members were initially appointed. Accordingly, those faculty members should expect to accept added responsibilities that bring their overall level of contribution to the program, departmental, or school norm” (p. 5).  Among the professional obligations of their appointments, faculty are expected to meet deadlines given by the department, school and campus for all activities related to their positions, including – but not limited to – deadlines for: book orders, syllabi, final grades, PUL assessments, student course evaluations, Faculty Annual Reports, committee activities (e.g., primary, annual review, P&T).  As stated in the IU Academic Handbook’s Policy on Academic Freedom, “Academic freedom, accompanied by responsibility, attaches to all aspects of a teacher’s and librarian’s professional conduct. The teacher and librarian shall have full freedom of investigation, subject to adequate fulfillment of other academic duties.” Indiana University, including the School of Liberal Arts, “is committed to the concept of academic freedom and recognizes that such freedom, accompanied by responsibility, attaches to all aspects of a teacher’s or librarian’s professional conduct. Within this context, each person observes the regulations of the University, and maintains the right to criticize and to seek revision and reform. … Above all, he or she strives to be an effective teacher, scholar, librarian, or administrator.” As the IUPUI Faculty Work Policy summarizes, “Academic freedom ensures that faculty can pursue their scholarly interests, but only insofar as they meet their responsibilities to their unit” (p. 1).  DISTRIBUTION OF ACADEMIC EFFORT  All faculty have responsibilities in the areas of teaching, research and/or service, depending on the nature of their appointments. It is understood that any faculty member’s weekly distribution of effort is going to ebb and flow during the course of a semester and academic year as teaching, service, and research responsibilities and demands shift. Even so, over the course of their appointment, faculty effort normally falls within the following parameters.  1. Faculty Classifications  1.1. Tenure-Line Faculty For the School, the standard distribution of effort for tenure-line faculty is forty percent (40%) research, forty percent (40%) teaching, and twenty percent (20%) service. The standard distribution of academic effort for tenure-line faculty may have some variability depending on the focus of scholarship (research, teaching, and/or service) and disciplinary expectations.  1.2. Lecturer-Line Faculty The standard distribution of academic effort for lecturer-line faculty is eighty percent (80%) teaching and twenty percent (20%) service.  1.3. Other Faculty Lines The school also hires a limited number of faculty in other types of faculty lines, including clinical, research, post-doctorate, and academic specialist lines. The distribution of academic effort for each of these lines is dependent on the specific appointment and is determined at the time of (re)appointment.  2. 10-month and 12-month appointments  Faculty hold either 10-month or 12-month appointments; a faculty member’s appointment length may change depending on changes in responsibilities of the faculty over time.  2.1. Start-End Dates Faculty on 10-month appointments are paid over the 10-month period of August 1 to May 31 of each year. Faculty are expected to be available to be on campus no later than seven days prior to the first day of classes in August, and to be available to be on campus through at least the day of commencement in May or the submission of final Spring Semester grades, whichever is later.  Twelve-month appointments run from July 1 to June 30.  2.2. Vacations and Holidays All faculty receive the following seven holidays each year: Labor Day (1 day), Thanksgiving (2 days – Thanksgiving Day and Friday after Thanksgiving), Christmas (1 day), New Years Day (1 day), MLK Day (1 day) Memorial Day (1 day). Faculty on 12­month appointments also receive Independence Day (1 day).  Faculty on 10-month appointments do not receive vacation time. Except for the holidays listed above, faculty are expected to provide full effort to their appointments, and be available for collaboration, even when classes are not in session, including during fall, winter and spring breaks.  Faculty on 12-month appointments are entitled to vacation days as outlined in the IU Academic Handbook.  2.3. Absence from Campus Faculty are required to assure class coverage (e.g., guest speaker, on-line lecture, extended project) in the event of their absence for any reason, and must secure approval from the chair/director for any travel that may significantly impact teaching and/or service obligations. Faculty should inform their chairs/directors whenever a class session is missed due to illness or other unforeseen event.  2.4. Leaves Indiana University allows for and supports a variety of types of leaves – including sabbatical, sick, and family medical (FMLA) leaves, among others – as described in the IU Academic Handbook. Requests for leaves of any type are typically discussed first with the department chair or program director in consultation with the Dean’s Office. The School policy on sabbatical-like leaves for senior lecturers is given in Appendix Three.  TEACHING EXPECTATIONS  For all faculty members, teaching assignments must balance the school’s need for undergraduate and graduate teaching, and give preference to coverage of courses required for majors as well as courses that meet campus general education core and school competency requirements. At times during a faculty member’s career, these needs may require adjustments in the combination of courses he or she teaches (e.g., with respect to topic, level, frequency of particular offerings, etc.)  Assigning faculty to specific courses is complex and, as noted in the IUPUI Supplement to the IU Academic Handbook, faculty have a right to “fair and equitable treatment that withstands review among peers and is within program expectations;” chairs and program directors are expected to consult with faculty with regard to their teaching preferences, but “no absolute right exists with regard to assignment or effort distribution” (p. 166). Chairs and directors, in consultation with the Associate Dean for Academic Programs and subject to the approval of the Dean, have the responsibility for creating course schedules, based on curricular requirements and student needs, as well as the authority to assign faculty to teach them, including when (terms, days, times) as well as mode (face-to-face, online, etc.).  All faculty with teaching assignments are expected to: hold regular office hours (in person or virtually, as appropriate); respond in a timely manner to students; keep current in their fields and with teaching pedagogy; develop syllabi and course requirements that meet department, school, and campus requirements; assess student learning/performance, provide students with regular feedback on their learning/performance, and submit grades and other assessments by posted due dates; and administer and reflect on student course evaluations.  When teaching is part of the faculty assignment, effectiveness is an essential criterion for evaluation and advancement. Faculty must demonstrate command of their subject matter, continuous growth in the subject field, and an ability to create and maintain instructional environments to promote student learning.  1. Teaching Loads 1.1. Tenure-Line Faculty  Consequently, faculty who are actively involved in a school PhD program may be eligible for a 2-2 teaching load, with the recommendation of the chair at the time of the Faculty Annual Review and subject to the approval of the Dean.  1.2. Lecturer-Line Faculty  1.3. Clinical-Line Faculty  All reductions in teaching loads are subject to the approval of the Dean. (See section on redistribution of academic efforts.)  2. Student Evaluations  All faculty, regardless of appointment or rank, are required to administer student evaluations in every section of every class that is part of their teaching load in every term, including summer sessions. (NOTE: Independent studies and other such courses typically are not part of a faculty’s teaching load and so do not require student evaluations.)  According to school policies and guidelines, student evaluations are used to provide information to help document excellent or effective teaching, and are a necessary component of faculty annual review, annual merit salary increase recommendations, teaching award nominations, and promotion and/or tenure dossiers.  All faculty are expected to use the student evaluations approved by the Faculty Assembly. Evaluations must be administered to students by the deadline communicated to the faculty and staff for that particular term, but in any event no later than the last day of classes in the term. The results and/or analyses of the course evaluations are not to be shared with the faculty member until after grades have been submitted for that term.  Formal student evaluations, including both quantitative and qualitative feedback, are considered part of the faculty member’s personnel record and so should be handled accordingly. Section Three of the IUPUI Supplement outlines campus policy with regard to the right of faculty access to student evaluations.  3. Peer Review  As stated in the IUPUI Supplement to the IU Academic Handbook, “the concept of peer review underlies policies associated with observing and assessing faculty performance… Although each unit should develop its own practices in regard to peer review, faculty must also acknowledge the obligation of chairs/deans or their delegates to observe colleagues’ teaching activities, in both physical and online teaching environments ” (p. 167). In addition, as stated in the IUPUI P&T Guidelines, evaluation by peers “should occur continuously across the career in the form of regular peer review of teaching, research and creative activity, and service” (2014-15, p. 25).  Peer review of teaching is primarily a formative activity to facilitate ongoing reflection on and development of skill in teaching throughout one’s teaching career. Therefore, there is often no rank requirement with regard to who provides a teaching review, even for the purposes of P&T (see IUPUI P&T Guidelines, 2014-15, p. 18). However, there are times when summative peer reviews are needed, along with other indicators, to contribute to the evaluation of faculty members’ educational strategies and effectiveness as a teacher, and so in these situations peer review by faculty of the same or higher rank will be most appropriate.  The expectations for peer review, formative or summative as appropriate, are as follows:  4. Policy on Accumulated Overload Instruction  Full-time faculty of all ranks in the IU School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI regularly provide instruction, for student graduate or undergraduate credit, in excess of their standard teaching load. Such overload credit instruction is typically given in the form of individualized major or capstone course requirements, directed reading or writing courses, independent research courses, as well as M.A. thesis direction and certain types of internships.  Faculty members who have accrued 45 credit hours of such overload instruction may request to use these credit hours to replace one 3-credit hour course in their normal teaching load.  Any request for overload teaching credit should be submitted with documentation of the faculty member’s contributions and resulting outcomes (course/thesis, credit hours, section number, semester, year, student names, and short description of faculty work) and negotiated with the Department Chair prior to the finalization of the course schedule for the semester in which it may be credited.  It is expected that the Faculty Member and the Department Chair will be in regular consultation about the accumulation of overload credit, and plans for the semester in which it will be credited. Should such advance consultation not have taken place, the credit can still be authorized, but the Chair has the option of delaying the implementation of the overload teaching credit for up to one academic year.  Any overload teaching credit is subject to the approval of the Dean of the School of Liberal Arts.  5. Summer Teaching for Faculty on 10-month Appointments  Faculty on 10-month appointments are eligible to teach up to six credit hours during the summer on a separate summer appointment. Summer teaching is not guaranteed; course assignments are based on curricular need, student enrollment, and faculty expertise, and chairs/directors are responsible for the fair and appropriate assignment of summer courses. Summer teaching appointments beyond 6 credits are overloads, and so require approval by the school and the Academic Affairs Office. Salary rates for summer instruction are set by the school.  RESEARCH AND CREATIVE ACTIVITY  1. Tenure-Line Faculty  As stated in the IUPUI Supplement to the IU Academic Handbook, “tenured and tenure-track faculty are expected to combine teaching, research, and service at performance levels that their departmental and unit peers regard as satisfactory or better. It is assumed that tenure-related faculty members spend some time in research, appropriately balanced by teaching and service. If time spent in research will impinge on expectations of effort in the other two areas beyond what is considered normative, the faculty member must obtain the consent of the administrative officer [that is, the chair/director and the dean]. It is further assumed that faculty members' research relates to the unit's mission, documented by such measures of accountability as individual faculty annual reports (FAR)” (p. 166).  1.1. Expectations By definition, tenure-line faculty members have a responsibility, regardless of rank, to pursue and maintain active research and/or creative activity agendas that (a) lead to the regular dissemination of peer-reviewed publications/products/activities/exhibits in venues (including print, digital, or visual) appropriate for their research/creative activity, and (b) over time lead to or maintain national and/or international recognition of their scholarship.  1.2. Course Release for Research/Creative Activity: Research and creative activity are central to the role of tenured and tenure-track faculty members in the School. To foster this, tenure-line faculty are eligible for a one course reduction in teaching from the six course standard, upon recommendation of the department chair or program director and approval of the dean, at the time of the faculty annual review. In addition, faculty are expected to demonstrate at least satisfactory performance in teaching and service at the time of the faculty annual review to be eligible for a course release for research/creative activity.  As a School of Liberal Arts, we take a broad perspective in defining research and scholarly activity. Scholarly activity is most often associated with research, but can also encompass creative and applied activities, teaching, and extension/professional practice. Importantly, scholarly activity results in what is generally called “intellectual property,” which can be shared with, reviewed, and validated by peers and other appropriate parties beyond the university. Indicators of scholarly activity that may merit a course reduction include but are not limited to:  It is neither practicable nor appropriate to impose a strict formula to apply these criteria in judging individual faculty research for purposes of a course release. However, examples of scholarly activity that may warrant a course release might include several journal articles and/or book chapters within the previous five years, a refereed book within the previous five to seven years, or the equivalent level of appropriately reviewed products/activity – including public and applied – disseminated in outlets of appropriate quality. Tenure-line faculty who have more intensive scholarly productivity may request an additional course reduction for a particular year by requesting a ‘redistribution of academic effort,’ as described in the section below.  In some instances, such as the development of a book, progress in the form of draft chapters will serve as an indicator of significant scholarly activity; similarly, other activities like research presentations at professional meetings, the submission of grant proposals, public performances and the collection and analyses of data may also reflect significant scholarly activity during a particular year. However, although these activities are indicators of scholarly work, in order to maintain eligibility for a research release, faculty are expected to engage in research/creative activity that leads to publication or some other substantive peer- or otherwise appropriately reviewed product/activity/grant within a meaningful period of time. Chairs are asked to consider these issues and to allow course releases for research in a manner consistent with department and disciplinary standards for what constitutes ongoing research, subject to annual review and approval by the Dean of the School of Liberal Arts.  Faculty whose scholarly activity does not warrant a course reduction are still expected to meet department or program expectations for research at the time of the faculty annual review by at least showing evidence of progress on an appropriate scholarly agenda.  NOTE: Promotion and/or tenure decisions are based on a separate evaluation of overall excellence and impact on a discipline over time.  2. Non-Tenure-Line Faculty  Some non-tenure-line appointments, such as research professors and research associates, have research expectations, which are described in their letters of appointment. These faculty who do not have teaching appointments also have the responsibility to pursue and maintain active research and/or creative activity agendas that (a) lead to the regular dissemination of peer-reviewed publications/products/activities/exhibits in venues (including print, digital, or visual) appropriate for their research/creative activity, and (b) over time lead to or maintain national and/or international recognition of their scholarship Teaching is a scholarly and dynamic endeavor that covers a broad range of activities. However, clinical and lecturer-line faculty by definition do not have research expectations. Even so, as indicated in the campus promotion and tenure guidelines, “evidence of regular and significant local/regional peer reviewed dissemination of good practice” is required for promotion to senior lecturer, and “some level of national peer-reviewed dissemination of [teaching/service] scholarship is required to document excellence” for promotion for clinical faculty. Clinical and lecture-line faculty are encouraged to pursue and disseminate the results of activities relating to teaching or service, as appropriate for their appointments, and such activity and/or products should be evaluated as part of their annual reviews and for consideration of salary increases and/or promotion where applicable.  SERVICE EXPECTATIONS  All faculty are expected to contribute 20% of their effort each year toward service to the department/program, school, campus, university, community, and/or profession (although chairs may grant tenure-eligible faculty in the first years of their appointment a lighter load, keeping in mind that promotion and tenure does require satisfactory performance in service). There are no full-time faculty appointments in the School of Liberal Arts that are exempt from service responsibilities. All full-time faculty have basic service obligations to their departments/programs, the school, and the campus. As noted in the IFC Faculty Work document, “University, campus, school, departmental, and community service responsibilities should be determined equitably among faculty members” (p. 4).  At the department/program level, all faculty are expected to attend regularly and participate in department/program meetings, serve on primary and annual review committees as assigned, and contribute to and provide leadership for other committees (e.g., graduate admissions, curriculum, awards) as appropriate. At the school/campus level, all faculty are expected to attend regularly the Faculty Assembly, serve regularly on committees (if and as appropriate for their rank/appointment), periodically hold leadership roles (e.g., chair) on school and/or campus committees, and attend at least one school/campus-level event each year: Commencement, the Celebration of Scholarship, the Graduating Student Reception, the Chancellor’s Honors Convocation and/or the Taylor Symposium. Chairs should encourage and take note of service performed and functions attended. Faculty may also provide service at the community and/or professional level as part of their service activities (e.g., serving on or chairing committees or task forces, organizing conference sessions or exhibits, peer reviewing manuscripts, writing reports or book reviews).  Service activities compensated by consulting fees or by supplemental pay are understood to be in addition to regular service activities; they may be credited as service for the purpose of tenure and promotion.  Faculty must take care not to proliferate their service activities to the detriment of their research, teaching, and normal personal life and should turn down offers beyond expected service not suitable to their interests and effectiveness.  Faculty who have service opportunities or obligations that are beyond the 20% of their effort that is part of their appointment may request a redistribution of academic effort (see below).  RECOGNIZING, REWARDING, & COMPENSATING FACULTY WORK  1. Redistribution of Academic Effort  Unless described in a letter of appointment from the dean, any redistribution of academic effort from the standards outlined above in terms of percentages of effort in teaching/research/service and/or teaching load requires the approval of the dean and a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to be added to the faculty member’s personnel file that details the approved changes and includes a time table for review and renewal. (NOTE: In the case of appointments by the chair of faculty to interdepartmental appointments such as lead advisor, director of graduate studies, and department program director for which teaching load reductions are already defined by school policy, the MOU does not need the approval of the dean.)  Requests for redistribution of academic effort that is not already defined by school policy, including any changes in teaching load, must include the following: . A rationale for and a description of the project/position/activity for which the redistribution of effort is being requested.  Requests for redistribution of academic effort are typically submitted to the dean for approval at the time of the faculty annual review.  The Faculty Annual Review should clearly indicate any redistribution of effort and/or change in teaching/research/service load as well as include the description of the project/position/activity being done. The project/position/activity should be specifically evaluated by the chair/director in the faculty annual review.  2. Salary Policy (Updated March 6, 2015)  The School of Liberal Arts endorses merit pay as the basis for faculty salary adjustments, providing that the resulting salary structure is equitable and market-oriented. The salary adjustment categories and procedures identified below should lessen some of the problems faculty and administrators have identified, i.e., inequities within and among departments, compression between ranks, and unresponsiveness to market demands. The dean should allocate funds for all categories whenever meritorious cases for salary adjustment arise, although it should be noted that, while faculty salaries are to remain one of the highest budgetary priorities of the school, all adjustments are ultimately based on availability of funds within the school. The dean is responsible for deciding the appropriate distribution of salary adjustment sums allocated to individuals and departments. Likewise, although required to consult with faculty, the dean is ultimately responsible for final decisions on all salary adjustments. All faculty salary adjustments must fall under one of the categories, which are described below in order of priority.  2.1. Promotion Adjustment Promotion represents special merit and should carry a substantial extra reward separate from normal considerations of merit, market, and equity, although care must be taken to ensure that any combination of the adjustments does not skew the departmental or school salary structure. Promotions should carry a salary increase of 10% of the faculty member’s base salary at the time of promotion, based on a 10-month appointment, with the following minimum amounts (including tenure-lines, clinical/research lines and lecturer-lines):  2.2. Annual Merit Adjustment Merit will constitute the primary basis for annual salary adjustments. Merit pay must be tied to annual reviews, which are based upon the information provided in faculty annual reports, including the faculty member’s annual goals. Faculty goals should reflect the goals and requirements of the department and school, as well as the faculty member’s particular interests. Tenure-line faculty members will be assessed based upon their teaching, research, and service. Lecturers and clinical faculty will be assessed based upon on their teaching and service. In reviewing faculty annual reports, each department should adopt standards for ranking faculty performance as significantly exceeding department expectations, exceeding department expectations, meeting department expectations, performing below department expectations, or offering unsatisfactory performance. As noted in the SLA Annual Summary Review Form, each department shall determine the relative weight that teaching and service for lecturers – and teaching, research and service for tenure-line faculty – count toward the overall evaluation of the faculty member. Each year, the dean will provide departments with a pool of money for all merit adjustments. The department is responsible for distributing those funds according to department policy. The dean should make every effort to make appropriate annual adjustment allocations to the departments.  2.3. Other Adjustments  2.3.1. Market Adjustment The School of Liberal Arts should pay competitive market salaries to recruit and retain high quality faculty. Market adjustments should be made when departments demonstrate empirically that an individual faculty member can command a higher salary elsewhere in academe. Such empirical evidence typically requires presentation of a competing offer. Market adjustments should go only to faculty members whose last two annual reviews indicate that they have exceeded department expectations as measured by departmental standards. Faculty members who have an offer from another institution may present their request for a salary increase to their department chair, or to the director of the institute or program to which their primary responsibilities lie, who will forward the faculty member’s request to the dean, along with the formal offer from the other institution, faculty member’s c.v., last two annual reviews, and a letter either recommending or not recommending the adjustment. If an increase is granted, the adjustment can be made over a period of years.  2.3.2. Equity Adjustment In any merit system for which no predictable adjustment pool exists, some faculty members may fall behind in salary compared to colleagues with similar career accomplishments. The SLA believes such faculty members should be offered equitable compensation with such peers. Upon submitting salary recommendations each spring, the chair/director will notify any faculty members whose performance has been judged by their department to have exceeded department expectations and whose salary has fallen to below 90% of the average salary of all other faculty in their department in their rank. Faculty members with joint appointments should be compared with all other faculty of their rank in all of the departments or programs to which they are appointed. If a department does not have multiple faculty members in a particular rank, a faculty member in that rank may compare his or her salary to faculty in the same rank in other SLA departments with comparable salary structures.  Faculty members who wish to pursue an equity adjustment should petition their chair, or the chair or director of the department, institute or program to which their primary responsibilities lie (hereafter chair), who is responsible for reviewing the faculty member’s claims for equity adjustment based upon the department or program’s standards for ranking faculty performance. A faculty petition for equity adjustment should include a statement offering reasons for the raise, along with copies of the petitioner’s c.v. and last two annual reviews.  If the chair agrees with the faculty member that an equity adjustment is called for, the case is sent with the chair’s recommendation to the dean. If the dean and the chair agree on their findings, they will negotiate an equity adjustment for the faculty member in question.  If the chair disagrees with the faculty member that an equity adjustment is appropriate, the case is sent with the chair’s recommendation to the Faculty Enhancement Committee. The chair should also send a copy of the petition and recommendation to the dean. The Faculty Enhancement Committee will review the case and forward its recommendation to the dean, with copies forwarded to the petitioning faculty member and the chair. The dean’s decision will be based on the recommendations of both the chair and the Faculty Enhancement Committee.  If the dean approves an equity adjustment, the salary pool allocated by the dean’s office will ordinarily be responsible for 100% of the monies necessary for the raise. However, if the dean feels the equity shortfall stems from systematic undervaluation of the faculty member’s contributions over a period of years, the dean may refer the case to the Faculty Enhancement Committee. If that committee agrees with the dean’s findings, it will suggest an appropriate and reasonable distribution of the funding of the equity enhancement between department and dean’s office funds. The dean will then determine the appropriate distribution of the funding of the equity adjustment based on the Faculty Enhancement Committee’s recommendation, and in consultation with the chair. In cases of joint or adjunct appointments, all chairs or program directors involved in funding the equity adjustment will be involved in this process.  If an equity adjustment is granted, the adjustment can be made over a period of years, normally not more than three. If a petition for an equity adjustment is denied, the faculty member must wait twelve months before filing a new petition.  3. Adjunct Faculty  3.1. Description The term “adjunct” is used by the campus to refer to three distinct types of adjunct faculty:  According to the IU Academic Handbook:  Within the School of Liberal Arts, for the purposes of this policy, academic “units” are defined as “departments.” Consequently, adjunct faculty do not have voting privileges within departments to which they have adjunct appointments. However, faculty who have adjunct appointments within independent programs (i.e., programs not housed in departments) in the School are afforded the same voting privileges in faculty governance that they otherwise hold within their primary appointment.  Typically, school faculty with adjunct appointments still retain their full responsibilities for teaching, service, and research (as appropriate) within their home departments, unless otherwise negotiated with a Memorandum of Understanding. In situations where MOUs are drafted, it should be considered whether a joint appointment is more appropriate.  The School P&T Guidelines provide additional guidance with regard to adjunct appointments for faculty who are seeking promotion and/or tenure.  3.2. Adjunct Appointments  The request for an adjunct appointment for a full-time IU employee to a department or program must include:  Passed by the Faculty Assembly by electronic ballot on December 12, 2014  APPENDIX 1  IUPUI Civility Statement  The IUPUI community has dedicated itself to creating an environment where each individual is valued and can succeed. Our institutional ethic compels us to foster the best possible environment for doing our work as educators, learners, and supporters of the educational process. When our members are prevented from doing their best, the entire community is diminished. Our commitment to be a diverse and inclusive campus relies on all community members to do their part. While no set of rules or policies can wholly govern human conduct, civility requires respect and a thoughtful and careful balancing of differing points of view.  As members of an institution of higher learning, we must periodically reaffirm the fundamental ethics and values that form the framework for our university. This means fostering a climate of acceptance, mutual respect, academic freedom, and civil discourse.

    "body": "  # National Training Academy to Combat HIV Criminalization to Be Held at IUPUI  Thursday, April 12, 2018  On June 3-6, 2018, advocates, activists, researchers, and community leaders will meet on the IUPUI campus in Tower/Hine Hall to participate in HIV is Not a Crime III , the third national training academy to mobilize state-level advocacy to end HIV-related criminalization.  [HIV is Not a Crime III](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/hiv-is-not-a-crime-iii-national-training-academy-tickets-42139609707)  Thirty-three states, including Indiana, and several jurisdictions globally, have outdated HIV-specific statutes that apply to people living with HIV. These laws unjustly penalize any alleged or perceived HIV exposure, regardless of intent to harm or risks therein.  The Sero Project and Positive Women’s Network-USA , the two largest national networks of people living with HIV (PLHIV) has organized the three-day educational training for 300 participants. A two-day, invitation only, Black United Leadership pre-institute will also take place on June 1-2 to train the next generation of Black advocates to address HIV criminalization reform.  [Sero Project](http://www.seroproject.com/)  [Positive Women’s Network-USA ,](https://www.pwn-usa.org/)  Participants and presenters will include advocates, many living with HIV, from over 30 states, Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, Belize, Germany and England.  Carrie Foote, Sociology associate professor , IU School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI and several of her students, are working closely with the training organizers to host the event.  Foote has been living with HIV for 30 years and chairs the HIV Modernization Movement-Indiana , which aims to modernize Indiana’s HIV criminal laws .  [Carrie Foote, Sociology associate professor](https://www.hivplusmag.com/stigma/2016/8/24/injection-drug-user-turned-professor-activist-carrie-foote-16-75-amazing-hiv-people)  [HIV Modernization Movement-Indiana](http://hivmodernizationmovement.org/)  [Indiana’s HIV criminal laws](http://hivmodernizationmovement.org/laws/)  Foote explained, “Science has made extraordinary advances since the HIV epidemic began in the 1980s, but one area that hasn’t kept up are laws that criminalize HIV. Lacking in scientific merit, these harmful laws stigmatize PLHIV and are counterproductive to public health.”  Register to attend  Anyone living with HIV (PLHIV), stakeholders, policy leaders, and advocates are encouraged to attend the three-day training in Indianapolis, IN to learn about mobilizing state-level advocacy to end HIV-related criminalization. Online registration is open through May 18.

    "body": "  ## Proposed Revised Exit Survey  TO:                  SLA Faculty Assembly Executive Committee  FROM:             Teaching and Advising Committee  SUBJECT:        Proposed Revised Exit Survey  DATE:             January 15, 2021    The Teaching and Advising Committee recommends the following action item for consideration by the Faculty:  Adoption of the Most Recent Draft of the Senior Graduation Exit Survey  Current situation :  As brought to the attention of the Faculty Assembly earlier, The Teaching & Advising Committee is planning to re-establish the graduation survey, to be administered through Qualtrics.  The Teaching and Advising Committee has sought and received feedback and approval from the Faculty Assembly on this project.  The committee also has collaborated with Student Affairs, had the survey vetted by IRDS, and had it tested with a small group of students.  We would now like for the Faculty Assembly to read the most recent version and approve it for a more extended use with students this spring (2021).  Proposed action :  We ask the Faculty Assembly to read the most recent version of the graduation exit survey, the SLA Graduating Student Exit Survey, and approve its use in spring 2021.  Rationale :  The School of Liberal Arts used to be able to collect survey data from graduating seniors to be used to assess the student experience and to make adjustments to enhance the student experience.  We now wish to re-establish the use of an exit survey, the SLA Graduating Student Exit Survey, for that purpose.  The purpose of the survey is to gather information from students about their experiences with the School of Liberal Arts.  While some of the questions are similar to those in a campus-wide alumni survey that IRDS will send to alumni three to five years post-graduation (which focuses on the overall IUPUI experience), this survey asks specific questions about SLA services and educational experiences and will gather information on the student experience in the School of Liberal Arts from students as they approach graduation.  Known and expected benefits :  Students will find greater value in their educational experience in the School of Liberal Arts because as a school, we will be able to revise, adapt, and enhance that experience with the information we receive from the surveys.  In addition, programs will receive data that they can use to track student response and that they can use for future planning.

    "body": "  # Bahr honored as Liberal Arts Chancellor’s Scholar  Wednesday, April 25, 2018  Ask Sarah Bahr about her weekend plans and she will rattle off an itinerary of performances at the Phoenix Theatre, the Indiana Reparatory Theatre, the Hilbert Circle Theatre, maybe a cultural festival, and probably some interviews for articles she is writing.  When does she have time to study three majors, two minors, work in the Writing Center and the dean’s office, help edit genesis -- the student literary magazine, and freelance for Indianapolis Monthly ? It must happen sometime. One doesn’t just become the 2018 Chancellor’s Scholar in the School of Liberal Arts without opening a book.  Bahr, a Harry Potter fan, swears her time-turner necklace is just a replica and magically manipulating her schedule isn’t an option. Her secret is a relentless work ethic, a love of learning, and a dislike of boredom that has been with her since begging her mother to teach her how to read at the age of three. Bahr’s mom held off for a year, but by the time Bahr was five she was well versed in the adventures of Junie B. Jones , a book series that suggests a starting age of six.  Throughout elementary school, her mother supplemented classroom learning with additional workbooks. She wasn’t a tiger mom pushing her daughter to excellence, Bahr insists. She was a mother trying to keep her child entertained. “My mom characterizes me as ‘kind of bored’ in first grade so she added workbooks on top of school to keep me challenged,” Bahr recalls. “Even in the summer, I had homework so I built on what I learned during the school year. I think it's safe to say I had a strong desire to learn.”  That desire to learn has yet to be quenched. Bahr will soon graduate with degrees in English, Spanish, and Journalism and minors in literature and women’s studies. During her time as a student she also worked as a reporter for the Campus Citizen and served as a School of Liberal Arts ambassador. She’ll return to IUPUI and the School of Liberal Arts in the fall as a graduate student studying literature.  As her undergrad career winds down, Bahr has also been named outstanding English major, the Journalism and PR academic achievement award winner, and a Plater Civic Medallion recipient. She placed as an IUPUI top 100 student twice, this year being selected as a top 10 recipient.  Previous awards include The Indiana Outstanding College Student of Spanish Award given by the American Association of Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese in Indiana, 13 writing awards from Purdue University’s annual literary contest, and numerous academic honors and scholarships.  Only one student in each IUPUI academic school is named a Chancellor’s Scholar. Students are selected based on criteria that includes being in the final year of their degree work and having the highest grade point average in the unit. Bahr’s academic advisor, Rosa Tezanos-Pinto, associate professor of Spanish, notes that in spite of the many demands of her majors and minors, Bahr has been on the Dean’s List since her freshman year, maintained a 4.0 GPA and has been one of the most prominent Honors College students.  “It's much more difficult to motivate myself to work on an assignment if I know the finished product isn't going to be the best it can be,” Bahr says. “For instance, why should I even bother finishing this paper if I know the end product isn't going to reflect all the research I've put in on the front end? Don't I owe it to myself to make it the best it can be?”  Bahr has also managed to build a substantial portfolio of published writing that includes work from Indianapolis Monthly , The Indianapolis Star , Forbes Travel Guide , and Hektoen International , a medical humanities journal that often publishes the work of professionals and Ph.Ds. She also covered the 2018 Rose Bowl in Pasadena, CA, as part of the Sports Capital Journalism Program. This summer she will work at The Indianapolis Star as a Pulliam Fellow.  \"I'm honored to be recognized for my four years of contributions to the school and am grateful to all the professors whose diligent mentorship and persistent encouragement have helped me surpass benchmarks I never thought I'd hit,” Bahr says. “I look forward to doing even more great things this fall when I return to the School of Liberal Arts for graduate school.\" "

    "body": "  # Dr. Edward Curtis receives 2023 national book award from the Arab American National Museum  Wednesday, September 20, 2023  Dr. Edward Curtis, William M. and Gail M. Plater Chair of the Liberal Arts and Professor of Religious Studies in the IU School of Liberal Arts has been awarded the 2023 Evelyn Shakir Non-Fiction Arab American Book Award from the Arab American National Museum . Curtis’ book, Muslims of the Heartland: How Syrian Immigrants Made a Home in the American Midwest explores the world of the first two generations of Arab Muslims who settled in the Midwest in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, offering an intimate portrait of fifteen women and men who lived in the Dakotas, Indiana, Iowa, and Michigan.  [Arab American National Museum](https://arabamericanmuseum.org/2023-arab-american-book-award-winners/)  [Muslims of the Heartland: How Syrian Immigrants Made a Home in the American Midwest](https://nyupress.org/9781479812561/muslims-of-the-heartland/)  “I shed a tear or two of joy when I received the news,” said Curtis. “It means so much that the book award comes from the Arab American National Museum.”  Of all the Great Lakes states, Indiana controls the smallest amount of shoreline. Just forty-five miles along Lake Michigan.  But that small slice of land has been essential to the state’s economic, social, and it turns out, cultural contributions to U.S. history.  It is home, for example, to one of Indiana’s most popular tourist attractions, the freshwater sand dunes formed over thousands of years by waves and winds from the country’s largest inland lake.  But it’s probably fair to say that when most Hoosiers think of the long-gone Hoosier Slide, the largest single dune along Lake Michigan, they don’t often imagine Arabic-speaking Muslims among the many tourists sliding down its two hundred feet of sand in the early 1900s.  This long lost chapter of Indiana history has now been brought to light by Edward Curtis , William M. and Gail M. Plater Chair of the Liberal Arts and Professor of Religious Studies. Curtis’ book, Muslims of the Heartland: How Syrian Immigrants Made a Home in the American Midwest , recently won the Evelyn Shakir Non-Fiction Arab American Book Award from the Arab American National Museum .  [Edward Curtis](https://liberalarts.iupui.edu/departments/religious-studies/directory/edward-curtis/)  [Muslims of the Heartland: How Syrian Immigrants Made a Home in the American Midwest](https://nyupress.org/9781479812561/muslims-of-the-heartland/)  [Arab American National Museum](https://arabamericanmuseum.org/2023-arab-american-book-award-winners/)  The first historian to detail Indiana’s early contributions to Islam in the United States, Curtis recreates what it was like along Lake Michigan for Arabic-speaking immigrants in Michigan City from the 1890s to the 1930s.  “They were among the half a million Lebanese and Syrians who left their native lands for the Americas before 1920,” Curtis says. They arrived in Michigan City to work at Haskell and Barker, a railroad car maker and Indiana’s largest employer at the time.    Most of them were Christian, but there was also a vital Muslim minority. In 1931, that Muslim minority made history by establishing what is the longest-running mosque in Indiana.  “Detroit is often associated with the history of Muslim Americans,” Curtis explains, “but this mosque, called Asser El Jadeed, predates any of the Arab Muslim congregations currently operating in Greater Detroit.”  Curtis hopes his research will reclaim Indiana’s stake in the larger story of Islam in America.  “This story,” he claims, “is about much more than religion, and the contributions of these immigrants will probably surprise a lot of Hoosiers.”  His book, for example, examines the role of Syrian Muslims in fueling Michigan City’s culture of wrestling. Older Syrians would train their young to compete in tournaments, which were a major source of entertainment for Michigan City residents in 1900. “Michigan City even hosted a fan club for a popular wrestler Yussife Hussane, whose wrestling moniker was ‘The Terrible Turk,’” says Curtis.  In addition, Curtis’ Muslims of the Heartland details how Michigan City’s first draftee during World War I was a Muslim man named Mohamed Debojah (Debaja), who served along with other Syrian and Lebanese immigrants, both Christian and Muslim, in both World War I and II.  Curtis, who himself is a descendant of Syrian-Lebanese immigrants who settled in Southern Illinois in the 1890s, says that the ultimate aim of this research is to encourage Hoosiers and other Midwesterners to celebrate the racial, ethnic, and religious history of the heartland.  “Some of us in the Midwest have . . . forgotten who we are,” according to Curtis. “The truth is that we have always been diverse. I hope more of us celebrate this multicultural heritage.”  Curtis will be honored during the Arab American National Museum award ceremony in November. "

    "body": " SLA FACULTY ANNUAL REVIEW GUIDELINES  IUPUI, including the School of Liberal Arts, has a mandated annual review policy for all faculty (IUPUI Faculty Guide, 2016, p. 70).  It is the responsibility of SLA Department Chairs and all SLA faculty (including chairs and faculty in school administrative appointments) to complete the FACULTY ANNUAL REVIEW FORM by the deadline established each year by the Office of the Dean.  The annual review of SLA faculty members serves multiple purposes, as designated by IU, IUPUI, and School policies and guidelines. These purposes include:  •     Provide input on progress in the areas of teaching, research (as appropriate) and service, including calling attention to weaknesses as well as strengths in a manner that provides all faculty their rights and privileges ( IUPUI Faculty Guide ); •     Determination of levels of merit pay ( IU-policy, School Faculty Work Document ); •     Review and reappointment of non-tenured faculty, including: lecturers, clinical faculty, academic specialists, research associates ( I U-policy, IUPUI Faculty Guide ); •     Review of tenure-track faculty to evaluate progress toward P&T as well as reappointment ( I UPUI P&T Guidelines, IUPUI Faculty Guide ); •     Recommendations (for tenure-line faculty) of course release for research ( School Faculty Work D ocument ); •     Recommendation of course release for PhD program support ( School Faculty Work Document ); •     Identification and approval of goals and areas of professional development ( School Faculty A nnual Review Guidelines, School Enhancement Review Guidelines ); •     Evaluation of and/or recommendation for redistribution of academic effort ( School Faculty Work D ocument ); •     Determination of overall satisfactory performance ( School Faculty Bylaws, IUPUI Faculty Guide, School Enhancement Review Guidelines ).  There are several parts to the annual review, including: •     The FACULTY ANNUAL REPORT (submitted online via Digital Measures); •     The CHECKLIST, which assures all steps have been completed, as appropriate; •     The ANNUAL SUMMARY REVIEW FORM; •     The CHAIR’S COMMENTS on the faculty member’s performance; •     The FACULTY MEMBER’S PROJECTED ACTIVITIES for the next calendar year (to be attached); •     Departmental evaluations of the faculty member (e.g., a review by a department’s primary or annual review committee), when they are done (to be attached). •     Indication of whether probationary faculty members are being recommended for reappointment or not.  (Note: recommendations for non-reappointment require a review by a committee of at least three members of appropriate rank.)  The annual review of each faculty member is to be conducted in a timely fashion in accord with departmental bylaws/guidelines and following the schedule established annually by the Dean. At a minimum, the annual review will be based primarily but not exclusively on the faculty member’s ANNUAL REPORT for the calendar year immediately preceding. Additional information for an annual review may be supplied by faculty or requested by a chair, appropriate persons in a department, or the Dean. Although the FACULTY ANNUAL REPORT covers the previous calendar year, the annual review may reflect current spring semester activities and note activity in prior years that is relevant to current review.  Tenure-line faculty, by definition, have research expectations as part of their appointment.  As indicated  in the School Faculty Work Document, “faculty are expected to engage in research/creative activity that leads to publication or some other substantive peer- or otherwise appropriately reviewed product/activity/grant within a meaningful period of time.”  In order to receive a course release each year, tenure-line faculty must show they have an active scholarly agenda (as described in the Faculty Work Document).  Because active scholars do not necessarily have peer-reviewed products every year, chairs are expected to evaluate scholarly activity over the past few years when making their recommendation for a course release for research/creative activity.  The chair’s brief written assessment should be based on the substance of the FACULTY ANNUAL REPORT and any additional information, as noted above. Written assessments by chairs or other parties must be provided to faculty prior to being forwarded with this form to the Dean (as noted above). Departments are strongly encouraged to include a peer-review component to the annual review process.  ANNUA L SUMMARY REVIEW FORM  The Annual Review Form summarizes the evaluation of the teaching, research (or other creative work), and service of faculty members according to the guidelines below. This form must be completed for every faculty member, including for the chair by a departmentally approved review committee . It should be completed by either the chair (or some other appropriately designated body within the faculty member’s department) and the faculty member, and signed by both. In the event of joint appointments, an ANNUAL REVIEW FORM should be completed following the terms outlined in the Memorandum of Understanding that outlines the terms of the joint appointment.  Each faculty member’s work for the preceding year in each of the areas of research, teaching, and service should be reviewed on the following scale using criteria approved by the department:  3 = Significantly exceeds department expectations 2 = Exceeds department expectations 1 = Meets department expectations 0 = Does not meet department expectations  As noted in the School Faculty Work Document (p. 2), the standard distribution of academic effort for tenure-line faculty is forty percent (40%) research, forty percent (40%) teaching, and twenty percent (20%) service. This distribution may have some variability depending on the focus of scholarship (research, teaching, and/or service) and disciplinary expectations, or as a result of administrative or other appointments. The standard distribution of academic effort for lecturer-line faculty is eighty percent (80%) teaching and twenty percent (20%) service. The distribution of academic effort for faculty in other appointments (e.g., clinical, research specialists) is dependent on the specific appointment and is determined at the time of (re)appointment.  Each department is expected to have clearly articulated criteria for evaluating faculty work as meeting, exceeding, or significantly exceeding department expectations in each of the three areas of teaching, research, and service that are in keeping with the expectations given in the School Faculty Work Document.  Using the standard distribution of academic effort for tenure-line faculty as an example, a faculty member who exceeds departmental criteria in teaching (2), significantly exceeds departmental criteria in research (3), and meets departmental criteria in service (1) would receive a Total Evaluation Score of 2.2 [= (2 x 0.4 = 0.8) + (3 x 0.4 = 1.2) + (1 x 0.2 = 0.2)].  EVALUAT IO N OF OVERALL SATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE  As indicated in the campus policy on Faculty/Librarian Review and Enhancement (IUPUI Faculty Handbook), one of the purposes of the annual review is to identify and inform faculty whose performance is “substandard” with regard to departmental and school expectations. The Faculty Work Document, adopted by the School Faculty Assembly describes what the school expectations are for each of the three areas of faculty work, which are copied below. Overall satisfactory performance assumes faculty performance in each of these areas, as appropriate, meets or exceeds department and school expectations .  U nsatisfactory Performance Faculty performance should only be evaluated as overall “unsatisfactory” when there is a clear and documented record of an inability or unwillingness to perform fundamental duties and/or by an absence of intellectual growth and productivity.  Determination of overall unsatisfactory performance should involve consideration of faculty activity in all the areas expected for their appointments; however, in the absence of mitigating circumstances , performance that does not meet expectations in one or more areas of work (teaching, research or service) typically indicates overall unsatisfactory performance.  Where the performance of a tenured faculty member in a given area is in danger of falling below the level of acceptability, the department should take early action to rectify the problem whenever possible. In some instances, the faculty member's responsibilities may be adjusted to take account of the situation, as long as adjustments are in keeping with the expectations outlined in the School Faculty Work Document and approved by the Dean. In all cases, the resources of the University for improving the performance of the individual should be made fully available to that faculty member.  As stated in the IUPUI Faculty/Librarian Review and Enhancement Policy, the School Bylaws, and the School Enhancement Review Guidelines, faculty who receive overall evaluations of “unsatisfactory” in two successive years are to be reviewed by the elected School Enhancement Review Committee.  School Expectations for Overall Satisfactory Performance The Faculty Work Document, approved by the School Faculty Assembly, defines school expectations for performance in each area of faculty work:  Teaching Expectations (pp. 4) “For all faculty members, teaching assignments must balance the school’s need for undergraduate and graduate teaching, and give preference to coverage of courses required for majors as well as courses that meet campus general education core and school competency requirements.  At times during a faculty member’s career, these needs may require adjustments in the combination of courses he or she teaches (e.g., with respect to topic, level, frequency of particular offerings, etc.)….  Chairs and directors, in consultation with the Associate Dean for Academic Programs and subject to the approval of the Dean, have the responsibility for creating course schedules, based on curricular requirements and student needs, as well as the authority to assign faculty to teach them, including when (terms, days, times) as well as mode (face-to-face, online, etc.). …  All faculty with teaching assignments are expected to: hold regular office hours (in person or virtually, as appropriate); respond in a timely manner to students; keep current in their fields and with teaching pedagogy; develop syllabi and course requirements that meet department, school, and campus requirements; assess student learning/performance, provide students with regular feedback on their learning/performance, and submit grades and other assessments by posted due dates; and administer and reflect on student course evaluations.  When teaching is part of the faculty assignment, effectiveness is an essential criterion for evaluation and advancement. Faculty must demonstrate command of their subject matter, continuous growth in the subject field, and an ability to create and maintain instructional environments to promote student learning. …  All faculty, regardless of appointment or rank, are required to administer student evaluations in every section of every class that is part of their teaching load in every term, including summer sessions.”  R esearch Expectations (tenure-line faculty) (pp. 7-8) “By definition, tenure-line faculty members have a responsibility, regardless of rank, to pursue and maintain active research and/or creative activity agendas that (a) lead to the regular dissemination of peer-reviewed publications/products/activities/exhibits in venues (including print, digital, or visual) appropriate for their research/creative activity, and (b) over time lead to or maintain national and/or international recognition of their scholarship. …  It is neither practicable nor appropriate to impose a strict formula to apply these criteria in judging individual faculty research for purposes of a course release. However, examples of scholarly activity that may warrant a course release might include several journal articles and/or book chapters within the previous five years, a refereed book within the previous five to seven years, or the equivalent level of appropriately reviewed products/activity – including public and applied – disseminated in outlets of appropriate quality.”  Service Expectations (tenure-line faculty) (p. 9) “There are no full-time faculty appointments in the School of Liberal Arts that are exempt from service responsibilities. All full-time faculty have basic service obligations to their departments/programs, the school, and the campus. …  At the department/program level, all faculty are expected to attend regularly and participate in department/program meetings, serve on primary and annual review committees as assigned, and contribute to and provide leadership for other committees (e.g., graduate admissions, curriculum, awards) as appropriate. At the school/campus level, all faculty are expected to attend regularly the Faculty Assembly, serve regularly on committees (if and as appropriate for their rank/appointment), periodically hold leadership roles (e.g., chair) on school and/or campus committees, and attend at least one school/campus-level event each year: Commencement, the Celebration of Scholarship, the Graduating Student Reception, the Chancellor’s Honors Convocation and/or the Taylor Symposium. Chairs should encourage and take note of service performed and functions attended.” "

    "body": "  # Religious Studies professor selected to co-lead study to explore enrollment patterns among minoritized racial and ethnic groups in Indiana’s Medicaid expansion  Friday, November 18, 2022  Dr. David Craig, Professor of Religious Studies, at the IU School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI, has been selected to participate in one of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s leadership programs. These programs connect changemakers across the country—from every profession and field—to learn from and work with one another in creating more just and thriving communities.  Prof. Craig was selected for Interdisciplinary Research Leaders. Designed for teams of one community partner and two research partners, Interdisciplinary Research Leaders supports teams as they work with their communities to design and conduct rigorous research to explore critical issues, then apply the findings in real time to advance health and equity. Prof. Craig is partnering with Dr. Elaine Hernandez, Assistant Professor of Sociology, IU-Bloomington, and Dr. Ivan Douglas Hicks, Pastor, First Baptist Church North Indianapolis.  As a member of the program’s newest cohort, Dr. Craig will focus on structural racism. The team will conduct a mixed methods study of the Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP), Indiana’s Medicaid expansion. When the federal public health emergency was declared in March 2020, the state of Indiana suspended certain program requirements for all Medicaid programs. HIP enrollment rose the most, increasing 75%. The team seeks to understand how enrollment patterns and health care utilization may have changed for HIP members from minoritized racial and ethnic groups. With the federal public health emergency ending in 2023, the team will work with community partners to develop a toolkit of supports to assist HIP members in keeping and using their health benefits.

    "body": "  ## Program Description   ### Certificate in Social Justice Organizing to Be Offered by IUPUI at Indianapolis  1. Characteristics of the Program  Academic Unit(s) Offering Program: American Studies (courses from the following departments, ANTH, COMM, ENG,  2. Rationale for the Program  The certificate in Social Justice Organizing is an 18-credit hour program for students enrolled in a degree seeking program. The certificate combines classroom instruction with practical experience in the community. The core course, American Studies A341 (designated RISE -Experiential) engages students in service learning with a local community organization or labor union. The interdisciplinary certificate draws on courses from nine different departments. Students complete at least one internship of 150 hours and may choose to do another internship or a capstone project in partnership with a local organization. The certificate is intended to give tomorrow's community leaders the knowledge and practical skills they need to build viable democratic institutions and contribute to social and economic justice. The certificate is based on the curriculum followed by students who are awarded the Sam Masarachia scholarship at IUPUI, which was established in 2001.  A certificate in Social Justice Organizing empowers students to pursue careers in non-profit management, government, education, organized labor, law, and any other field sensitive to cultural contexts. Students completing the certificate will be prepared to work with diverse communities and help people at the margins of society find a voice in the democratic process.  The Certificate in Social Justice Organizing reflects the pedagogical and intellectual characteristics of the American Studies Program. As a field, American Studies emphasizes the critical analysis of United States culture, ideas, and people. As an academic program, American Studies encourages students to apply their knowledge to practical situations through case studies and internships. Any endeavor that requires the ability to synthesize broad ideas and understand oneself in a dynamic historical context benefits from the intellectual experience of American Studies.  The certificate is consistent with the mission of the School of Liberal Arts in that fosters the exchange of knowledge that promotes understanding of the human experience. As a generator of successful interdisciplinary programs, American Studies is poised to be a key area for the school that will leverage multiple departments to bring a variety of disciplines to bear on questions and issues of social significance. Moreover, the certificate draws upon high impact practices in liberal education by integrating methodologies from the humanities and the social sciences and involving students in applied, collaborative research experiences.  The students most immediately served by this certificate are the recipients of the Sam Masarachia scholarship. Additionally, this certificate appeals to those students who want to integrate the academic study of U.S. society with direct applications for their knowledge.  The state report, Reaching Higher, Achieving More notes that the area with the greatest growth will be for those people who hold at least bachelor degrees. This program provides work-aligned curriculum for students who will have a commitment to the state and its capital city. Moreover, students with this certificate will be trained to reach out to communities most in need and in danger of falling behind in Indiana’s economy. Such students will be advocates for the kind of inclusion of all Hoosiers emphasized in the report.  Demand for labor and community organizers exists at the regional, state, and national level. The certificate is designed to make graduates competitive for entry level positions with community organizations, unions, and non-profits by combining academic knowledge with practical experience in organizing.  It might more accurate to describe the kinds of questions that graduates of this program will be able to investigate rather than the particular job tracks that they will enter. Moreover, through such questions—or the framing of problems—many present-day and future career tracks will be apparent. Graduates will be prepared to enter programs in which they can research the question of leadership in schools; the efficacy of national educational standards; the integration of living, commuting, and working in developing urban areas; the technological transformation of healthcare; the implications of “code-switching” for commerce and culture; and memorialization of communities whose identities are changing because of trends in labor, marriage, and education.  The certificate prepares students for a lifetime of active citizenship by teaching them about politics, power relationships, and the ability of average citizens to bring about social change. It also develops interpersonal skills, such as active listening and empathy, which promote healthy relationships.  According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the number of job openings for “social and community service managers” is expected to increase by 10%, which is higher than the projected overall increase of 7%. The bureau estimates that 13,200 jobs will be created in the field in the next ten years.  (Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2016-17 Edition, Social and Community Service Managers, on the Internet at http://www.bls.gov/ooh/management/social-and-community-service-managers.htm (visited May 31, 2016).  This broad category of employment includes the narrower classification “social advocacy organizations,” which more closely aligns with the curriculum of the certificate, but no data is available for this classification. As of June 1, 2016, Indeed.com lists 139 jobs for union organizers and 1294 for community organizers (http://www.indeed.com).  See Appendix 2: Summary of Indiana Department of Workforce Development and/or U.S. Department of Labor Data for additional detail.  Recent job postings reveal that opportunities exist for graduates of the program at the local, regional, and national level. The qualities sought in job applicants align closely with the student learning outcomes of the certificate. As of June 1, 2016, the Indianapolis Congregation Action Network seeks a community organizer to work on solutions to some of the city’s most pressing problems (Appendix 4A). At the regional level, the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) is looking for an internal organizer for a territory that includes Indiana and Michigan (Appendix 4B). Looking farther afield, Clean Water Action is hiring a community organizer in Philadelphia to help residents address serious threats to the local water supply. (See Appendix 4: Surveys of Employers or Students and Analyses of Job Postings for additional detail.)  3. Cost of and Support for the Program  4. Similar and Related Programs  The Community Learning Partnership works with community colleges across the country to establish certificate and degree programs in community organizing, community development, and community change. They currently have seven sites, the closest being in Detroit, at Henry Ford College. http://communitylearningpartnership.org/ The University of Iowa offers a B.A. in Social Justice. https://clas.uiowa.edu/gwss/undergraduate-program/bachelor-arts-social-justice The University of North Carolina Sociology department offers a minor in Social and Economic Justice. http://sociology.unc.edu/undergraduate-program/social-and-economic-justice-minor/  Articulation of Associate/Baccalaureate Programs  N/A Proposal is for a certificate not a B.A.  Collaboration with Similar or Related Programs on Other Campuses  None.  5. Quality and Other Aspects of the Program  The certificate requires 18 credit hours. A full-time student can complete the certificate in two years. The degree map facilitates completion in 2-4 years and specifies critical courses to be taken by particular points in time. Since 2001, thirty-nine Masarachia scholars have completed a course of study similar to the proposed certificate.  The program will not exceed 120 semester credit hours. See Appendix 11: Details Related to Exceeding the Standard Expectation of Credit Hours for additional detail.  The overall structure of the certificate is consistent with other IUPUI certificates in number of credit hours required. There is one required core course, American Studies A341: Organizing for Social Action, that provides foundational knowledge for the certificate. The certificate complies with all required academic, administrative, and procedural policies of the university.  Student Learning Outcomes (SLO) and the Principles of Undergraduate Education: The certificate addresses all of the Principles of Undergraduate Learning, with special emphasis on critical thinking, integration and application of knowledge, and ethics and values.

Capstone experience  This certificate does not prepare graduates for a license or certification .  Graduates holding the certificate will be qualified to apply for entry-level positions as community organizers or labor organizers. Although the certificate is not designed to prepare students for graduate school, several Masarachia scholars with similar academic preparation have been accepted to law school and others to graduate programs, including anthropology, urban studies, and library science. See links to resources in Appendix 2.  6. Projected Headcount, FTE Enrollments, and Degrees/Certificates Conferred  The Masarachia Scholars Program supports twelve students per year, all of whom will be enrolled in the certificate. Over the course of sixteen years, the program has produced thirty-nine graduates with credentials entitling them to the proposed certificate. No one can predict the future, but three additional certificate students the first year, five the second, and seven in the third year seem like reasonable estimates.

The main focus of CWA’s state campaigns is to stop Marcellus Shale natural gas drilling from contaminating our water resources.  Responsibilities:  Qualifications:  TO APPLY: Send your resume to Steve Hvozdovich, PA Campaigns Director, Clean Water Action, 100 Fifth Ave., #1108, Pittsburgh, PA 15222 or email to shvozdovich@cleanwater.org. Application taken until position filled.   ### Appendix 5: Letters of Support  February 26, 2017  To Whom it May Concern,  I write this letter to show my support for the proposed certificate in social justice organizing at IUPUI. I am a community organizer who has been doing social justice work in Indianapolis since 2008. When I first moved here from Chicago to start a program for the American Friends Service Committee, I learned about the Masarachia Scholars very quickly from other organizers who had worked with these very talented and prepared students. The proposed certificate in social justice organizing would give these students and others a credential that would qualify them for entry-level positions with non-profit organizations.  I have had the privilege of working with many of these students as interns and volunteers for my programs. Their knowledge of community organizing practices and theories is greatly appreciated and adds so much value to the work we do. In my work, I focus a lot of efforts on narrative change and creating messages for the media that frame our issues and the change we seek in an effective way to change people’s hearts and minds. It has been very fulfilling to do this kind of work with Masarachia Scholars who each have a deep commitment of social justice issues and a commitment to do the work necessary to achieve justice for all.  I also had the privilege in participating in an evaluation of the organizing class taught by Tom Marvin. The process of consulting community organizers who have engaged with the program was very thoughtful and it has been refreshing to see the suggestions we made implemented in the program.  In these times when so many of our rights are being attacked and it is more important than ever to organize for social justice, I so appreciate this program and the great work it does to train up the next generation of leaders in our community.  Thank you for your consideration, Erin Polley Program Coordinator American Friends Service Committee  March 1, 2017  To Whom It May Concern: It is my great pleasure to offer this letter of support for the Social Justice Certificate program at IUPUI.  First, please allow me to outline my experience with IUPUI and the Masarachia Program. I was a member of the Masarachia Board for approximately ten years, first as a non-tenured faculty member of the Division of Labor Studies and later, after I left the university, as a community member. IUPUI is also my alma mater.  I left the university to take a position as Partnership Development Coordinator with the regional office of the Laborers International Union of North America. One of my core duties in this position is directing the Partnership Development Program for Indiana. This includes hiring and managing a staff of seven to twelve Partnership Development Representatives (PDR) throughout the state. In years past, our program would have been known as the Organizing Department and the PDRs as Organizers.  While at IUPUI, I had the opportunity to employ one of the Masarachia Scholarship students, Desiree Handley, as a research assistant for two years. Simply put, she was outstanding.  In my current position, I also interact professionally on a regular basis with a Masarachia Scholarship graduate who now works for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), Region 25. I knew her as a student when I served on the Masarachia Board and now know her in her professional capacity as an NLRB attorney. Her name is Caridad Austin. Once again, she is simply outstanding.  Over the years, I have found all of the Masarachia Scholars to be exceptionally well prepared as well as quite passionate about the work they do.  I can say without hesitation or qualification that the idea of students receiving a certificate in Social Justice is extremely appealing to those of us who engage in hiring for union staff positions. We are continually searching for that special mix of skills and education as well as a deeper understanding and passion for the work we do. I believe a certificate in Social Justice would greatly enhance the qualifications people like me seek in potential job candidates. I am excited by the prospect of having a pool of well-prepared candidates from which to potentially hire new staff.  In closing, please allow me to reiterate - I strongly support and greatly welcome the creation of the Social Justice Certificate program and look forward to seeing its graduates apply for positions with my organization.  Sincerely, David Williams Partnership Development Coordinator  Midwest Region, Laborers International Union of North America  March 8, 2017  To Whom It May Concern:  This letter is to provide support for the Certificate in Social Justice Organizing at IUPUI. As an employer located in Indianapolis, we believe it is important that graduates are prepared for entry-level positions in community organizations. As evidence, I required one of my new employees with a Bachelor’s Degree to participate in one of the courses offered here at the MLK Center by Professor Tom Marvin.  Over the years, I have supervised numerous students completing their internship requirement for the Masarachia Scholarship program. The scholars complete the course work included in this Social Justice Organizing Certificate, and they hold a different skill set, and were more prepared than interns from other disciplines.  I obtainedmyMastersinSocialWorkfromIUPUI in2000, and identified social change as my passion while in the second year of my program. It has taken years to obtain the professional development that this Certificate includes. This is a valuable opportunity for future graduates with any degree.  If you need any additional information, I can be reached at Allison@MLKCenterIndy.org or 317-923- 4581. Thank you for considering this opportunity for students.  Peace and Grace,  Allison Luthe, MSW ‘00 Executive Director   ### Appendix 6: Faculty and Staff   #### Current faculty:  No new faculty positions are needed.   ### Appendix 7: Facilities  No new space is needed.   ### Appendix 8: Other Capital Costs  No additional resources are required.   ### Appendix 9: Articulation of Associate/Baccalaureate Programs  N/A   ### Appendix 10: Credit Hours Required/Time to Completion  18 total credits (typical of current certificates).

Fall 2016  Tom Marvin Office: Cavanaugh 501J Hours: Tuesday & Thursday 12-1:15 and by appointment. Phone & Voice Mail: 274-9844 / Fax: 274-2347 E-mail address: tmarvin1@iupui.edu  In this course we will study the social movements of the past and meet the activists who are working for social justice today. We will learn about the history of American protest in order to understand how mass organizations are created and how they can be used to realize the American ideals of liberty, equality, justice, peace, and opportunity for all. Originally designed as the centerpiece for the first year of the Sam Masarachia Scholars Program, this seminar is now open to anyone interested in social-action organizing.  Emphasis throughout is on bridging the academic perspective of the classroom with the practical concerns of different communities. We will enjoy frequent visits from labor and community organizers, and students will be encouraged to attend a wide range of events and participate in a service-learning project to experience the connections between assigned readings and the practice of organizing.  Our central question will be: what can the social-action organizations of the past and present teach us about the possibilities for progressive social change in our world today?  OBJECTIVES: This course is designed to help students achieve the goals outlined in IUPUI’s Principles of Undergraduate Learning, with special emphasis on:  EVALUATION: You will earn your grade by accumulating points for completing various learning opportunities -- some of them required (*) and others optional. This system provides you with flexibility, so you can customize the course to fit your goals and learning style, but it also requires responsibility and discipline to earn enough points for a good grade. You will develop a learning plan early in the semester and keep track of your progress by tallying the points you earn.  N.B. To remain in the course, you must earn at least 20 points by the end of week three and 40 by the end of week five.  There are five different ways to earn points (refer to canvas for detailed instructions):  Ungraded Learning Opportunities (you do the work you get the points):  *Weekly Forum Posts: Earn up to 20 points per week by participating in an online discussion. Each post, consisting of 100 words plus one discussion question, is worth 5 points. Maximum of four per week for credit. Minimum of eight per semester and four in the first three weeks. 260 total points possible.  *In-class discussion leaders: Let me know the day before if you would like to help lead our discussion of the assigned reading. Discussion leaders earn 30 points by formulating at least three questions designed to provoke analysis and leading the class discussion for about 10-15 minutes. Maximum of five, minimum of one for 150 possible points.  Graded Learning Opportunities (points depend on performance):  Service learning: If you decide to do a service-learning project, you will work with a labor or community organization and reflect on how the experience has contributed to your understanding of course themes. I will provide a list of servicelearning opportunities, and invite representatives of the organizations to visit the class. The project will begin with a contract , signed by you and by your supervisor at the organization and due September 14. The contract will specify your work hours (usually 3-4 per week for 8-10 weeks) and the duties you will perform. These duties must be directly related to the mission of the organization and the goals of this class. Routine office work (typing, filing, etc.) is not appropriate for a service-learning project. You will complete two service journals (50 points each), which link your service experiences with course themes and issues. Service journals should be a minimum of 500 words, but more information is welcome. The week of December 7, you will give a brief oral report (50 points) on how your experience relates to the course. A final reflective paper (5-7 pages, worth up to 100 points) will summarize what you have learned about organizing by completing the service-learning project (250 possible points).  Event reports: Attend a rally, march, or meeting of a social-justice organization and write a 500-word description and analysis. Event reports may not overlap with service learning, so if you’re doing service learning with the Sierra Club, you can’t also report on one of their events, but you may report on a Jobs with Justice, UNITE/HERE, or other social justice event. Earn up to 25 points for each report and an additional 5 points for an oral report in class (maximum of three event reports for 90 possible points). I’ll notify you in class and via canvas when I hear of an appropriate event and please do the same for the rest of us.  Issue papers of 1200-1500 words deal with a specific, controversial issue in organizing or working class history (maximum of two, up to 100 points each, 200 possible points).  Class Project: If there is sufficient interest, we will collaborate on a research/action project on a topic to be determined collectively, so that we can apply what we’re learning about organizing to a real-life situation. Everyone will be required to read about the issue, discuss it in class, and help us come up with a strategy for the campaign. Those who are interested can conduct research, organize events, and write op-ed pieces about the issue to earn points. Specific opportunities will emerge as the project develops.  Create your own learning opportunity: If you’re already working on a social justice issue, you can get credit for it by writing it up as if it were service learning. Or maybe you can think of an activity that will improve your organizing skills and knowledge that isn’t listed. Give me a brief written or oral proposal, and we’ll work out the points.  Points required for final grades: 520=A 500=A- 480=B+ 460=B 440=B- 420=C+ 380=C 360=C- 340=D.  ATTENDANCE: Faithful attendance and active participation are vital to your success in this course. However, since emergencies plague even the most diligent, students are permitted to miss three classes without penalty, no questions asked or excuses required. Each subsequent absence will cost you ten points. Students who miss more than seven classes receive an automatic F for the course.  GRADING STANDARDS and POINT SCALE:  A WARNING ABOUT PLAGIARISM: According to the Indiana University Bulletin: “Plagiarism is the offering of the work of someone else as one’s own. Honesty requires that any ideas or materials taken from another source for either written or oral use must be fully acknowledged.” For further information on plagiarism, refer to the IU Code of Student Ethics.  Students needing accommodations because of disability will need to register with Adaptive Educational Services and complete the appropriate forms issued by AES before accommodations will be given. The AES office is located in Taylor Hall, UC 100. You can also reach the office by calling 274-3241.  Even the best writers receive help, and one resource available to student writers at IUPUI is the University Writing Center . Appointments can be made with consultants to go over papers at any point in the writing process. Appointments are generally 45 minutes each and need to be made ahead of time (generally for a day or so from when you call or visit). To schedule a session, call 274-2049 or visit the UWC website at http://liberalarts.iupui.edu/ uwc/  [http://liberalarts.iupui.edu/ uwc/](http://liberalarts.iupui.edu/uwc/)  REQUIRED BOOKS:  Recommended:  A Note on the Schedule: Each week has a theme in boldface and a set of readings that must be completed before class on Tuesday, so Thursdays do not appear on the schedule unless an assignment is due, but we still have class!   ### SCHEDULE  The schedule is likely to change to accommodate our guest speakers. If you miss a class, check canvas for updates, including additional readings.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=0WEeVGSz-qo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WEeVGSz-qo)  [http://www.yourmorals.org/](http://www.yourmorals.org/)  [http://www.politicalcompass. org/](http://www.politicalcompass.org/)   ## Service Learning Journals  The service learning journals give you an opportunity to describe your service learning experiences and link them with course themes and issues. Each service-learning journal must be a minimum of 500 words, typed, and double spaced, but more information and reflection is welcome. Your grade will be based on the thoroughness of your descriptions and your ability to link them with significant issues in the theory and practice of organizing. The following prompts may help you to put together a good service-learning journal. Depending on the organization, some will be more important than others. Ignore those that don’t apply.  1. What have you been doing for the organization? Describe specific duties and outcomes.  2. How does your work contribute to the goals of the organization?  3. What have you learned about how the organization operates?  4. Have you encountered any problems? If so, describe the problem in detail and discuss what you have done in response, or what you plan to do.  5. How has your service learning experience helped you to better understand a specific issue or issues faced by organizers today?   ## Service-Learning Reflective Paper Guidelines  Purpose: The reflective paper provides you with an opportunity to look back on your service experience and think about what you learned about yourself, the organization, and organizing in general. The clarity and comprehensiveness of your report will be judged to determine your grade for this assignment. For more information on grading standards, consult the grading rubric in the syllabus.  Audience: The primary audience for the paper consists of the members of the class and the instructor. Particularly effective papers may also be used as models for subsequent classes and/or distributed to IUPUI’s Center for Service and Learning. Papers will be made available to sponsoring organizations only if they have asked for a copy and you have given your approval because it is important for you to feel free to criticize the organization.  Suggestions: Any piece of writing should begin with a clear understanding of its purpose and audience, and every decision during the writing process should be based on achieving the stated purpose for the intended audience.  Thoroughly answering the following questions should help you to produce a good reflective paper, but more may be needed depending on your experiences, and all questions will not be relevant to all situations. Use your judgment based on your understanding of purpose and audience. Give concrete examples to back up any general claims.  1. What is the purpose of the organization? What population does it serve? 2. What structures are in place to help it achieve its purpose? (If your service brought you into contact with only a part of the organization’s structure, describe that part.) 3. What did you do for the organization? 4. How did your service help the organization achieve its goals? 5. How effective do you think the organization is in achieving these goals? 6. What could the organization do differently to improve its performance? 7. What connections can you make between the organization and the history and theory of organizing for social change that we have studied this semester? 8. What, if anything, have you learned about yourself as a result of this experience?  Format:  The paper should be double-spaced, 12 point standard font, one-inch margins all around, and 5-7 pages in length. Append your previous service learning journals to the back of your report. Please do not use a cover or even a cover sheet. Just staple the pages together.   ## A341: EVALUATION GRID FOR THE SERVICE LEARNING REFLECTION   # Sam Masarachia Scholars Program Internships   ## May 2016  The Masarachia Program is both a scholarship and a path to study and activism. It engages students at IUPUI in study and experience built around organizing and the representation of workers, seniors, and communities. The program emphasizes the concerns of social action and social justice and the “peoples’ organizations” involved in these pursuits. It addresses power and change. As such the Masarachia Program is distinct from programs associated more broadly with non-profit organizations, philanthropy, service, and service learning.  Organizing for social action is not learned in the classroom alone. It requires real world engagement in the conflicts that bring people together. Effective social action grows from the combination of theory and practice. Accordingly, the internship component of the Masarachia Program is one effort to involve participants in the work of social change.  The intent of the Masarachia internship program is to expose participants to a variety of facets of the sponsoring organization’s work in such a way as to learn about the work and inform career choices, but also to contribute to the work of the organization. This may occasionally involve licking a few stamps or answering phones, but is principally about assisting with the tasks of organizing and representation.  What internship opportunities are available? We work primarily with labor and social action organizations in the Indianapolis area. Many of these organizations have representatives who meet with introductory or advanced seminars, serve on the Masarachia Board, or are otherwise involved with the Program. This affords students opportunities to learn about their work before making internship decisions. The relationship also helps those in other organizations understand the unique aspects of the Masarachia Program, thus easing coordination with intern supervisors. Of the two internships, one should be with a labor union, the second with either a senior or community organization engaged in social action or with a second union. In the latter case, if the first internship is with a building trades union, the second should be with a non-building trades union.  Are there exclusions? Yes. Internships should not be with one’s “home” organization or one in which a close family member is engaged. Nor do political candidate campaigns ordinarily qualify. The same goes for “social production” organizations, those emphasizing individual service and the provision of goods and services. Also, occasional exceptions to the “Indianapolis area” expectation may be made, but only with organizations that have a proven record of successful work with student interns.  What is the time commitment? Interns are expected to work a total of 150 hours. Over the course of a 15 week semester that would be 8 to 10 hours per week. Summer internships often allow scholars to devote more hours per week and thus finish the internship sooner. Hours should ordinarily be concentrated rather than spread out in small amounts over a week. Most tasks should be supervised, at least on a regular check-in basis on the premises of the sponsoring organization. Interns need to recognize that organizing is not a 9 -5 job, and that they must be flexible about hours if they are to contribute meaningfully to the work of the sponsoring organization.  Can interns accept pay? Not for the internship hours. However some organizations would like to hire interns, in which case the additional work can be compensated as long as the first hours are performed without compensation for the internship.  Is there academic credit involved? This is up to you. Credit is typically arranged through the student’s major department under an internship or experience course number. Course obligations are similarly arranged through the department, with requirements for journals and submissions handled with the supervising faculty member. If you want to receive credit for an internship, you must get it approved by a faculty member BEFORE you begin. Fill out an “Internship Proposal Form,” available from the Masarachia Oncourse site, and get it approved by a faculty member in your major department or another appropriate department.  Even if you choose not to do the internship for academic credit, you must complete the following assignments and submit them to the Masarachia director in order to complete the internship requirement of the program.  How do I get started?  How should I document my internship experience?   ### THE JOURNAL  Throughout your internship you must keep a journal your activities. The journal is intended to help you write the final report at the end of the internship. A few minutes spent journaling each week will save you hours at the end of the internship, so don’t neglect the journal. Follow these guidelines and submit your journal to the Masarachia director via e-mail every other week during your internship.   ### THE FINAL REPORT  Within one month of completing the internship, you must submit a final report of 8- 10 typed pages summarizing the work you performed, what you learned from it, and how the internship experience helped you achieve the goals of the Masarachia Program. Don’t fail to mention any problems you encountered and describe how you dealt with them. Model internship reports are available on the Masarachia oncourse site. An effective report should answer the following questions:  What to do if problems arise? This happens occasionally. Get in touch with the Masarachia contact immediately. Don’t let a problem fester.  Are there guidelines concerning confidentiality? All organizations have internal politics, face problems, and operate at something less than maximum efficiency. Interns are expected to discuss organizational experiences in academic settings, notably in Masarachia seminars, as appropriate. This is different from putting that organization’s internal business “on the street.” Questions should be raised with intern supervisors or the Masarachia director or coordinator.  Appendix 11: Details Related to Exceeding the Standard Expectation of Credit Hours  The program will not exceed 120 semester credit hours. "

Muslim and Christian youth documenting each other's faith communities through a joint photography exhibit. A Holocaust museum conducting Islamophobia workshops for students. An original children's play based on Muslim folklore. Muslim youth learning how to confront anti-Muslim bias.  Those are five projects that could help prevent Islamophobia in greater Indianapolis, and they will all come to life thanks to a competition sponsored by Edward Curtis, Millennium Chair of the Liberal Arts at the Indiana University School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI.  Community activists, artists, teachers and anyone else hoping to combat anti-Muslim prejudice were encouraged to submit applications during the summer, with the best ideas receiving a $1,000 prize from the Millennium Chair's research budget. IUPUI students and employees were not eligible.  \"I love these creative projects,\" Curtis said. \"We got very optimistic, forward-focused projects on Indianapolis youth. This focus indicates just how hopeful community leaders are that the next generation can help reduce anti-Muslim discrimination and bias.\"  Curtis selected the projects after receiving input from fellow School of Liberal Arts faculty Modupe Labode, associate professor of history and museum studies, and Amira Mashhour, lecturer and director of the Arabic program.  Winners are expected to implement their projects by May 2018.  The five winners are: "

    "body": "  # IUPUI in pilot program to validate employability of graduates  Friday, March 16, 2018  INDIANAPOLIS -- In an ever-changing employment world, does a college degree fully prepare newcomers to the workforce?  IUPUI is joining 27 other higher education programs across North America working to find out. As participants in the Essential Employability Qualities (EEQ) Pilot led by The Quality Assurance (QA) Commons for Higher and Postsecondary Education, they are co-designing ways to assess and affirm higher education programs that intentionally:  According to a 2015 Gallup-Purdue Index report, while 98 percent of chief academic officers rate their institutions as very or somewhat effective at preparing students for the employment world, only 11 percent of business leaders strongly agree that graduating students have the necessary skills and competencies.  \"That gap is large enough to show there's a serious issue about communication on what graduates should be able to do,\" said Bill Plater, senior scholar at the QA Commons and executive vice chancellor and dean of the faculties emeritus at IUPUI. \"We've been talking to many employers, and almost every one of them has a set of expectations of what employees need to do to be successful. Employers are great at looking at the specific skill a person needs in the field of work, but what they don't really know how to do well is assess things like critical thinking, communications skills and problem solving.\"  Many employers and their respective professional associations often specify the so-called soft skills that most colleges and universities say they provide, often using the same words to describe the qualities employers seek, but there is little agreement on what the terms actually mean -- and what evidence of attainment is acceptable. The QA Commons is developing standards and processes to certify that a program or department actually prepares all of its graduates with the qualities that employers really want. Employers can then rely on a certified program’s claim that its graduates have acquired the essential skills.  The nature of work in many fields has changed dramatically in the last few decades. For example, technology has changed manufacturing jobs from human assembly line work to automated work, requiring employees to think differently about the manufacturing process. An aging workforce in some areas also has altered the employment landscape.  The essential employability qualities that EEQ Pilot participants seek to develop in graduates include:  At IUPUI, bachelor of arts programs in philanthropic studies in the IU Lilly Family School of Philanthropy as well as IU School of Liberal Arts programs in English and Paralegal Studies Program including the law in liberal arts bachelor’s degree and paralegal studies certificate are participating in the pilot.  \"It's a way to develop a common language. Our language in academia doesn't necessarily match up with an employer's language,\" said Erin Engels, director of the paralegal studies program and an assistant clinical professor in political science in the School of Liberal Arts. \"We need to communicate to students too -- you're not just learning about the history of politics and how people interact in government, we're helping you navigate the politics of the workplace.\"  Pilot participants met in September to work on a yearlong plan. Participants represent a range of disciplines, learning formats and degree levels, and include public, private, for-profit and faith-based institutions.  \"We all benefit by participating because we'll get ideas from other programs and resources to help our students,\" said Steve Fox, director of writing and associate professor of English in the School of Liberal Arts. \"What we want to do is ultimately help our students be employable when they graduate and be able to improve communication with employers, so there's good feedback among all these parties.\"  The QA Commons and the EEQ Pilot are funded through the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems, under a grant from Indianapolis-based Lumina Foundation.

    "body": "  # IUPUI student literary magazine named best in Indiana for second year  Wednesday, April 18, 2018  The IUPUI student literary magazine, “genesis,” published by the Department of English in the IU School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI, is celebrating its 45th anniversary with special recognition. The Indiana College Press Association (ICPA) has named them the Best Literary Magazine for the second straight year.  IUPUI students have been submitting their short stories, poetry, and artwork to the magazine since 1973, a year after it was founded by former faculty Rebecca Pitts (English) and Laurence Lampert (philosophy). While the shape and size of the magazine has changed over the years, IUPUI students continue to create high-quality content.  “You can tell that IUPUI students put their hearts into what they do, and it reflects in their work,” says Caroline Niepokoj, a student managing editor for the magazine. “The students don’t seem afraid to tackle big, serious concepts, and in ways that make you think about your own views. Getting your point across in a creative way is something all writers and artists try to do, and I think IUPUI students do a good job at this.”  Each year the ICPA celebrates the best in college journalism and creative writing with over 30 universities competing. The best literary magazine was determined by a point system with “genesis” finishing first place overall after being judge in categories that included best short story, best creative nonfiction, best short poem and best free verse poem, best hand drawn illustration, and best overall design. The “genesis” staff is made up of students who must take one creative writing class followed by a class focused on literary editing and publishing.  “Every semester, editors volunteer around 20-30 hours of their time reading and critiquing submissions, writing feedback letters, and designing and promoting the journal,” says Ashley Williams, another student managing editor. “Not only does winning the award prove that IUPUI has talented students, but it also proves that our volunteer work has paid off.”  “I hope [the student editors] feel enormous pride, as I do, in their accomplishment,” says Sarah Layden, English professor in the School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI and “genesis” faculty advisor. “They've spent time, energy and effort in order to create an issue each semester, which is no small undertaking when you consider their busy lives. While it's great to be recognized for a job well done, it's also worth noting that the students are developing skills they can use in any job: communication and negotiation are part of the editorial meetings, and making a magazine allows them to think critically and creatively at the same time.”  The literary magazine is currently celebrating its anniversary with a month-long art exhibit housed in the Campus Center Cultural Arts Gallery. The Spring 2018 issue will launch Thursday, April 19, with a release party in the Campus Center Theater Level at 1:30 p.m. The release party will feature snacks and a student reading of published work.

Thursday, September 13, 2018  The IU School of Liberal Arts’ Residential-Based Learning Community hosted an ice cream social on Thursday, Sept. 6, that brought 131 students, faculty, and staff out to the dorm for a celebration of the start of the new school year. Located in North Hall, this was the second consecutive ice cream social and marked the beginning of the learning community’s second year. Last year, the event was held alongside a ribbon cutting ceremony to welcome the new liberal arts community to campus. Interim School of Liberal Arts dean Robert Rebein was on hand  to meet and talk with students living in the community. Focused on civic engagement, liberal arts majors living in North Hall have the opportunity to not only participate in social activities but work directly with faculty on research, service projects, and scholarship opportunities. They can also take courses connected to the learning community and have easy access to internships and additional learning experiences in downtown Indianapolis. The community is open to all liberal arts majors, though freshmen are encouraged to participate in the IUPUI Summer Bridge or TLC program before the school year begins.  Students can apply for 2019-20 housing in the Liberal Arts Community here.

    "body": "  # New Ph.D. program in American studies looks to prepare students for careers in the community  Thursday, July 27, 2017  INDIANAPOLIS -- The city of Indianapolis, like many big urban cities, has flourishing arts and cultural organizations. But how do they change communities? Do they enhance lives? Can their effects be measured beyond simple metrics such as attendance counts and numbers of art installations?  Students in a new Ph.D. program at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis will strive to find the answers while working directly with community partners.  The IUPUI Arts and Humanities Institute is teaming up with American studies in the School of Liberal Arts to offer a new Ph.D. in American studies, with a track in cultural ecologies, beginning this fall.  Cultural ecologies is an applied program that supports the community by embedding students in cultural organizations while preparing them for jobs in the cultural sector.  \"We're in a moment when academia is in a rapid transformation, which presents challenges and opportunities at the same time. The opportunities include new ways to think about how we can create a high-level Ph.D. education,\" said Jason M. Kelly, director of the institute. \"We're focused on creating an applied Ph.D. program from the ground up, one in which our students are preparing for careers outside academia.  \"We want this to be a resource for communities -- to make Indianapolis a stronger, more vibrant city and to help train the next generation of the city's leaders.\"  The Ph.D. track has three components: coursework, an internship and a dissertation. The coursework is interdisciplinary and focused on both qualitative and quantitative methods. The centerpiece of the program is a multiyear internship in a Central Indiana cultural organization, where students will help solve a complex problem that the institution faces. This internship experience will provide the core research for the dissertation, a major work of scholarship.  While in the program, students will be affiliated with the IUPUI Arts and Humanities Institute and participate in its Cultural Ecologies Project, which asks the question \"How do arts and humanities interventions transform cities?\" Working with numerous community partners including the Arts Council of Indianapolis, Musical Family Tree and the House Life Project, this research project examines the impact of the arts and humanities across multiple scales, from the personal to the neighborhood to the city level.  \"We have all these organizations doing amazing work, but our understanding of how they're affecting communities across the city is limited,\" Kelly said. \"We might be able to collect basic data like how many people attend events or how the tax base near a cultural institution is changing, but we're not necessarily getting at deeper, long-term changes that are difficult to measure numerically.  \"Cultural ecologies can help make Indianapolis a stronger place for arts and culture by providing information to organizations so they can responsively adapt their programming and demonstrate the many ways they benefit communities,\" he continued. \"This program has emerged from years of conversations with cultural partners -- broader assessment of impacts are a challenge they all face, especially when many are understaffed and under-resourced.\"  The Ph.D. program in American studies is one of five new Ph.D. programs at IUPUI approved by the Indiana Commission on Higher Education in 2016. Students with bachelor's degrees are eligible to apply, and those with advanced professional degrees, such as MAs, MBAs, JDs, and Ed.D.s are especially encouraged. To learn more about the project and the Ph.D. track, visit the Cultural Ecologies Project website. "

[Arts Journalism Fellowship](https://indyarts.org/grants/grants-for-individuals/arts-journalism-fellowship)  [Arts Council of Indianapolis](https://indyarts.org/)  [NUVO](https://www.nuvo.net/)  \"I applied [for the fellowship] because I saw it as an opportunity to expand my knowledge of the Indianapolis arts scene beyond our great music, as well as a chance to work with a really great and experienced staff,\" said Cooper. \"I've covered the Indy music scene from the time that I joined The Campus Citizen [IUPUI's independent, student-run online news publication], and I love speaking with all the local artists, venue staff and festival organizers that share their talents and passions with our city.\"  [The Campus Citizen](http://thecampuscitizen.com/)  After applying, Cooper went through an interview process. \"I was really nervous before and during the interview, and I felt both surprised and honored to be chosen to participate in the fellowship,\" she said. \"I was really excited.\"  The fellowship began in August and will run through May 2018. According to the Arts Council of Indianapolis website, the Arts Journalism Fellowship Program is a partnership with the Arts Council of Indianapolis and media partners The Indianapolis Star (IndyStar) and NUVO to promote and increase arts coverage. The fellowship program seeks to introduce and provide students with connections, and to build relationships with professional journalists and artists in central Indiana, the site says.  The council also awarded a fellowship to Susie Schmank, who is working for IndyStar.  Cooper works at NUVO about 10 hours per week. \"I work with the arts editor, Dan Grossman, very closely, and it is a balance of him assigning stories and pieces that I pitch,\" she said. \"On Wednesdays, I am able to sit in on editors' meetings, which I enjoy very much, because it allows me to see how the staff works together to put out a weekly issue.\"  Cooper is also the editor of the Campus Citizen this year. \"Classes, the fellowship and the Campus Citizen is definitely a difficult balancing act, at times,\" said Cooper. \"I didn't plan it this way, but I don't have classes on Mondays and Wednesdays, so I'm not rushing to get to class after I leave NUVO. In terms of The Citizen, every member of the editorial staff helps me greatly to keep everything straight. I'm very thankful to work with such a dedicated staff.\"  [the Campus Citizen](http://thecampuscitizen.com/)  Are you interested in this fellowship? The 2018 fellowship term runs from August 2018 to May 2019. For more details, visit https://indyarts.org/grants/grants-for-individuals/arts-journalism-fellowship .

    "body": "  ## Promotion Criteria for Lecturer Ranks  Promotion Criteria for the Lecturer Ranks (PDF Version for download)  This document outlines the IU School of Liberal Arts’ criteria for promotion within the lecturer ranks. A candidate for promotion either from Lecturer to Senior Lecturer or from Senior Lecturer to Teaching Professor will be evaluated by the school criteria set forth below, as well as the more general criteria provided in the IUPUI Guidelines for Preparing and Reviewing Promotion and Tenure Dossiers and the more specific criteria approved by the candidate’s department. Promotion is a recognition of past achievement and a sign of confidence that the individual is capable of greater responsibilities and accomplishments. The candidate seeking promotion in the lecturer ranks is required to show a record that is excellent in teaching and satisfactory in service. In accordance with university and campus policy, evaluation of a candidate’s record will take into account the mission of the candidate’s unit and the particular contributions to that mission that are expected of the candidate. Promotion to Senior Lecturer is normally considered during the sixth year in rank as Lecturer, but promotion may be sought sooner or later than this time frame. Promotion to Teaching Professor may be sought at any time by a Senior Lecturer; as promotion is based on work done in rank, five years is the common (but not required) minimum length of time before advancement(1). One or more teaching related activities or achievements, properly documented(2), are expected when making the case for excellence in teaching, in conjunction with the specific criteria outlined below for each promotion rank. For promotion to both Senior Lecturer and Teaching Professor these activities/achievements may include, but are not limited to: important contributions to the curriculum of the department, school, or campus; notable contributions in advising and mentoring; effective pedagogical innovations, including the effective use of technology; leadership in teaching; demonstrated impact on former students; significant participation in teaching workshops, panels, and conferences; the securing of, or participation in, grants for teaching-related projects; contribution to the success and retention of first-year students; outreach and impact on K-12 education; outreach to adult learners; contributions to the documentation and assessment of student learning; and/or pedagogical or disciplinary research or creative activity and its publication, presentation, or application in support of teaching.  Criteria for Promotion to Senior Lecturer Excellent Performance in Teaching. In demonstrating teaching excellence, candidates must show convincing evidence that their performance in the classroom has been of high quality, as judged by departmental standards and evaluated in peer reviews, and that they have made important and documented contributions to student learning at the school and/or campus levels. Candidates must also show evidence of having shared teaching related ideas and/or activities locally or internally through administration, mentoring, publication, presentation or other means. Candidates are also required to provide: a teaching philosophy that is informed by best practices and is reflective in nature, clearly showing continuous efforts to grow and improve professionally as a teacher; documentation of one or more influential and effective teaching-related activities/achievements (see above). Satisfactory Performance in Service: In demonstrating satisfactory service, the candidate must show convincing evidence that the candidate’s service to the program, department, and/or school has been satisfactory in quality as well as in quantity. Service may include, but is not limited to, professional and university service, committee membership, and community work directly related to the candidate’s disciplinary expertise.   ### Criteria for Promotion to Teaching Professor  Excellent Performance in Teaching. Including the criteria outlined for promotion to Senior Lecturer, those seeking promotion to the rank of Teaching Professor also must successfully document: • an ongoing commitment to highly effective, high-impact teaching practices and important contributions to student learning, whether in the classroom, online, or other instructional contexts. • a record of positive contributions over several years to the teaching mission of the unit, campus, or university that is broad in scope, such as the advising and/or mentoring of students. • a sustained commitment to professional development and pedagogical excellence, which is often documented by teaching or other appropriate awards, memberships in teaching colloquia, and/or fellowships (e.g., FACET or Mosaic). • a record of disseminated scholarly work through administration, mentoring, publication, presentation or other means not only at the school and/or campus level but typically (although not necessarily) also beyond the campus – in local/regional/national professional organizations, the community and/or Indiana University. Some form of peer review needs to be part of the documentation of scholarly work in teaching for promotion to Teaching Professor. Satisfactory Performance in Service. The candidate must document a record of departmental, school, and/or campus committee involvement; some participation in professional organizations and/or service to outside groups is also expected. ----------------------------------------------------------------- NOTES : (1) For a transition period through 2023-2024, each promotion case will be examined for a sustained record of excellence, regardless of the exact rank held at the time. (2) Proper documentation of effective teaching practices and contributions to student learning is required in order to show excellence in teaching. See Appendix for recommendations on the types of evidence that are most informative.   ### Appendix  Approved by Faculty Assembly March 6th, 2020. "

    "body": "  # Liberal Arts Statement Against Violence  Monday, June 01, 2020  Dear Liberal Arts community,  Like many of you, the actions caught on video during the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis have sickened and dismayed me. And this is just the latest example of institutional and systemic structural violence against people of color in our nation; previous examples include Dreasjon Reed, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and so many more. In the IU School of Liberal Arts, we denounce racism, hate, and bigotry in all its forms. We especially denounce police brutality because it undermines our belief in a society built on the values of respect and dignity for all people. In this, our values are in line with those expressed by Chancellor Paydar in his May 30 message to the IUPUI community. At times like this, it is important that we stand together in unity and show that it is not just abstract principles like justice and fairness for all that we support. We also support and express solidarity with our Black faculty, staff, students, and community partners who are hurting right now and who, like all people, have a right to feel safe inside and outside of their communities and to see their rights as citizens protected. As a school, we have made important strides in the past couple of years in the areas of diversity, equity, and inclusion–from our vote to institute a standing Diversity and Inclusion Committee that would hold us accountable for the diversity goals we set for ourselves, to the development of a new Pathways Minor that addresses issues on diversity, inclusion, and social justice. We remain firmly grounded in the mission and vision of the School of Liberal Arts Diversity Statement:  [May 30 message](http://click.e.iu.edu/?qs=acf3aa3e4baa69b9a7c088b79b5a40e7d7aedcc081b037852ad0af7fa8c4ad355e7fc9d959ff8b6f76774484edf421b7)  Mission – In our school, we believe that educational excellence is directly tied to our ability to create a diverse, inclusive, and equitable community. We promote inclusive values through scholarship, teaching, service, and community engagement. We are committed to an ongoing inclusive climate based on mutual respect, appreciation of others, open-mindedness, and free inquiry.  Vision – Our vision is to create and uphold models of diversity, inclusion, and equity on our campus and beyond. We are committed to the principles of diversity, inclusion, and equity for all.  As the nation and world respond to the recent inhumane activities, we are forced to not only reflect on the barriers faced by our minoritized and underserved constituents but also to consider the work that needs to be done and the actions we need to take to ensure equity. As Dean, I am committed to working with you to collectively support our Diversity and Inclusion Committee to achieve the diversity goals outlined in our recently approved diversity statement.  I ask you to join me in condemning systemic violence and seeking answers to this and other problems we face as a school, a community, and a nation. Sincerely yours, Robert Rebein Interim Dean "

Plater Faculty Chair of Liberal Arts  Friday, July 30, 2021  When “The Millennium Chair” was established, the donors, Bill and Gail Plater, worked at IUPUI and wished their gift to be known as the Millennium Chair until long after they’d retired. The time has come to acknowledge their generosity by allowing this endowed chair to be known as the “William M. and Gail M. Plater Faculty Chair of Liberal Arts.”  When “The Millennium Chair” was established, the donors, Bill and Gail Plater, worked at IUPUI and wished their gift to be known as the Millennium Chair until long after they’d retired. The time has come to acknowledge their generosity by allowing this endowed chair to be known as the “William M. and Gail M. Plater Faculty Chair of Liberal Arts.”  Read Story  When “The Millennium Chair” was established, the donors, Bill and Gail Plater, worked at IUPUI and wished their gift to be known as the Millennium Chair until long after they’d retired. The time has come to acknowledge their generosity by allowing this endowed chair to be known as the “William M. and Gail M. Plater Faculty Chair of Liberal Arts.”  The Platers have long believed that IUPUI is uniquely poised among urban campuses in the country to make substantive contributions in higher education. New technologies and pedagogies, as yet undiscovered, have the greatest chance for development and practice in this environment. Bill and Gail believe that the future of education, at all levels, lies in the institution’s willingness to experiment with new ways of approaching traditional subjects, as well as discovering new areas of study through an interdisciplinary approach and connecting learning with the life of the community.  The first holder of the chair was Anthony “Tony” Sherrill, professor of Religious Studies and director of the Center for American Studies. A noted scholar and valued colleague in the School of Liberal Arts, Dr. Sherrill led a vibrant team of interdisciplinary studies, during his tenure. Upon his passing in 2003, a national search was undertaken to fill the vacant position. A provision of the chair is that it be appointed according to the School of Liberal Arts’ needs, thus it is intended to “float” among disciplines.  Following a national search, Dr. Edward E. Curtis IV, was appointed as the second, and current holder of the named chair. Curtis, the award-winning author and editor of 13 books and publicly engaged scholar of Muslim American and Arab American history and life and Africana religions, recently launched the community storytelling platform, Arab Indianapolis , which explores the contributions of Arab-descended people to central Indiana. His innovative work and scholarship, engaging an underserved community, has expanded the reach of the acclaimed department of Religious Studies at IUPUI. The chair he has held since his arrival at IUPUI will henceforth be known as the William M. and Gail M. Plater Faculty Chair of Liberal Arts.  [Arab Indianapolis](https://arabindianapolis.com/)  Dr. Curtis shares his appreciation for the generosity of the Platers, “I am proud to be associated with Bill and Gail Plater who pioneered and modeled the IU School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI’s tradition of community-engaged research and teaching.”  The Dean of the IU School of Liberal Arts, Tamela Eitle, commented, “We are excited to recognize the Plater’s gift and thank them for their support in advancing the role of the liberal arts in an urban community-engaged research institution.” "

The project began in 2015 and focused on issues such as food, public art, parks, exercise, and amenities for the elderly. This year, Dr. Sue Hyatt , professor and chair of anthropology, and students followed up  on the results and asked residents what their communities still needed. The students found that residents still did not know of public transit options, lacked safe places for patients within the Dove Recovery House for Women, and continued to lack access to healthy fresh foods despite a new discount store in the area. To help residents, the students produced a cookbook of shared recipes from the neighborhood. Recipes and research are currently on display at the Mapleton-Fall Creek CDC offices (3190 N. Meridian St).

    "body": "  ## Liberal Arts Perspective on Diversity and Inclusion - Pathway Minor  The Diversity and Inclusion Pathway Minor is an interdisciplinary program of study allowing you to develop an understanding of the components of diversity, inclusion, power, and privilege, which include intersectional identities impacted by race, ethnicity, culture, gender, sexuality, religion, language, social class, aging, and disability.  This minor not only helps you in understanding the scholarship of diversity and inclusion but prioritizes applied knowledge through engaged learning experiences involving how diversity and inclusion can be examined and fostered within various personal and professional environments and interactions. This minor supports any major/profession that involves encounters, interactions, and work with diverse populations.  Professional fields in which a working and practical knowledge of how to respect and collaborate with those who have differing intersectional identities than one’s own include education, business, industry, social work, community and service organizations, government, law, and all of the health-related fields, such as medicine, nursing, dentistry, rehabilitation, and health administration.  Learning the ability to be conscious and reflective in regard to their own implicit biases and potential microaggressions can be extremely important to your success, for example, in health-related fields where you may be making care decisions can mean life or death for those you serve.   ### Prerequisites and Required Courses   #### Required courses (with minimum grades required)  With a minimum grade of C, students will complete 15 credit hours of approved Pathway Minors courses, including:  [modules](https://iu.instructure.com/enroll/YRXPJN)   #### Elective courses for the minor (with minimum grades required)  With a minimum grade of C, students will also complete elective courses including 9 additional credit hours of approved courses from the Introductory Thematic Concentration, Intermediate Thematic Concentration and Advanced Engaged Learning Experience categories.  To ensure a robust interdisciplinary experience, students should not take more than two courses from any one department/program as part of the 15-credit pathway minor.   ### Approved Courses   #### Introductory Thematic Concentration (3 credits)   #### Intermediate Thematic Concentration (3 credits)   #### Advanced Engaged Learning Experiences (3 credits)  *Students taking this course will be encouraged to enroll under this 300-level number. Students who take this course as ENG-L245 should request an exception from an advisor since this is currently the only one where the high impact practice is study abroad.  Other requirements and options:  [Pathway Minor module](https://iu.instructure.com/enroll/YRXPJN)   ### Additional Information  Students may petition, either before or after taking a course, to count a course toward the minor.

    "body": "  # Liberal Arts Paralegal Studies earns ABA approval  Wednesday, April 25, 2018  INDIANAPOLIS -- The paralegal job market is projected to soar at more than twice the rate of other occupations, according to a 2016 report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.  IUPUI students will be ready to capitalize on that, better than ever.  The Paralegal Studies program in the political science department of the Indiana University School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI recently received approval from the American Bar Association, the culmination of a two-year application process.  Students in the program can get a four-year degree in Law in Liberal Arts with a paralegal certificate or just the paralegal certificate if the student already has a bachelor's degree; both options prepare students for paralegal careers. IUPUI is one of only two four-year universities in Indiana to have ABA approval for its paralegal education.  \"Earning ABA approval is an important distinction that will greatly enhance our graduates' opportunities in Indianapolis, around the state and beyond,\" said Thomas Davis, dean of the IU School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI. \"Our students, in addition to getting a great education, will see the value of their degree in the field.\"  The ABA defines a paralegal as \"a person, qualified by education, training or work experience who is employed or retained by a lawyer, law office, corporation, governmental agency or other entity and who performs specifically delegated substantive legal work for which a lawyer is responsible.\" In short, paralegals can handle many legal duties, such as writing motions and briefs and working with clients, but they may not offer legal advice or speak in court.  There are close to 70 students on track for the bachelor's degree in Law in Liberal Arts.  \"Lawyers see ABA approval of a paralegal program as the gold standard because they all went to ABA-approved law schools,\" said Erin Engels, director of the Paralegal Studies program and a pre-law advisor. \"For Indianapolis, this approval will change the market.\"  Students from the IUPUI Paralegal Studies program have gone on to work in the Marion County prosecutor's office, the public defender's office, for Indiana Legal Services and in many local law firms; employment opportunities for graduates will only grow with ABA approval.  \"When I started, paralegals were only employed by huge law firms or personal injury firms,\" Engels said. \"Now, small and midsize firms see the value in having someone who's versed in legal training while also being organized and multitalented.\"  For more information about the ABA-approved paralegal studies program at IUPUI, contact professor Erin Engels at eengels@iupui.edu or visit the program's website .

    "body": "  ## Diversity Strategic Plan 2021-2024  August 23, 2021   ### Developed by the SLA Ad Hoc DEI Planning Committee:  Estela Ene (co-chair; Associate Professor of English), Jennifer Thorington Springer (co-chair; Professor of English, Associate Dean of Student Affairs), Holly Cusack-McVeigh (Associate Professor of Anthropology and Museum Studies), Sumedha Gupta (Associate Professor of Economics), Eric Hamilton (Grant Fiscal Specialist), Pamela Hinckle (Director of Spirit and Place), David Hoegberg (Associate Professor, Chair of the English Department), Samuel Kahn (Assistant Professor of Philosophy), Nichole Neuman (Assistant Professor of German), Lizeth Quinones Gamez (Assistant Director of Digital Media), Enric Mallorqui Ruscalleda (Assistant Professor of Spanish and Translation Studies), Angela Campbell (Anthropology Major), Elie Bucklin (Journalism Major), Marc Mcaleavey (SLA Alumni Board - At Large Member), Etta Ward (SLA Alumna, Assistant Vice Chancellor for Research Development), Rachel Wheeler (Associate Professor of Religious Studies)  The School of Liberal Arts has recently renewed its commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion by approving, in Faculty Assembly, the creation of its first DEI Standing Committee in 2019. While DEI conversations in the school had occurred over time, the founding of the SLA DEI Standing Committee marks a more intentional and systematic focus on DEI across the school. The Committee is made up of 10 members – faculty, staff, and students -- organized into several sub-committees that focus (and have accomplished or partially accomplished) a number of deliverables. The subcommittees focus on: DEI Search & Hire, DEI Training & Professional Development, ASL Accommodations, DEI Problem Resolution, DEI Awards & Recognition, and DEI microsite.  The SLA DEI Standing Committee formulated the school’s first Vision and Mission statement , which is aligned with IUPUI’s DEI vision and was approved by Faculty Assembly in Spring 2020.  The 2018 IUPUI Climate Survey revealed some areas of DEI in which the SLA is performing better or significantly better than other campus entities. For example, 62% of the SLA student respondents indicated that their coursework emphasized diversity “quite a bit” or “very much.” The percentage of SLA students who felt this way was significantly higher than other IUPUI students. Also, 89% of SLA faculty and staff and 88% of Liberal Arts students indicated that they feel safe enough to likely report bias/harassment/discrimination if they witnessed it. The strategic plan laid out below seeks to continue strengthening our relative strengths (such as curriculum and climate) as well as addressing issues of concern identified in the 2014 and 2018 climate surveys – namely, overall diversity, staff affairs, speaking up, women, and LGBTQ+ individuals.  The diversity strategic plan presented here was developed by the Ad Hoc DEI Strategic Planning Committee appointed by former Interim Dean Rebein in Fall 2020 with input from the DEI Standing Committee constituted a year earlier. The committee is co-led by Jennifer Thorington Springer (Associate Dean for Student Affairs, ex officio member of the DEI Standing Committee) and Estela Ene (chair of the DEI Standing Committee). The ad-hoc committee meets every other week. Prior to drafting goals and strategies, the committee engaged in a deep analysis and discussion of the 2014 and 2018 Climate Surveys, sample strategic plans, reflection tools and other materials provided by the office of the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. To ensure alignment with campus priorities, the committee chairs also participate in the campus-level Diversity Strategic Planning Leads Group. The SLA Ad-Hoc Committee was divided into affinity groups based on the four diversity indicators which form the backbone of the strategic plan. The drafts they developed were peer reviewed by the other groups, and the chairs composed a polished version of the plan. This was shared with the leadership of the campus-level Diversity Strategic Planning Leads Group as well as other SLA constituencies such as the Student Executive Council, Staff Executive Council, SLA Alumni Council, Diversity and Inclusion Standing Committee, and Faculty Affairs.   Finally, the chairs of the SLA DEI Strategic Planning Committee produced a revised version of the strategic plan, to which Dean Tami Eitle responded. The plan below is the outcome of this collaborative process.   ### Diversity Indicator I: Institutional Viability and Vitality  Goal: Increase DEI in the school by providing training for all and by improving faculty and staff retention through revised search/hire processes, focusing on career advancement for women and other minoritized groups, and leadership positions  Strategy 1:  Track and monitor institutional viability, examine group differences revealed by climate surveys or other data collected by IRDS  Responsible parties:  Timeline:  Metrics:  Strategy 2:  Train all faculty and staff about DEI to ensure our School embodies DEI values  Responsible parties:  Timeline:  Metrics:  Strategy 3:  Incorporate DEI goals and values in job announcements and the entire search and hire process  Responsible parties:  Timeline:  Metrics:  Strategy 4:  Establish processes and mentorship structures to support the advancement of women and minoritized groups into higher academic and administrative/leadership ranks  Responsible parties:  Timeline: Yearly  Metrics:   ### Diversity Indicator II: Education and Scholarship  Goal #1: Create Inclusive Classrooms  Strategy:  Incorporate the IUPUI Land Acknowledgment and other acknowledgements – for example, of Ransom Place and the displacement of African American communities on the land that IUPUI sits on now, perspectives of international students -- into the syllabus template for SLA courses, Canvas course homepages, and at the beginning of all SLA courses and sponsored events. See https://diversity.iupui.edu/land-acknowledgment/index.html and https://iu.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/t/1_9e97l6v0  [https://diversity.iupui.edu/land-acknowledgment/index.html](https://diversity.iupui.edu/land-acknowledgment/index.html)  [https://iu.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/t/1_9e97l6v0](https://iu.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/t/1_9e97l6v0)  Responsible party: Associate Deans of Student Affairs and Academic Programs  Timeline: Fall 2021  Metrics:  Strategy:  Encourage and inspire professional development around inclusive learning pedagogies by promoting the use of larger campus resources and creating a school-level module/series of modules and resource guide on DEI in the classroom that helps instructors engage deeply with DEI issues  Responsible party: Appointed Committee, Associate Dean of Student Affairs  Timeline: Spring 2023  Metrics:  Strategy:  Integrate opportunities in orientation and onboarding in Bridge and other experiences so that every student can learn about structural racism and inequity, with special focus on our own regional and institutional legacies  Responsible party:  Timeline:  Spring 2023  Metrics: Number of students who participated in an experience or completed a course on structural racism and inequity  Goal #2: Recognize and promote DEI scholarship in the School of Liberal Arts  Strategies:  Responsible parties:  Timeline: Fall 2023  Metrics:   ### Diversity Indicator III: Climate and Intergroup Relations  Goal: Create clear policies to address inequities in job expectations, compensation, and workload  Strategies:  Responsible parties:  Timeline: Fall 2021 – Spring 2024  Metrics:  Responsible parties: HR in collaboration with Liberal Arts Staff Executive Council, all SLA supervisors, and faculty representatives  Timeline: Fall 2021 - Spring 2022  Metrics:  Strategies:  Responsible party: Onboarding/Exiting Committee (see above strategy); Dean’s Office  Timeline: Fall 2021 - Fall 2022  Metrics:   ### Diversity Indicator IV: Access and Success (Student Centered)  Goal: Improve the recruitment and retention of underrepresented/underserved/underresourced/nontraditional students Strategies:  Responsible parties:  Timeline: Fall 2021 – Spring 2024  Metrics:  Number of pipelines created, partners contacted, admitted students and those re- enrolled Strategies:  Responsible parties:  Timeline: Fall 2021  Metrics:  Strategies:  Responsible parties:  Timeline: Fall 2021 – Spring 2022  Metrics: "

    "body": " Scope  The following policy shall apply to full-time tenured and tenure-line faculty, full-time lecturers, and full-time clinical appointments who have been identified by their department chair or program director to serve as faculty mentors for Liberal Arts students in their respective programs as of August 1, 2017. The faculty mentor role involves proactive outreach and engagement with assigned students and thus extends beyond the scope of an individual’s regular service commitment as a faculty member. Faculty mentors are appointed only in departments or programs that grant bachelor of arts or bachelor of science degrees from the School of Liberal Arts.  Policy Statement  This policy shall be used to determine the expectations, responsibilities, and compensation of an individual who agrees to serve as the faculty mentor for her/his department or program during the academic year for a three-year, renewable term.  At the time that the individual assumes the position of faculty mentor, a memorandum shall be created that sets forth the terms and conditions of the appointment. The terms and conditions therein will outline the minimum activities to be carried out by the assigned faculty mentor in a given academic year. The department chair or program director shall have the authority to assign additional duties and responsibilities within the intended scope of the role, in consultation with the dean.  The assigned faculty mentor shall receive one (1) course release per academic year. The course releases shall be planned in advance for the three-year term. In addition, the department or program shall receive funding not to exceed $500 per academic year from the dean’s office for programmed events for students. The faculty mentor and her/his department chair or program director shall agree on the terms and conditions of the role and provide signed documentation of the agreement to the dean, transmitted through the associate dean for student affairs.  If the assigned faculty mentor also holds the position of program director, coordinator of undergraduate programs, or a similar role, that individual’s compensation is subject to any existing contractual arrangement and, thus the individual shall not be eligible for the additional course release associated with the faculty mentor role.  Continuation in the role on an annual basis shall be determined by satisfactory performance as measured by an annual reporting of activities and evaluation by the chair and dean; chairs should transmit evaluations through the associate dean for student affairs. At such time as the individual relinquishes or is removed from the faculty mentor position prior to the completion of her/his term, the individual shall no longer be entitled to any remaining course releases associated with the role.  Procedures  At the time of appointment, the faculty mentor shall be required to engage in the following activities in agreement with the minimum standards of practice for a faculty mentor in service to Liberal Arts students:  Faculty mentors are also responsible for disseminating information on majors, minors, and certificates to prospective and current students, referring students to other student services on campus as needed, and directing students to opportunities that will enhance their overall academic success (e.g., internships; externships; co-curricular activities; RISE opportunities).  Effective: 08-01-2017 "

The Faculty Medal of Distinction is presented to the recipient during the annual Faculty Assembly Awards ceremony.  The faculty of the IU School of Liberal Arts nominate students based on:   ### 2023 Faculty Medal of Distinction Award Recipient  Olivia Ellenwood, 2023 Global and International Studies, B.A. Management and Civic Leadership. B.S.P.A. Political Science (minor) Honors College  Olivia Ellenwood exemplifies the broad academic excellence honored by the Faculty Medal of Distinction. Olivia graduated with a major in Global and International Studies and a minor in Political Science in the School of Liberal Arts, a second major in Civic Leadership Major from the School of Public and Environmental Affairs, and an Honors College degree.  Her stellar academic performance reflects her work ethic and genuine engagement as a student. With a keen interest in the development challenges facing sub-Saharan Africa, Olivia studied abroad in The Gambia and Senegal in the summer of 2022. She reflected that coming from a small hometown, in some ways, she found more in common with the rural Gambian villagers she lived and worked with than with fellow students from Indianapolis.  Olivia shared her passion for international experiences with other students by working as an Ambassador to Study Abroad programs. She has volunteered with Indy Urban Acres and funded her college education by working as a Senior Youth Development Professional at Boys and Girls Clubs of Indianapolis. As a student, a citizen, and a true leader with unlimited potential to impact the world in wonderful ways, Olivia Ellenwood exemplifies the spirit of excellence, talent, and passion that this award honors.   ## Past recipients "

    "body": "  ## DISCUSSION ITEM-for November 13, 2020 Faculty Assembly   ### Faculty Annual Report Supplement – 2020  Documenting Pandemic Impacts  The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on faculty workloads that must be recognized.  As outlined by University of Massachusetts-Amherst:  “Most faculty members have had to do significantly more work, moving courses online, mentoring students in need, reworking university programs and addressing COVID-19 risks, and helping communities manage current realities. At the same time, many faculty members are experiencing damage to their productivity and research record, due to lack of access to labs and facilities, research sites, and research subjects, as well as canceled conferences and inability to travel to conduct research and meet with collaborators.  These effects are exacerbated by differences among faculty. Those with children at home that need care or homeschooling or other family members that need care, face limited work time (research shows that women are submitting fewer journal articles during the pandemic). Women and faculty of color were already burdened by higher levels of mentoring students, which takes on new weight during the pandemic. Faculty of color are more likely to be suffering losses and providing care for extended family members. Those facing intersectional inequalities, such as women of color, face the highest burdens. Vulnerable faculty members may also be less comfortable drawing attention to COVID-19 impacts.”  (See: Documenting Pandemic Impacts: Best Practices .)  In keeping with the ‘best practices’ put forward by UMass-Amherst, the IUPUI School of Liberal Arts is encouraging faculty and departments to document the differential impacts to help with “mitigating against unequal outcomes” by facilitating units’ abilities “to assess faculty members fairly, accounting for their different working conditions under and even after the pandemic” ( Documenting Pandemic Impacts: Best Practices ).  While not required, faculty are encouraged to provide a self-report, as part of the DMAI FAReport, on the impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on their scholarly work.  This accounting should, as relevant, also include the impact on personal lives that was detrimental to scholarly work (e.g., increased care-giving requirements).  In keeping with the best practices referenced above, Annual Review Committees and Chairs:  should recognize the contributions faculty have made in various spheres, while considering each person’s specific working conditions, rather than comparing across faculty with different working conditions. Increased caregiving responsibilities or lack of access to research facilities as a result of the pandemic should not negatively affect assessments of faculty...  While not all faculty may wish to document health or caregiving impacts, reviewers should note that caregiving responsibilities or efforts toward homeschooling children (including single parenthood) reflects the disparate impact COVID-19 had on work-time for faculty members. Similarly, documentation of illness, risk of illness (pre-existing conditions, partnership with an essential worker), or loss of loved ones, provides greater context for assessments. De-stigmatizing care and illness is important to creating fair assessments. Personnel Committees may write a standardized acknowledgement of pandemic impacts with particular attention to their field and expected disruptions to work for all faculty members. This statement could be inserted at the beginning of each PC memo responding to faculty submission as context for the annual review.  To facilitate the documentation of pandemic impacts, faculty may use the FAReport COVID Supplement template provided on the next page.  The goal is to provide context to help reviewers account for individual situations while at the same time not adding significantly more work to the documentation requested in support of the annual review process.  Documenting Pandemic Impacts: FAReport COVID Supplement  The following is a list of areas of faculty work that have been commonly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as identified by UMass-Amherst (See: Documenting Pandemic Impacts: Best Practices ).  Faculty are encouraged, but not required , to highlight the areas that apply to them and briefly provide both documentation and commentary.  For those that don’t apply, simply delete them.  When completing Faculty Annual Reviews for faculty, department chairs should recognize the contributions faculty have made in teaching, research and service while considering each person’s specific working conditions as impacted (or not) by the COVID-19 pandemic, as self-reported by faculty.

    "body": "  # Museum studies students shine as Museum of Broken Relationships Indianapolis exhibit opens  Wednesday, February 08, 2023  University research can have a huge impact in the life of a student and the IU School of Liberal Arts Museum Studies Program is excelling in providing research opportunities that are greatly enriching its undergraduate and graduate students. Several Museum Studies students are taking part in a new academic challenge and discovering their passion for community-engaged research.  The Museum Studies Program is partnering with the Museum of Broken Relationships (MBR) and members of our local communities to create The Museum of Broken Relationships Indianapolis, an interdisciplinary project featuring an exhibition and related public programs that will open for viewing at the Herron Galleries February 8 through April 22, with additional sites throughout Indianapolis.  [Museum of Broken Relationships](https://brokenships.com/)  [exhibition](https://events.iu.edu/liberalartsiupui/event/823438-museum-of-broken-relationships-indianapolis)  [Herron Galleries](https://herron.iupui.edu/galleries/index.html)  The Museum of Broken Relationships Indianapolis is a global, crowd-sourced project that gathers anonymous donations and stories of experience with love and loss from around the world. While MBR has a brick-and-mortar museum in Zagreb, Croatia, MBR’s co-founders Olinka Vištica and Dražen Grubišič take their concept on the road, globally, to create community-based, local exhibitions that each blend community donations and themes with those from other countries in thought-provoking ways. Each exhibition becomes a unique exploration of love, loss, and growth by merging individual, communal, and universal perspectives.   ##### Building a team  Museum Studies faculty members Lois H. Silverman and Laura M. Holzman are leading the project, which features a team of students, community partners, and IUPUI faculty and staff. “We’re able to develop this multi-layered project thanks to generous support from Edgar and Dorothy Fehnel, Herron Galleries, and the IUPUI Center for Service and Learning”, said Dr. Laura Holzman, Associate Professor and Director, Museum Studies Program and Public Scholar, Curatorial Practices and Visual Art.  [Lois H. Silverman](https://liberalarts.iupui.edu/programs/museum-studies/directory/lois-h-silverman/)  [Laura M. Holzman](https://liberalarts.iupui.edu/programs/museum-studies/directory/laura-holzman/)  This collaboration builds on Dr. Lois H. Silverman’s long-standing work with MBR, begun through The Social Work of Museums (Routledge 2010), and her course-based partnership with MBR last fall. The project exemplifies the collaborative, applied, and community-engaged approaches at the heart of the IUPUI Museum Studies Program. “We are proud and honored to be the first Museum Studies program in the U.S. to partner with the Museum of Broken Relationships,” said Dr. Lois H. Silverman, Professor and Public Scholar of Museum Education.   ##### Students are leading the way  Graduate and undergraduate students are playing important roles in every aspect of the project. Thanks to a generous grant from the Office of Service and Learning, three Museum Studies MA students have been appointed this year as Community Engagement Associates (CEAs). Marissa Hamm serves as Programs and Project Management CEA, Emily McMath serves as Evaluation CEA, and Shelby Riley is fulfilling the role of Exhibits and Marketing CEA. All three will graduate this spring.  “Working with the Museum of Broken Relationships Indianapolis project as a graduate student has pushed the creative boundaries of my museum practice and opened my eyes to how museums can truly be community-centered”, said Marissa Hamm, museum studies graduate student. “The Museum of Broken Relationships has made me feel closer to the global community in which I live. We are less alone than we think and MBR can help us learn from and laugh about the ways that we all experience love, loss, and growth throughout our lives.”  Many more students have been involved in the project through three different Museum Studies courses. Students in Dr. Holzman’s Fall 2022 Curatorial Practices course (cross-listed between SLA/MSTD and Herron) directly contributed to creating the exhibit. In addition, they invited individuals in the Indianapolis region to donate objects and stories of broken relationships, which will now become part of the Museum’s global collection. They worked with MBR to help identity the themes and objects of the Herron Galleries exhibit, and they also curated satellite displays – small branches of the exhibit that will appear at sites across campus and Indianapolis.  Graduate and undergraduate students in Dr. Silverman’s Fall 2022 Museum Education course (SLA/MSTD) worked with the Museum of Broken Relationships and local partners to develop a series of public programs and related educational resources for the exhibit. These public programs will take place on and off campus throughout the run of the exhibit. From “A Fair of the Heart” on the evening of February 14 at Herron galleries to “Social/Action: A Closing Celebration” on April 22, these programs offer audiences more opportunities to creatively engage the project themes of love, loss, and growth.  This semester, students in Dr. Silverman’s Museums and Audiences course (SLA/MSTD) will be helping to implement an IRB-approved evaluation study of the ways in which visitors interact with the exhibit and programs, and the overall project impact.  Across all three courses, students are strengthening key museum skills as they help to bring the Museum of Broken Relationships Indianapolis to our campus and community.  To learn more about the project from the students’ perspectives, check out their posts on the Museum Studies Program blog.

    "body": " Minutes  Faculty Assembly, School of Liberal Arts 2:00–4:00 pm Friday, September 15, 2017, CE450 Faculty Attendees: Robert Aponte, Aniruddha Banerjee, Wan-Ning Bao, David Beck, Emily Beckman, Rick Bein, David Bell, Gail Bennett, Dennis Bingham, David Bivin, Ulf Jonas Bjork, Bill Bomquist, Amy Bombke, Maria Brann, Andy Buchenot, Jennifer Bute, Chad Carmichael, Thorsten Carstensen, Subir Chakrabarti, Charmayne Champion-Shaw, Mary Ann Cohen, Martin Coleman, David Craig, Kevin Cramer, Edward Curtis, Thom Davis, Andre De Tienne, Conelis, De Waal, Tijen Demirel-Pegg, Fred DiCamilla, Mitchell Douglas, Aaron Dusso, Owen Dwyer, Estela Ene, Amanda Friesen, Rosario Garnemark, Gina Gibau, Philip Goff, Nancy Goldfarb, Claudia Grossman, Sumedha Gupta, Jannah Haas, Ray Haberski, Kelly Hayes, Ronda Henry Anthony, Bruce Hetrick, David Hoegberg, Krista Hoffmann-Longtin, Mike Hughes, Susan Hyatt, Andrea Jain, Lynn Jettpace, Sumana Jogi, Daniel Johnson, John Kaufman-McKivigan, Mohammad Kaviani, Jason Kelly, Jaesoo Kim, Francia Kissel, Daniella Kostroun, Karen Kovacik, Christian Kraatz, Elizabeth Kryder-Reid, Missy Dehn Kubitschek, Keiko Kuriyama, Christopher Lamb, Kenzie Latham Mintus, Kathryn Lauten, Sarah Layden, Erik Lindseth, Vijay Lulla, Timoth Lyons, Jennifer Price Mahoney, Yin Hing Mak, Patrick Meister, Amanda Miller, Leslie Miller, Kyle Minor, Megan Musgrave, Anita Morgan, Gwendolyn Morrison, Paul Mullins, Patricia O’Neil, John Parrish-Sprowl, Lynn Pike, Mike Polites, Rob Rebein, Audrey Ricke, Nancy Robertson, Stephanie Rose, Anne Royalty, Steve Russell, David Sabol, Ronald Sandwina, Carly Schall, Jane Schultz, Daniela Schuvaks-Katz, Ian Sheeler, Krtina Sheeler, Susan Shepherd, Rebecca Shrum, Brian Steensland, Shana Stump, Vidhura Tennekoon, Elizabeth Thill, Jennifer Thorington Springer, Peter Thuesen, Joseph Tucker Edmonds, Thom Upton, Julie Vincent, Jing Wang, Scott Weeden, Rachel Wheeler, Kim White-Mills, Jefferey Wilson, Jeremy Wilson, Mel Wininger, Elee Wood, Iker Zulaica Hernandez Guest Attendees: Eric Hamilton, Martha Rujuwa, Edith Millikan, Kathy Johnson, Camy Broeker, Jack Windsor, Rachel Applegate, Sam Walters, Shannon Kelley, Amy Jones Richardson, Lisa Julian, Kim Heavrin, Chris Schumerth, Ellen Van Der Voorde, Connie Ely, Rick Hansen, Gauri Drunumraju, David Heard, Tanner Hammock, Lauri Watkins, Martha Payne, Merle Illg 1. Call to order at 2:00 p.m. —Herbert Brant  2. Approval of the minutes from April 21, 2017 a. Minutes approved. Following approval, the Assembly moved from 405 to 450 to accommodate all attendees.  3. Update on the financial situation of the School - Kathy E. Johnson (Executive Vice Chancellor and Chief Academic Officer) and Camy Broeker ((Vice Chancellor for Administration and Finance) a. Brant also introduced guests Jack Windsor (IFC Budget Affairs Committee), Margie Ferguson (Executive Vice Chancellor), and Rachel Applegate (President of IFC).  K. Johnson recommended an additional meeting later to do a “deep dive” into the fiscal situation. This is not a new problem; the decline started in 2010-11. Most of the credit hour loss has been at 300-400 levels which indicates fewer majors/minors in Liberal Arts. As a state, Indiana does prioritize higher education and has not seriously decreased funding; however, the state is pressured to condense the amount of time it takes to complete a degree. Legislation has had a big effect - number of courses we can require in a major, dual-credit, degree maps, 21st Century Scholars, etc.. We need to focus on those things we can control. Liberal Arts is crucial to the educational lives of our students; the school is not going to close. But numbers are changing, and we have an imbalance in the number of faculty and the number of credit hours. Banded tuition and degree maps have had an effect, but that effect has been generally positive. This summer saw a >20% drop in enrollments from last year. Credits were expected to stay about the same, so that drop was devastating. No more cash is available to make up the shortfall, and fall is already below projections. Johnson’s letter was based on policies found in the Faculty Guidelines. The university now expects a budget pro forma for the next five years to show how the school will become self-supporting and pay back any debts incurred. All faculty need to be involved. Johnson’s office is willing to help us in any way. Boyd Bradshaw’s office can help with an enrollment management plan; Ferguson’s office can help with faculty affairs. Broeker said that RCM is great until enrollments start declining. They are hoping to help us be creative and pro-active in putting this plan together. Earlier this week, Brant provided faculty an opportunity to submit questions. He compiled them, and Johnson then addressed them. 1. What will the response from campus be to our plan? How much are we expected to cut from our budget and when do we need to have these cuts made? a. Johnson said she wanted to encourage creativity. They have no firm expectations. Her office will provide as much feedback as possible as soon as possible. The plan is due October 31 because they have report to university administration. Camy Broeker said the plan is not set in stone; there is flexibility, but there is also accountability.  2. What recommendations do they have for cost-cutting options in other than faculty reductions? a. 80% of SLA’s budget is faculty salary/comp, so it needs to be on the table. In 2008, SLA had 216 faculty teaching 129,432 credit hours. Currently, SLA has 240 faculty teaching 121,000 credit hours. By comparison, School of Science has 62 fewer faculty teaching about 20,000 more credit hours.  Reorganizing degree programs to maximize credit hours is a possibility. Also doing a better job of coordinating the schedule would be effective. Fewer people scheduling classes would tighten up the balance. Moving SLA programs back into Cavanaugh would help cut costs on rent we pay to other buildings. We may need to think creatively about space. $1.5 million goes to associate faculty, so we need to look at that number as well. Johnson encouraged us to think creatively about all these options. 3. What recommendations are there for preventing drops in students/majors as faculty leave and are not replaced? a. Johnson suggested creatively thinking about our teaching strategies – enabling us to teach fewer sections with more students. Online offerings could be designed to maximize enrollment while not sacrificing pedagogy. In the summer, online courses were the ones that filled. Students often say they need to go home to work in the summer; online offerings allow them to take classes from any location.  Inter-disciplinary offerings, especially in FYE and capstone, could also encourage creative activity, pedagogy and scholarly work, while maximizing teaching. The campus wants to “do no harm.” to the good work that we do. 4. If SLA is truly important to the university, how will the campus and university help SLA? a. The RCM model means schools get to keep their profits, but they are also responsible for their deficits. It also means there is not a lot of money at the center. The campus is able to provide support on enrollment management plans. Consultants are also a possibility. We now have a curriculum committee at the campus level. That committee might be able to look at our situation and make recommendations; perhaps the whole campus might require students to have a minor or a diversity awareness course. The campus can facilitate space transitions.  Campus has already provided $100,000 for the “Liberal Arts Works” campaign to promote SLA. 5. How can admissions/recruitment/retention offices encourage enrollment in SLA courses? a. Office of Admissions’ primary goal is to get students into IUPUI. They do work with schools to recruit. Some schools have worked very closely with Admissions to recruit. We do, however, have a “no-poaching rule.” Exploratory students are in play, as well as students who have indicated an interest in a particular field. We might also use market analysis to identify high-demand, but under-enrolled programs. Office of Admissions will have some of that data. Branding of those programs might be effective. Faculty will need to be heavily involved in that branding to make sure it reflects our priorities and values. We should also think creatively about our community presence; we can be ambassadors of our school. Finally, some institutions have had their faculty go into high schools to teach; by offering dual-credit classes at the high school level, they were able to create a pipeline to their program, particularly with underrepresented populations. Office of Community Engagement could also be helpful with that strategy.  6. When the campus gets behind a campaign, we see results. How can campus communications experts strengthen messaging about the value of SLA? a. Working closely with Undergrad Admissions and marketing a message through IU Communication could be effective. SLA needs to think about what we’re most proud of in our programs and communicate it in a way that the public can comprehend it easily. Other programs might be easier to market, so we need to think creatively about how we can do that with attention-getting images. Boyd Bradshaw would be the broker for that. The campus does not control all communications; it is at the university level which sometimes complicates matters.  7. What can we do about assessments? a. $3.1 million had to be cut from the campus budget as a result of the reorganization with School of Medicine. The Chancellor refused to pass that cut on to the schools. That complicates things, but the vice chancellors are trying to minimize assessments.  A review was done of RCM last year. The task force recommended that the campus does need to do its part; however, because of RCM, when credit hours go down in any one school, other schools pay an increase in assessments. There are ripple effects. Rachel Applegate, president of faculty council, invited us to send questions to her if we think of them later. The Budget Affairs Committee will have primary oversight of our process. They want us to be empowered and creative, and they want to support us rather than jump in. Jack Windsor, offered to help in any way possible. Brant opened the floor to questions and asked why the draft of our plan is due so quickly —by 10/31? Broeker answered that because IUPUI’s fiscal analysis has to be reported to the university by early in November, they need our draft as they prepare their report. We need to present a plan to avoid having someone from outside campus make these decisions for us. Edward Curtis [RELS], was hoping to get a more specific idea of how much money we need to cut and what is the “low-hanging fruit”? A more specific number may help with morale. Curtis also suggested all speakers use the microphone to accommodate any attendees with hearing impairments. Broeker answered that we had a planned deficit this year of $2.8 million. We need a 3% cash reserve to cover shortfalls. Current reserve is 1.3 million. Retirements have helped, but with the loss of credit hours this fall, our target should be upwards of $2 million. We need to be strategic. Karen Kovacik [ENG] asked if we currently then have a shortfall of $2.2 million. Broeker said yes, but that is only a current snapshot. David Craig [RELS] asked about date/timeframe to get into the black and pay back any debt the school incurs. Broeker indicated a 4-5 year timeframe - “Concrete with as much flexibility as possible.” Law school had a 3-year plan but they were able to turn around in 18 months. D. Craig asked what percentage of the campus budget is covered by SLA assessments. Broeker said she would send that information. FTE, credit hour, budget and assessment information will be sent to us by her office. 4. President's remarks — Herbert Brant a. Brant introduced the new Agenda Council, which will be working on revisions of the bylaws and voting mechanisms to make it more discreet and effective. The council will also be looking at course evaluations. In January, we will be doing a celebration of faculty accomplishments.  Committees need to submit year-end reports, so we can continue our important work with as much information as possible. Brant encouraged us to think of ourselves as a school, supporting each other, no matter what departments we are in. To move forward, we need to work together. 5. New business  . In memoriam: Our colleague, Brian McDonald, lost his battle to cancer last spring – Rob Rebein. A celebration of Brian’s life was to be held after the Assembly. A scholarship will be established in his name for a literature student in our program. He invited all to attend and consider contributing to the scholarship fund.  . In memoriam: Our valued colleague, Ana Vicente, who passed away last spring – Amy Bombke. WLAC lost Ana in April. She will be dearly remembered by us all.  . Action item: Certificate in Social Justice Organizing - Emily Beckman, Undergraduate Curriculum Committee– This was approved at the last committee meeting last spring. Sue Hyatt was available to answer any questions. Floor was opened for discussion. Proposal was passed unanimously.  6. Old business  . Second read: Revised Faculty Annual Review Guidelines and Form — Sue Hyatt, Faculty Affairs Committee o Faculty Affairs has looked at the review system. Hyatt invited questions and comments. Decimals are being considered. Brant requested that faculty look at the documents and send questions to Hyatt.  . Action item: Guidelines for Performance Review and Reappointment of Professors of Practice — Ray Haberski, Promotion and Tenure Committee o Haberski invited discussion on the revision. The guidelines were passed unanimously.  . The New SLA Promotion and Tenure Guidelines were removed as an action item and returned for a second read.  7. Introduction of new faculty and staff – Tom Davis a. Alex Badillo – Anthropology  b. Steve Overbey – Communication Studies, Director of Public Speaking  c. Katherine Blake – English  d. Vidhura Tennekoon – Economics  e. Andrea Meyer Smith - Spanish  f. Lauryn Andrews – Event Specialist  g. Roger Kraft – American Sign Language  h. Stacy Lewis - American Sign Language  i. Rosario Garnemark – Spanish/Translation  j. Brynn Nightenhelser – PIE  k. Lisa Saunders – Administrative Support  l. Lygia Vernon – Advisor  m. Elee Wood – Student Affairs, Associate Dean  n. Aaron Dusso – Acting chair, Political Science  o. Imaculada Naranjo –Mateos – Director, Spanish Resource Center  p. Glenn Snyder – Director, Classical Studies  q. Julie White - American Sign Language  8. Dean’s Remarks: a. Merle Illg will post today’s PowerPoint, which includes a full list of new appointments, awards, promotions, and grants.  Dean Davis asked faculty to look at Appendix D in the IUPUI Faculty Guide. We are not in financial exigency; we are in crisis, an important distinction. Over the next six weeks, we must develop a plan to prevent exigency. In spite of the crisis, we continue to things very well. We must continue to do those things and celebrate those things: promotions, awards, student achievements, research and creative activity, grants. 71 faculty were promoted or received awards/grants in the past year. We have also developed new programs: • LAMP  • 6-year BA/JD  • American Studies PhD  • MA TESOL  Our Development was very successful last year and even exceeded expectations. Eleven new scholarships have come online this past year. School website is being redesigned. Approximately fifteen new department/ program sites are being launched; five more are in development. New marketing materials, social media are being developed and enhanced, highlighting our successful graduates. Staff reorganization is complete, and the Dean thanked all the individuals involved in that complex process. Credit hours do continue to slide, which hurts our bottom line because that is where we get the majority of our income. We have seen a 12% drop in credit hours, which is a 16% drop in revenue. About 2% of that drop was a result of ICR dollars. The Midwest Student Exchange Scholarships was an unexpected charge of $800,000; if not for that charge, we would have reduced our expenditures from the previous year. 91% of our budget is related to people, about 80% in salaries. The next largest is financial aid, then travel expenses. 30% of our students now bring in credit for W131 from elsewhere. We are seeing a 3.2% credit hour drop this fall compared to last fall, but we have increased our offerings of 2nd 8-week courses which will help make up that deficit. We are at 57,000 credit hours, the lowest since 1998. We are down in current majors; we graduated 765 last year. Other schools – Science (2006), Law – have gone through this situation and have gotten out of it. We will as well. Our plan and 5-year budget needs to show how we will “right the ship.” The Dean’s Office, Resources & Planning, and Agenda Council are meeting together to consult with other committees to set up the plan. At least two town hall meetings will be held by the end of October, and we can invite K. Johnson and C. Broeker. We will have the rough draft done by the end of October. A final draft should be brought forward at the November Faculty Assembly. Faculty will then vote either to support or not support the plan. Creative ideas should be directed to Dean Davis who will direct them to committees as appropriate. We have already invested a lot in the growth side (Liberal Arts Works, LAMP), but that’s usually a long-term strategy. In the short-term, we need to work on the expense side. Dean Davis’s primary goal is to protect people and essential programs. We have to support our critical work even as we lose faculty through attrition; this will cause imbalance in some departments. For example in one year, English will have lost 8 people. Missy Kubitschek [ENG] asked if the committee will have solid projections on how many students will be bringing in general education credits. Dean Davis said we are going to ask for as much data as possible. Schools are under pressure to condense the time to complete a degree; however, dual-credit and AP credit may not be serving the students. Nancy Robertson [HIST] asked how teaching dual-credit courses in high schools would help the school or faculty workload. We will need to analyze that before we make such recommendations. Boise State U had success with it, but IU-Kokomo faced challenges. Dean Davis will follow up. Eric Saak [HIST] asked about the October plan not being voted on until November assembly. Dean Davis said the October plan is a draft that campus has to have to show to the IU President, but the November version may be changed from the October iteration when faculty vote on it. The plan is not “set in stone.” Faculty will see a draft at the last town hall. Adjournment at 4:10 p.m. "

    "body": "  #### POLICY ON THREE-YEAR FORMATIVE REVIEW OF TENURE-PROBATIONARY FACULTY AND LIBRARIANS  IUPUI faculty and librarians (hereinafter referred to collectively as “the faculty” or “the faculty member(s)”) represent our campus’s most valuable resource. The University makes a substantial long-term investment in its faculty. Our tenure-probationary faculty’s success must be among the highest priorities for all campus administrative officers.  While IUPUI has in place an annual review policy mandating that all faculty members be provided with a yearly written evaluation of their work in the areas of teaching, research, and service (or, in the case of librarians, the equivalent areas of performance, professional development, and service), these annual reviews are frequently conducted by the department chair or the school dean alone, without the participation of a peer review committee.  The Policy To ensure that all tenure-probationary faculty members benefit from helpful and meaningful assessments of their progress toward promotion and tenure near the mid-point of their probationary period, a THREE-YEAR FORMATIVE REVIEW [hereinafter referred to as the “REVIEW”] shall be conducted on all such faculty members during the spring semester of the third year of their appointments in accordance with the following guidelines.  Applicability This policy applies to all tenure-probationary faculty members at IUPUI, with the exceptions noted immediately below. The term “third year” refers to the third full academic year of the tenure-probationary faculty member’s appointment. However, faculty members who enter with one year of credit toward tenure are in their “third year” during their second full academic year of appointment, and those who enter with two years of credit are in their “third year” during their first full academic year of appointment. Those who enter either with tenure or with more than two years of credit toward tenure are exempt from the REVIEW.  Procedures In schools or units where faculty-approved policies or guidelines for conducting the REVIEW already exist, those policies or guidelines should be followed to the extent that they do not seriously conflict with the general procedures set forth below. If there is conflict, especially regarding due dates and required documentation, such schools or units ought to resolve it by either revising their policies or guidelines accordingly, or negotiating special arrangements with the Office of the Dean of the Faculties.  In schools or units where such policies or guidelines have not yet been formulated or approved by the faculty, the REVIEW shall in the interim be conducted in adherence with the following general considerations.  Documentation and Reporting A copy of each review report, whether by the Committees, the chair, or the dean, shall be communicated to the faculty member under review within three days of the time it is completed. To ensure that the REVIEW is properly conducted for all applicable tenure-probationary faculty members, the dean of each school shall be responsible for submitting copies of the chair’s (if applicable), the dean’s and the Committees’ reports on all tenure-probationary faculty members who have been reviewed to the Chief Academic Officer through Faculty Appointments and Advancement by May 1 each year. One searchable PDF file for each tenure-probationary faculty member should be sent electronically to ofaa@iupui.edu.  Limitation on the Use of the REVIEW The thrust of the REVIEW shall be to help the tenure-probationary faculty member to succeed. The REVIEW and its findings shall NOT be used by the department chair or the school dean, or the Office of the Dean of the Faculties, as the basis for a tenure decision, a pre-tenure decision, a reappointment or non-reappointment decision, or any personnel action of like kind. The tenure- probationary faculty member is not limited in the use of the REVIEW. [1] Some schools require far more than this (e.g., list of potential reviewers, summary of pre-IU professional activities, previous annual reviews, letters from students, or even a dossier “that is identical in substance and format to that which they will submit for the actual review two years later”). The present policy does not encourage premature requisites or burdensome requirements. "

    "body": "  # IUPUI helps highlight China's 'Fortune' for PBS  By: Tim Brouk  Monday, October 09, 2017  Ian McIntosh went 40 years between his first visit to China and his most recent.  McIntosh's trip in April was as part of a Public Broadcasting Service crew shooting a 27-minute documentary on the Maritime Silk Road 's history and current development s .  [Maritime Silk Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritime_Silk_Road)  [current development](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/china-unveils-maritime-silk-road-plans/articleshow/59238384.cms)  [s](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/china-unveils-maritime-silk-road-plans/articleshow/59238384.cms)  His first trip to China was in 1977. McIntosh was an undergraduate attending the University of Queensland in Australia, studying abroad in a then ultra-communist China. In 2017, he is the voice of the new PBS documentary \"Waves of Fortune: China's Maritime Silk Road,\" which airs at 7:30 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 12, on WFYI 1. The documentary's premiere will be screened at noon Wednesday, Oct. 11, at the Campus Center Theater. \"Waves of Fortune\" will stream at wfyi.org starting Oct. 20.  [\"Waves of Fortune: China's Maritime Silk Road,\"](https://vimeo.com/234589103)  [wfyi.org](https://www.wfyi.org/)  While China is still a communist country, 21st-century capitalism has just as strong a presence, if not more. Then there are the thousands of years of history, religion and tradition mixed in. The juxtaposition of ancient temples and modern high-rises was a common sight during this trip.  \"The change I witnessed over 40 years was extraordinary,\" said McIntosh, director of international partnerships for the Office of International Affairs and associate director of the Confucius Institute in Cavanaugh Hall, comparing his first and latest sojourns to China. \"In 1977, militant atheism was the law, and China was a socialist state ruled by a dictatorship of the proletariat. The idea of private enterprise for personal gain was frowned upon in Marxist circles.\"  [Confucius Institute](http://www.iupui.edu/~china/)  With producer Sandy Roob, videographer Vinnie Manganello and translator Dr. Zao C. Xu, director of the Confucius Center in Indianapolis, McIntosh did four different \"stand-ups\" in the Chinese cities of Quanzhou and Guangzhou. The two ports anchored the Maritime Silk Road. Most maps have this \"road\" stretching from Egypt to Japan, with numerous stops along coastal China. It also connects to Indonesia and Korea.  The \"Waves of Fortune\" team shot two days in Quanzhou, home to landmarks like the Tianhou Temple and Qingjing Mosque, and six days in Guangzhou, which holds the Hualin Buddhist Temple and the massive Canton import-and-export fair. McIntosh then recorded the voice-over at the WFYI studios in Indianapolis.  The original Silk Road dates back thousands of years and consisted of a 4,350-mile land trek from Western Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia to eastern China. The Silk Road concept is being revisited in modern China with an investment of trillions of dollars into establishing six land \"corridors\" and the revamping of the Maritime Silk Road. Dubbed \"One Belt, One Road,\" the strategy looks to unify and develop more trading with European, African and Asian countries.  [\"One Belt, One Road,\"](https://qz.com/983460/obor-an-extremely-simple-guide-to-understanding-chinas-one-belt-one-road-forum-for-its-new-silk-road/)  The project concentrates on the oceanic version of the Silk Road. Most of the documentary looks at the history of the ancient trade routes that helped spread goods, culture and religion throughout China and to other parts of the world. The documentary is organized into five sections, or \"waves\" -- \"Ancient Trade,\" \"Indian Influences,\" \"Middle Eastern Golden Era,\" \"European and U.S. Entrance\" and \"Current Commerce.\"  Chinese historians, scholars and entrepreneurs were interviewed while hours of beautiful B-roll were shot. The \"Waves of Fortune\" team saw a diverse array of Middle Eastern, Indian and African traders living in the port city of Guangzhou. At the Canton Fair, which drew 250,000 people per day, the crew met a mother and son who travel the Silk Road for business -- much like their ancestors. They also met a Canadian businessman trying to get his line of hot tubs into big-box stores. The event ran two weeks and brought together manufacturers from around the globe.  \"The import-export complex was huge,\" Roob recalled. \"It seemed like it was the size of maybe 20 of our convention center combined.\"  While they chose Guangzhou and Quanzhou for their roles in the Maritime Silk Road and their current status as active port cities, McIntosh and Roob were impressed with the temples and ancient monuments away from the ships. Traditional Chinese religion played a role in the Maritime Silk Road, and Roob was sure to get footage of the Tianhou Temple. With hundreds paying respects to Mazu , the patron goddess of sailors in Chinese beliefs, Roob discovered how revered the goddess still is in 2017. The city's link to the ocean is as strong as it was 1,000 years ago. Another shoot took the team to the Hualin Temple in Guangzhou, a landmark for Zen Buddhist practitioners.  [Mazu](http://www.goddessgift.com/goddess-myths/goddess-mazu.htm)  [Hualin Temple](http://www.guangzhou.chn.info/attractions/temples-churches-mosques/hualin-temple.html)  During his studies for his Ph.D. in anthropology at Charles Darwin University, McIntosh became fascinated with 1,000-year-old African coins that were discovered in northern Australia , where he lived. He had studied the Silk Road before, but this discovery entrenched him in the study of the Maritime Silk Road.  [discovered in northern Australia](http://www.ancient-origins.net/news-history-archaeology/ancient-african-coins-found-australia-pose-interesting-questions-about-021527)  McIntosh is set to return to China later this month, this time for a global pilgrimage conference in Beijing. While high-rises and a soaring economy are fixtures in Chinese development, the allure and blend of old and new still make the nation a fascinating topic for research and discussion. Being a part of the documentary gave McIntosh new energy for his decades of research.  \"It was a wonderful experience,\" McIntosh said. \"I found it personally challenging and enriching.\" "

    "body": " November 10, 2017  To: Kathy Johnson, Executive Vice Chancellor Margie Ferguson, Senior Associate Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs From: School of Liberal Arts Faculty Assembly RE: Potential Change in Interpretation of P&T Committee Size  By a vote of X to Y, the faculty of the School of Liberal Arts stand opposed to the reinterpretation of the long-time understanding of the campus P&T guidelines with regard to the minimum number of members on a committee, which the school has understood for at least the past two decades to be a committee of no fewer than four.  Our opposition to this reinterpretation is three-fold.  First, and most importantly, primary committees are charged with evaluating a candidate's activities and scholarship in his or her primary areas of expertise, hence the name “primary” committee, also often called at many universities “departmental” committees.  Requiring more than 4 primary committee members will fundamentally change P&T in most departments in the School of Liberal Arts, especially in cases when there are associate professors going up for promotion, as most do not have more than four full professors (not including the chair).  The implications of a change in primary committee size will be that for many P&T cases, faculty from other disciplinary areas will have to be recruited to participate on primary committees.  This is counter to the spirit of peer review as primary committee members should be expected to understand the norms of scholarship in the candidate's primary field, and when a majority of a committee come from outside of the primary field simply so that some arbitrary target number or reviewers can be met, the disciplinary evaluation is diluted or lost.  The importance of the primary committee’s role in the P&T process is, in fact, highlighted in the current campus and school P&T guidelines and IUPUI Faculty Guide.  The following excerpts underscore the disciplinary expertise that is assumed by the primary committee in its evaluative process.  (Text italicized to emphasize key role of disciplinary expertise in the review process.)  Department Primary Committee (School P&T Guidelines)  Department Primary Committee (Campus P&T Guidelines)  Review letter and vote from the Primary/Department Committee  S c h ool P&T Committee (Campus P&T Guidelines)  In evaluating a candidate for promotion and/or tenure, the committee will carefully consider all the information provided by the candidate, as well as the recommendation of the primary committee and the department’s chair. The committee shall also take into consideration the guidelines and criteria for promotion and/or tenure of the candidate’s department . …  The SLA Promotion and Tenure Committee will evaluate the recommendations of the primary committee and the department chair, taking into consideration whether the recommendations are based on adequate peer review , whether the rights of the candidate have been safeguarded in accordance with university-established procedures, and whether the academic mission, responsibilities, and expectations under which the candidate had originally been hired have been taken into account.  IUPUI Faculty Guide  Promotion considerations must take into account the individual’s contribution to the school/campus mission as well as differences in mission of varying primary and unit levels (p. 38).  [Third-year review] The chief purpose of the REVIEW is to provide tenure-probationary faculty members with feedback from the school or unit level review committees regarding their cumulative progress toward promotion and tenure. Hence, other than the department chair or school dean, involvement by the department’s Primary Committee (where applicable) and/or the school’s Unit Committee (where applicable) in the REVIEW is essential (p. 49).  The tenure review is a multi-level review, conducted at the primary , unit, campus, and university levels (p. 51).  Second, as would be the case in smaller departments with only a couple of full professors, the logistics of simply having to find four or five full professors (rather than one or two) somewhere in the school and/or across campus who also were not already serving on the School P&T Committee would be next to impossible.  Multiply that by three or four candidates who might go up for promotion to full professor in any given year; there may well not be enough full professors in the school to do what is being proposed, especially once you remove any who are either serving in an upper administration role or on a sabbatical leave; at the least, every eligible full professor in the school may well be required to serve on a primary committee every year in one department or another.  This is overly burdensome and unrealistic.  Third, if a smaller department with two full professors were in fact required to enlist five additional full professors from outside the department and possibly the school, how then would the make-up of this committee differ from the current school-level P&T committee?  In essence, we would simply be instituting two school-level reviews.  To summarize, first and foremost, we believe this proposed change in policy will result in defeating the repeated insistence of not only campus policies and P&T guidelines but also of the Office of Academic Affairs that P&T should at its foundation be driven by departmental norms as evaluated by disciplinary peer review.  Indeed, IU Policy ACA-38 on Faculty & Librarian Promotions states that “In all cases the candidate’s total record should be assessed by comprehensive and rigorous peer review.” We see the implementation of the proposed changes in primary committee size as working against the spirit of this policy in that in many cases primary committees would be required to pull in faculty outside of the disciplinary context simply in order to meet an arbitrary minimum number of members on the committee.  Beyond that, the logistics and implications of such a change are more than a little problematic.  With a primary committee of at least four faculty members, we simply do not see a problem that is in need of being fixed, and primary committees of this size are in fact more the norm across universities and colleges in the U.S. than the exception.  The faculty of the School of Liberal Arts stand opposed to the proposed reinterpretation of the minimum committee size for P&T deliberations. "

    "body": "  # High honors for Edward Vaughan  Wednesday, May 22, 2019  At this year’s commencement, on May 11, the Indiana University School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI awarded the 2019 Faculty Medal of Academic Distinction to Edward M. Vaughan.  Edward ‘Eddy” Vaughan was a Liberal Arts student who attained a double major in German and Global & International Studies, as well as completed certificates in Chinese Language and Culture and Africana Studies. The Faculty Medal of Academic distinction is given to students who meet strict criteria related to GPA and have demonstrated multi-disciplinary approaches to their studies while actively participating in extracurricular activities. It is the highest honor that the School of Liberal Arts can bestow on a graduating Student.  Eddy was a Loretta Lunsford Scholar, and he was a recipient of the Plater Scholarship since 2015. He earned a Powell scholarship, and was an Olaniyan Scholar whose research focused on German Colonialism in Africa in the early 20th century. Eddy completed all four aspects of the RISE designation, studying abroad in Freiberg Germany, where his aptitude for the language helped him garner a research assistantship (an impressive feat for a non-native speaker). And while Eddy earned many well-deserved awards in his time at IUPUI, his qualifications extend well beyond academic performance. His journey with the School of Liberal Arts was marked significantly by service to the IUPUI Community. He served as a Liberal Arts Ambassador, he held leadership roles in the Chinese Cultural Club, the Undergraduate Student Council, and the Honors College Student Council, and he helped the school put its best foot forward with incoming freshman as part of Orientation Services.  The Faculty Medal of Academic Distinction is a very special award, and when asked what means the most to him about the award, Eddy stated “I was nominated by five faculty members across all of the academic divisions in which I study (International Studies, German, Chinese, and Africana Studies). They all have worked very closely with me during the last four years, and the fact that they all saw me as deserving of such an honor means a lot to me.”  Each of his faculty recommendations made similar notes of what set Eddy apart from many other candidates – he has a strong, natural curiosity that came through in his academic pursuits and his research practices. He cares deeply for the topics and material that he studies and this elevates his scholarship and participation. The faculty that worked closely with Eddy all remarked on how his interest and engagement with often complex material enriched the classrooms and environments in which he participated, elevating not only his work, but the engagement of other students as well.  The future is bright for Eddy who will spend the next few years in Germany, first as a Fulbright scholar working in the English Department at a School in Niedersachsen, and afterwards, as he plans to complete a Master’s Degree in Germany focusing on International Relations and Conflict and Peace Studies. Eddy mentioned that “studying in liberal arts makes it easier for me to look at new opportunities and know that, with my education, I can be flexible and do a variety of different work in many different areas.”  The IU School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI is very proud of Edward M. Vaughan and congratulates him on his exciting new journeys. He is a wonderful example of the power and breadth of a modern liberal arts education. "

    "body": "  ## Creative Brief  While a creative brief is most often associated with preparation for an advertising campaign, being able to address many of the same questions in a creative brief can help when you’re planning a communication or event. Your communication/event/advertisement will be more successful if you have considered the questions below and share the answers with others who are helping you to create communications or plan your event.  Why are we taking action? Provide a simple description of the current business situation and the problem or opportunity we want our communication/event/advertising to address.  What are we trying to achieve? State the objectives of your communication/event/advertisement. If there are several, prioritize them. Objectives need to be realistic and limited to the outcomes the communication/event/advertising itself can achieve.  Who are we talking to? Define our target audience as precisely as possible. Even when the message or event can benefit “anyone and everyone,” it’s more realistic to acknowledge there is a subset of people that will be most interested in the communication/event/advertisement. Where available, use both demographic information and qualitative insights to create a portrait of our audience that reveals who they are on a deeper, more individual level.  What is their unmet need? Identify a goal our audience wants to achieve or a problem they want help solving. Describe their attitudes and pain points around their goal/problem and note any specific challenges or advantages we may have.  What do we want to tell them? State the central message we want to communicate. It should be a single idea, expressed in a single sentence, that highlights our unique solution to the audience’s unmet needs.  Why should they listen to us? Provide key supporting statements or proof points that substantiate our central message and differentiate us from competitors. Be specific about why the audience should care and what the value is to them. Identify functional and emotional benefits we provide.  What do we want them to do? Describe how we want our audience to respond to our communication/event/advertisement. If we have a call to action (CTA), define the next logical step we want them to take and how they’ll be rewarded if they do.  How will we measure success? Identify the key performance indicators (KPIs) we’ll use to measure the outcomes of our communication/event/advertisement.  Where and how are we going to speak to them? Media specifications: specific platforms, channels, placements, and vehicles we’ll use to best reach our target audience. List all deliverables and who’s responsible for execution and production for each. "

Our focus is to understand how older adults who are living alone or with partner maintain their health and social connections. Over fifty older adults were interviewed from March to August 2022. Graduate and undergraduate students spoke with interviewees from all over the state of Indiana. The research team has been working on preliminary analyses and continuing to gain new insights into how older adults experience and use resources within their communities Through Institute for Engaged Learning’s Multidisciplinary Undergraduate Research Institute (MURI) and Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP), seven undergraduate students have had the opportunity to collect and analyze data related to this project. Additionally, funding from the Indiana Arts and Humanities Institute supported the hiring of a graduate student project coordinator. Through these opportunities and resources at IUPUI, students made invaluable contributions to this research and gained important research-related skills. Student-related projects have been featured at the Engaged Learning Showcase and Summer Symposium.

We appreciate the experience, skills and dedication you bring to this position. We offer this handbook as a guide to the many policies, procedures and resources with which you need to be familiar. We hope that it will support you in the important work you do.  updated June 2021   ## Employment Information  Hiring Conditions: Associate faculty teaching assignments are contingent upon enrollment and full- time faculty scheduling needs. Associate faculty can teach no more than 9 credit hours per semester in the IU system.  Salary: For the 2019-20 school year, the associate faculty pay rate is $900 per credit hour taught. Senior Associate Faculty is $990 per credit hour taught.  Payroll: Associate faculty are paid monthly, for a total of five payments per semester.  Paydates can be found at this link: https://fms.iu.edu/payroll/pay-dates/ .  Note: if the last day of the month falls on a weekend or holiday, payday is the Friday before the last day of the month; in addition, the December paycheck is paid on the first working day in January.  You MUST set up a direct deposit to a bank account. Go thorough “ONE” to set up this direct deposit. In ONE, search for “Employee Center” and go to “Payroll & Tax.” Here, you can set up both your direct deposit information and your tax withholding deductions.  [https://fms.iu.edu/payroll/pay-dates/](https://fms.iu.edu/payroll/pay-dates/)  FERPA: The Federal government requires the University to comply with FERPA, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. New faculty members must complete the FERPA tutorial at https://ferpa.iu.edu/responsibilities/index.html , which presents basic information followed by a short quiz. All of the questions must be answered correctly to “pass.” However, if you do answer incorrectly, you will be allowed to see the correct answer and change your response. When you receive confirmation of having taken the FERPA tutorial, please forward it to your department chair or program director.  [https://ferpa.iu.edu/responsibilities/index.html](https://ferpa.iu.edu/responsibilities/index.html)  IUPUI ADA Training for Faculty: IUPUI requires all faculty to complete the ADA training module offered through Canvas.  This training is designed to provide you with the basic principles and core concepts of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the ADA Amendments Acts of 2008 (ADAAA).  This training can be accessed at this link: https://ctl.iupui.edu/Resources/Instructional-Technology/Accessibility  [https://ctl.iupui.edu/Resources/Instructional-Technology/Accessibility](https://ctl.iupui.edu/Resources/Instructional-Technology/Accessibility)  Network ID and University ID : If you are new to the Indiana University system, you will be given a Network ID and a University ID. Your Network ID (or username) is the part of your email address before the @. It will be assigned to you by the university and will be available 2-3 weeks after all payroll forms have been submitted. Your University ID (also called a Principal ID) will also be assigned; it is a 10-digit number that will be on your Crimson Card. Your department or program will communicate with you about how to obtain and access Crimson Cards.  You need to have both these IDs in order to turn in grades.  Parking: http://parking.iupui.edu/  [http://parking.iupui.edu/](http://parking.iupui.edu/)  The School of Liberal Arts adds $245 per semester to each associate faculty member’s pay towards the cost of a parking permit. Once you have your network ID and are active in the IU computer system, you can purchase a parking permit online; search for “parking permit” in ONE. Parking permit designations, space distribution, and lot/garage designations may change from semester to semester, so make sure to familiarize yourself with the current options for parking.  You can also find helpful information on the Parking Services website about motorist assistance, “Safewalk” escort services, and campus shuttles.  (See: https://parking.iupui.edu/ )  [https://parking.iupui.edu/](https://parking.iupui.edu/)  Those with a state-issued handicap license plate or tags are eligible for an IUPUI handicap-parking permit, which may be used in any lot. Applications are available at the Parking Services office (inside the garage at 1004 W Vermont St.)  Crimson Card: https://crimsoncard.iu.edu/about/index.html  [https://crimsoncard.iu.edu/about/index.html](https://crimsoncard.iu.edu/about/index.html)  IUPUI’s student/faculty/staff ID card, called a “Crimson Card”, is available to new associate faculty for no charge.  (It is $25 to replace a lost/stolen or damaged card.) You are not required to have a Crimson Card as an associate faculty member, but it is by far the easiest way to use the School’s photocopiers, and you do need it to check items out from the library. In addition, it offers quite a few benefits and discounts at area restaurants, museums, sporting events, and shops. See the complete list of “Deals and Discounts” on the Crimson Card site. In order to get your Crimson Card as a new IUPUI employee, you will need to have an “active” status in the IU computer system. Your status is active once all new hire paperwork has been completed, submitted and approved, and you have received a University ID number. You can check your faculty status online on the Crimson Card site (click “Check Employee Status”). Once your status is “active”, bring a photo ID to the Crimson Card Office located in the IUPUI Campus Center, Suite 217 to get your Crimson Card.   ## Associate Faculty Resources and Expectations  Basic Expectations:  Associate Faculty Office Suite: Office space for SLA Associate Faculty is located in CA 313. These are cubicle workspaces with a computer, desk, and access to shared photocopier, printer and office supplies. Email assocfac@iupui.edu to request an office space.

Copying and Printing: To print you will choose in_lart_bw1 on iu-ls-prn-pr19.ads.iu.edu as your printer then you may print on any of the machines in the school by swiping your CrimsonCard or using login authentication. There is a copier in CA313 as well as in the locations listed below:  List-serves and e-newsletters : Most departments and programs have at least one list-serve for communicating information to faculty. In addition, IUPUI sends out helpful information in the form of an e-newsletters and other mass email communications. To make sure you receive these communications, check with teamadmn@iupui.edu about list-serves and group email lists to which you should be added.  Health Insurance: At IUPUI, we understand the gravity of the situation regarding lack of health insurance and other benefits for part-time employees. While our long-term goal is for IU to allow health and dental benefits through the University for associate faculty, the Indiana public exchange is currently available at http://www.healthinsurance.org/indiana-state-health-insurance-exchange/  [http://www.healthinsurance.org/indiana-state-health-insurance-exchange/](http://www.healthinsurance.org/indiana-state-health-insurance-exchange/)  Office Hours: In addition to regularly scheduled course meeting times, associate faculty members are expected to hold regular office hours, at least one hour per week for each 3-credit course taught. There is a small conference room inside CA 313 that you can use for private student consultations. Conversations with students are subject to FERPA guidelines; therefore, do NOT hold office hours in public locations such as the Campus Center or Starbucks. Office hours should be stated in your syllabus. In addition, please indicate in your syllabus how you want students to contact you (IUPUI email address or through Canvas) Associate faculty members are expected to respond to student messages in a timely manner.  University Information Technology Services: http://uits.iu.edu/  [http://uits.iu.edu/](http://uits.iu.edu/)  University Information Technology Services (UITS) provides assistance with setting up and managing your University accounts and classroom technology issues and also offers tutorials and training classes on many software systems. The UITS Support Center ( http://uits.iu.edu/) addresses general questions or problems concerning technology.  [http://uits.iu.edu/)](http://uits.iu.edu/)  In addition, Knowledge Base ( http://kb.iu.edu/) is an award-winning database of thousands of answers to questions about computing; it is available to faculty, staff and students.  If you need further assistance, contact techserv@iupui.edu or call (317) 274-2590.  If you are in the classroom and need immediate technology help, call Classroom Technology Support at (317) 274-8400.  Center for Teaching and Learning: http://ctl.iupui.edu/  [http://ctl.iupui.edu/](http://ctl.iupui.edu/)  The IUPUI Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL) was established in 1995 as a partnership among Academic Affairs, UITS, and the University Library. The mission of the CTL is to advance teaching excellence at IUPUI while supporting faculty through a collaborative approach that celebrates and embraces the diversity of our urban research university. The CTL offers a wide array of programs, events, and services that foster innovation and translation of educational research into practice. Visit the CTL’s website for more information, and see http://ctl.iupui.edu/Resources for many practical teaching suggestions.  [http://ctl.iupui.edu/Resources](http://ctl.iupui.edu/Resources)  Learning Management Systems: IU provisioned all courses and enrollments in Canvas. Canvas is the only learning management system used by the University at this time. You can find out more about Canvas and create a practice course at http://next.iu.edu/canvas-platform/index.php .  [http://next.iu.edu/canvas-platform/index.php](http://next.iu.edu/canvas-platform/index.php)  Course Evaluations: All School of Liberal Arts faculty members are required to have their students complete evaluation forms at the end of each semester. Course evaluations are electronic and will appear in your Canvas site on the dates stipulated. Evaluations will close on the last day of regular classes and are not available during final exam week.  Cultural Sensitivity: As is currently the case in many U.S. colleges and universities, IUPUI has a growing international student enrollment. In addition, IUPUI is known as a military-friendly school and has a significant contingent of first-generation, returning, and other non-traditional students. These circumstances significantly increase the diversity of IUPUI’s student body and provide all members of the IUPUI community with the opportunity to increase awareness and understanding of those whose backgrounds, beliefs, and expectations are different from our own. Such diversity can provide associate faculty with ‘teachable moments’ in the classroom, but also may require some flexibility from faculty members.  Emergency Procedures: IU procedures for handling emergency situations can be found at: http://protect.iu.edu/emergency/procedures. Please take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with these responses. Emergency evacuation maps and procedures are posted on each floor of every campus building at the elevators. It is critical that you learn where the exits in your building are located. In the event of a fire, please exit via the stairs and not the elevators. Campus-wide tornado drills are conducted each spring, and compliance is mandatory.  [http://protect.iu.edu/emergency/procedures.](http://protect.iu.edu/emergency/procedures)  To receive emergency alerts via the IU U-Notify system by email, text and/or voice mail, go to: http://protect.iu.edu/emergency/iunotify  [http://protect.iu.edu/emergency/iunotify](http://protect.iu.edu/emergency/iunotify)  Weather Closings: IUPUI does not normally close during adverse weather conditions, although there will be times when certain employees cannot travel to work, may arrive late or may need to leave early. Associate faculty are expected to use their best judgment when traveling to or from work and should not endanger themselves or ignore the statements of local officials. Class cancellations and campus closures will be reported in the local news media and announced via the IU U-Notify system.  Cancelling Class: If you have a personal emergency, are ill, or otherwise cannot get to class when IUPUI classes have not been officially cancelled, you must contact your department chair or program director as soon as possible, as well as contact the Administrative Support Team (Phone: 317-274-2188; E-mail: teamadmn@iupui.edu ) so that a note can be placed on your classroom door. You should also post an Announcement on Canvas and send a message through Canvas to your class roster.   ## Resources for Students  IUPUI offers many resources to help students thrive academically and personally. It is important that you make yourself aware of these resources so that you can council students as appropriate. Sometimes a suggestion from a trusted teacher can make the difference for a student who is struggling academically or emotionally.  University Writing Center : http://liberalarts.iupui.edu/uwc/  [http://liberalarts.iupui.edu/uwc/](http://liberalarts.iupui.edu/uwc/)  The University Writing Center (UWC) is a service available to all IUPUI students, both graduate and undergraduate. Students work one-on-one with consultants (faculty and specially trained students) to improve their writing process and receive constructive feedback on their assignments. The UWC has locations in Cavanaugh and the University Library. Students may schedule up to three 45-minute appointments a week at (317) 274-2049 or https://iupui.mywconline.com ; walk-in appointments are also possible depending on consultant availability.

Mentors can assist students with aspects such as understanding assignments and requirements, brainstorming for topics and main points, developing visual aids and PowerPoints or Prezis, polishing gestures and speech delivery, and reducing speech anxiety. Call (317-278- 7940) or visit (CA001) the Speakers Lab to set up an appointment.  Bepko Learning Center: https://blc.iupui.edu/  [https://blc.iupui.edu/](https://blc.iupui.edu/)  The Bepko Learning Center offers academic mentoring, tutorial support, and online podcasts to assist students in making the most of their educational experience at IUPUI.  Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) : https://studentaffairs.iupui.edu/health/counseling-psychological/index.html  [https://studentaffairs.iupui.edu/health/counseling-psychological/index.html](https://studentaffairs.iupui.edu/health/counseling-psychological/index.html)  CAPS provides IUPUI with mental health services such as group counseling, individual counseling, and medication management. Students can contact CAPS at (317) 274-2548 or capsindy@iupui.edu  Same-day crisis appointments will be arranged for students experiencing suicidal thoughts, having trouble completing daily tasks, or facing an acute stressor that threatens the safety of themselves or others.  The CAPS website offers helpful advice for those concerned about a student: http://studentaffairs.iupui.edu/health-wellness/counseling-psychology/help-others/refer-student.shtml  [http://studentaffairs.iupui.edu/health-wellness/counseling-psychology/help-others/refer-student.shtml](http://studentaffairs.iupui.edu/health-wellness/counseling-psychology/help-others/refer-student.shtml)  Adaptive Educational Services : http://aes.iupui.edu/  [http://aes.iupui.edu/](http://aes.iupui.edu/)  Adaptive Educational Services (AES) coordinates work with students with disabilities in accordance with the 2009 American with Disabilities Act. Their offices are on the first floor of Taylor Hall.  Students who have confirmed disabilities need to be registered with AES before they can receive accommodations. Once registered, the student can expect AES to send notification to professors, asking for appropriate accommodations. These accommodations might take the form of a signer in the classroom for a deaf student, a note taker in the class, handouts with larger print, having additional time for tests, or other accommodations. If a student requires additional time on a test, AES will contact you to arrange for the student to take the test in the AES office.  Student Advocate : https://studentaffairs.iupui.edu/advocacy-resources/index.html  [https://studentaffairs.iupui.edu/advocacy-resources/index.html](https://studentaffairs.iupui.edu/advocacy-resources/index.html)  The Student Advocate guides students in resolving educational, personal, and other barriers toward successful completion of their academic goals, links students with appropriate university and community resources, and collaborates with faculty and staff to assist with addressing student concerns. The Student Advocate Office is located in the Campus Center, Suite 350; students can schedule an appointment online or call (317) 274-4431.   ## Course Materials and Classroom Policies  Syllabi: University policy mandates that an instructor create a detailed syllabus for each section he or she is teaching. A course syllabus can be considered a contract between the instructor and the students. A detailed course syllabus, made available on the first day of class, gives students an immediate sense of what the course will cover, what work is expected of them, and how their performance will be evaluated. Furthermore, a well-prepared course syllabus shows students that you take your teaching seriously.  Many programs and departments require an electronic copy of your syllabus to be provided in a Canvas faculty resource site; check with your department chair or program director about your area’s requirement.  The School of Liberal Arts provides a template for syllabi here: Undergraduate Syllabus Template  In addition, your department or program may provide sample syllabi or templates for your specific course(s).    Academic Misconduct: When confronted with a case of academic misconduct, refer to the University Guidelines, which can be found at (there is a syllabus supplement tab for all Liberal Arts courses in Canvas for the wording of all the following information, and thus is not longer needed in your sylabus-please refer students to the syllabus supplement):  Academic Integrity: Please refer to the IUPUI Student Code of Conduct: http://studentaffairs.iupui.edu/student-rights/student-code/ for information regarding penalties and procedures in cases of academic misconduct: cheating, plagiarism, etc.  [http://studentaffairs.iupui.edu/student-rights/student-code/](http://studentaffairs.iupui.edu/student-rights/student-code/)  Instructors may augment this statement by specifying penalties that may be applied in cases of academic misconduct in their course.  Withdrawals . Students can withdraw from your class without obtaining your signature until about halfway through the semester. Withdrawals should be handled using the Electronic Drop system.  If you see an email that requires your action, please respond right away so students can withdraw from the class.  After that they must obtain your signature on a Schedule Adjustment Form. Poor performance in your course is not considered grounds for late withdrawal.  Administrative Withdrawal: Administrative Withdrawal is a policy administered through the Office of the Registrar and handled through the FLAGS system (see below). The FLAGS system roster will appear in Canvas and ONE at the beginning of the semester, and it is through the FLAGS system that administrative withdrawal occurs. The Administrative Withdrawal Policy is effective for all students enrolled in undergraduate level courses that are at least 6 weeks in duration. Students who miss more than 50% of an undergraduate course meetings and/or required activities during the first 25% of the course duration may be administratively withdrawn from that course unless documentation of contact with their course instructor, academic unit or academic advisor is provided.  Athletic Rosters: Rosters are sent out by the athletic program once or twice a semester to check on attendance, grades, and participation of its scholarship athletes. Each athlete has given permissions for these forms to be completed. Instructors need to fill these out and return them as quickly as possible after receiving them. If you have questions about handling these rosters, see your course coordinator, program director, or department chair.  FLAGS: https://facultystaffcentral.iupui.edu/grades/flags-system.html  [https://facultystaffcentral.iupui.edu/grades/flags-system.html](https://facultystaffcentral.iupui.edu/grades/flags-system.html)  IUPUI’s FLAGS (Fostering Learning, Achievement, and Graduation Success) system gives you a convenient place to report student attendance and class performance. The FLAGS system was developed to support campus efforts to increase student retention and four-year graduation.  FLAGS includes two components: the student engagement roster and the administrative withdrawal roster .  [student engagement roster](https://facultystaffcentral.iupui.edu/grades/flags-system.html#engage)  [administrative withdrawal roster](https://facultystaffcentral.iupui.edu/grades/flags-system.html#admin)  Incompletes: From time to time, students run into trouble at the end of the semester when circumstances prevent them from completing a course on time. The Registrar’s page at https://studentcentral.iupui.edu/grades-progress/incompletes.html indicates considerations for awarding an incomplete. Students can only be given Incompletes if they (a) have completed at least 75% of the work with a passing grade, and (b) have a compelling reason for not being able to complete the balance. Enter a grade of I on the grade report at the end of the semester, and the student will then need to make arrangements with you to complete the work at a later date. After one year, a grade of I will automatically change to an F. Instructors giving an incomplete must do the following:  [https://studentcentral.iupui.edu/grades-progress/incompletes.html](https://studentcentral.iupui.edu/grades-progress/incompletes.html)  [https://ittraining.iu.edu/sis/sis-job-aids/student-records/edocs/egrade-change/Instructor_eGrade_job_aid.pdf](https://ittraining.iu.edu/sis/sis-job-aids/student-records/edocs/egrade-change/Instructor_eGrade_job_aid.pdf)  Behavioral Consultation Team: Occasionally instructors may have a student whose actions make the instructor and/or other students concerned for their safety. If this occurs, instructors need to notify their department chair, program director, or course coordinator and follow the Disruptive Student Policy. All such instances must be taken very seriously and carefully documented. One of the services provided at IUPUI to deal with these issues is the Behavioral Consultation Team (BCT).  The BCT is a campus-wide team that provides consultation, makes recommendations for action, and coordinates campus resources in response to reports of disruptive or concerning behavior displayed by students, staff, or faculty.  Examples of such behavior include:  * All concerns requiring immediate attention (criminal, violent, threatening, or imminent suicidal behavior) should be directed to the University Police at (317) 274-5555.  Individuals wishing to contact the BCT should call (317) 274-4431 and ask to speak with the Chair (Assistant Dean of Students) or Vice-Chair (Director of Student Rights and Responsibilities) of the BCT.

    "body": "  # Christian Nationalism in the United States  Andrew Whitehead    Andrew Whitehead   ### Current Situation  On January 6, 2021 rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol in an effort to postpone the certification of the results of the 2020 presidential election. Mixed in among the crowd were symbols of the Christian faith: signs reading “Jesus Saves,” Christian flags, crosses, “Jesus is my Savior, Trump is my President” flags. After entering the Capitol rioters livestreamed themselves praying and thanking God for the moment. They shared that this was their country, blessed by the Christian God, and they must do everything they can to take it back. It is impossible to make sense of January 6th and its aftermath without considering Christian nationalism. Christian nationalism is the desire to see a particular expression of Christianity fused with American civic life with the government upholding this arrangement is. By the summer of 2022, sitting Congresspeople were adopting the label of “Christian nationalist.” Given the power of religious rhetoric in politics and how it can motivate citizens in a variety of directions, it is important to understand what Christian nationalism is, how it functions, and the threats it poses to social life in the United States.   ### The Project  For the past decade, I have collaborated with other scholars to document the cultural contours of Christian nationalism in the United States. Using large, nationally representative surveys of the American public, qualitative interviews, and participant observation, my award-winning book Taking America Back for God: Christian Nationalism in the United States provides the first empirically supported definition of Christian nationalism, demonstrate the variety of beliefs and behaviors associated with Christian nationalism, and underscore the threats it poses to a pluralistic democratic society and American religion. Dozens of peer-reviewed journal articles further explore and expand upon these findings. My next book, American Idolatry , extends this work to a public audience interested in wrestling with how Christian nationalism and Christianity intersect.  This work lead to being asked to submit expert testimony to the United States House of Representatives Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol. This project also includes consistent interaction with journalists, think-tanks, and polling organizations to better understand Christian nationalism and how it influences public life. Finally, this project includes writing columns for public outlets like TIME Magazine, The Washington Post, and Religion News Service.   ### Humanitarian Impact  This work benefits the American public by empirically outlining an influential cultural framework and how it shapes what Americans believe and how they behave. Religious organizations use our work to help their congregants and fellow-believers to understand political polarization in their midst and how to more faithfully fulfill the dictates of their faith as they understand it. Non-profits use this work to advocate for the separation of church and state to ensure all Americans, whether religious or secular, are viewed as equals and all “truly American.” Those serving in government use our work to understand policy implications and how Christian nationalism can corrode support in pluralistic democracy where all Americans have a say in who we are as a country and where we should go next. Various think-tanks use this work to better understand the security threats facing the United States both at home and abroad.   ### Results / Data  This project has resulted in various results and outcomes. Across several books and dozens of peer-reviewed articles, some shared below, we find Americans who embrace Christian nationalism are more likely to report a strong sense of moral traditionalism based on creating and sustaining social hierarchies; a comfort with authoritarian social control; a desire for strict boundaries around national identity, civic participation, and social belonging that fall along ethno-racial lines; and a populist impulse that inclines Americans toward feelings of victimization, conspiratorial thinking, and suspicion toward “elite” leaders and institutions. As a partial list, we find Christian nationalism inclines Americans to question the reality of racial injustice, oppose COVID-19 precautions, embrace conspiratorial thinking, oppose immigration, embrace anti-Semitism, support voter disenfranchisement, and embrace political violence if they deem it necessary.   ### Featured Media  [3 Threats Christian Nationalism Poses to the United States.](https://time.com/6214724/christian-nationalism-threats-united-states/?fbclid=IwAR1AfptarxmSIYV5ArIB0jgOC3_vUmYPBxWobwWpqIX4SyY9h8PQtsGN01E)  [What is Black History Month in a white Christian nation?](https://religionnews.com/2023/02/09/what-is-black-history-month-in-a-white-christian-nation/)  [Is Christian nationalism growing or declining?

    "body": "  ## Annual Enhancement Review Guidelines  In accordance with the IUPUI Faculty/Librarian Review and Enhancement policy approved at the IUPUI Faculty Council Meeting, May 7, 1998, the School of Liberal Arts adopts the following Guidelines for conducting the annual Enhancement Review of members of the School. In adopting these guidelines, the School of Liberal Arts recognizes that the quality and integrity of academic programs depend upon the performance of individual faculty. SLA as an academic unit has a collective commitment to ensure the ongoing productivity of all its members throughout their academic careers.  The School of Liberal Arts affirms its commitment to the tenure system as a cornerstone of academic life. The process of achieving tenure is arduous and highly competitive. At IUPUI it involves close and continuous scrutiny of a faculty member's progress, with review of the individual's achievements in teaching, research and creative activities and service, at every level from the department faculty to the University trustees. Historically tenure has afforded freedom to investigate, teach, and speak publicly on topics that may be politically or professionally unpopular, a freedom central to the integrity of academic inquiry. The School of Liberal Arts furthers affirms that tenure promotes faculty loyalty to the university and encourages service to the community.  The School of Liberal Arts understands that tenure constitutes a contractual arrangement protecting a faculty member from dismissal except for cause. In the area of performance of duties this has traditionally meant that only demonstrated professional incompetence or gross dereliction of duty constitute grounds for termination. The policies adopted here in no way weaken that assurance. Actions taken, as with all administrative decisions, are subject to usual appeals procedures.  I. ANNUAL REVIEW  Each year the department Chair will review the performance of each faculty member in the areas of teaching, research and creative activities, and service. Reviews will be conducted in accordance with the guidelines and criteria articulated and described by each department, and consistent with the IUPUI Faculty/Librarian Review and Enhancement policy, with the SLA Enhancement Review Guidelines, and with the Principles Guiding Indiana University Faculty/Librarian Salary Policy (University Faculty Council, April 25, 1989). The Annual Review should establish profe ssional development as a goal; should rely upon peer evaluation; should recognize situational differences, contributions to different missions of the Department or School, and the diverse nature of the faculty; should preserve academic freedom; and should protect due process.  Using the SLA Faculty Annual Review Form (Appendix A), the Chair of the department will rate the overall performance of every faculty member as either:  Each department will design its own review process and its own rating system, the outcome of which would advise and allow the Chair to fill out the SLA Faculty Annual Review Form (Appendix A).  A copy of the SLA Faculty Annual Review Form will be provided to the faculty member and, in the event of disagreement, the faculty member will attach, if s/he wishes, a written response to accompany the Faculty Annual Review Form. The rating form (and the faculty's response in the case of disagreement) will be forwarded to the Dean of the School of Liberal Arts in accordance with the timeline in Section V.  If a tenured faculty member receives overall evaluations of unsatisfactory (see Section IV) in two successive years, those evaluations and all supporting materials will be submitted by the Dean to the School Enhancement Review Committee for assessment. The Faculty member under review will be notified by the Dean of the decision and will have an opportunity to present additional materials that may clarify his or her circumstances.  II. ENHANCEMENT REVIEW COMMITTEE  The Enhancement Review Committee will be a standing committee, composed of three faculty members at the Associate Professor level or above elected by the tenured members of the School. Membership on the committee is restricted to faculty members who do not hold administrative appointments at the rank of department chair or above. Membership in the Review Committee will consist of staggered terms of three years. The Enhancement Review Committee will have two functions: (1) to conduct performance evaluations of faculty members voluntarily seeking peer feedback or a change in career focus (Plan A), and (2) to conduct reviews of faculty members receiving overall evaluations of unsatisfactory (see Section IV) in two successive years (Plan B). In both plans the Review Committee will conduct a thorough evaluation of the faculty member and will specify at the end whether the faculty professional productivity falls within one of the following categories:  The Review Committee shall meet at least once annually to review the faculty member's progress. In the case of Plan B, if the progress is not congruent with the specified timelines and benchmarks outlined in the development plan, the Review Committee will forward its recommendation to the Dean who will notify the faculty member of the outcome of the review and remind him/her of the appeal process before proceeding with sanctions.  III. CRITERIA OF EVALUATION  The lines of development that academic careers may take are immensely diverse, and the responsibilities of individual School members may vary greatly. Thus no list of standards for evaluating individual performance can be complete. Criteria by which faculty members may be evaluated at the school level include, but are not limited to, the following:  Teaching:  Research and creative activities:  Service:  IV. UNSATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE  It is to be emphasized that a rating of unsatisfactory is inappropriate unless the performance of a faculty member clearly falls below accepted standards of professional competence or exhibits utter disregard for professional responsibilities. Unsatisfactory performance does not consist, then, in being the lowest-rated teacher in the department, or in simple failure to publish. Rather, it is constituted by inability or unwillingness to perform fundamental duties and by complete absence of intellectual growth and productivity. Given the standards a faculty member must satisfy to qualify for tenure, it is to be expected that such cases will be extremely rare.  In the absence of mitigating circumstances, determination of unsatisfactory performance will involve consideration of total faculty activity in the three areas of teaching, research (or creative activity), and professional and university service including changes in emphases over time. Evaluation will be based on, but not limited to, such factors as:  In general, an unsatisfactory rating in any particular area will be inappropriate as long as a faculty member undertakes his or her duties in that area with reasonable responsibility and good will. Where the performance of a tenured faculty member in a given area is in danger of falling below the level of acceptability, the department should take early action to rectify the problem. Where possible, the faculty member's responsibilities may be adjusted to take account of the situation. In all cases, the resources of the University for improving the performance of the individual should be made fully available to that faculty member.  V. IMPLEMENTATION  Revised, 2-9-00 "

    "body": "  ## FAQs  Q. Now that I’ve received a grant, where is my money? A. For external funding, the money will come to ORA through the awarding agency and they will place it in and set up an account. For internal funding, it will be transferred from the awarding office or center into the account determined to be appropriate by the Fiscal Officer Rick Hanson.  Q. How do I get an account number? What if I need to buy something before I have it? A. ORA will assign one for an external grant; the fiscal officer will determine which account is best for internal funds. For an external grant, an advanced account (formerly known as underwrite) can be requested before the final award is received by IU, so an account can be set up to get to work.  Q. How do I know my grant account number? A. As PI, you will receive an electronic Award Report from workflow@iupui.edu when your externally funded project is fully awarded. The account number is at the top of the first page once you open the document. External grant accounts will start with a 4 or a 5. Internal grant accounts will vary. Some may start with a 2, others may be set up in a designated department sub account, and sometimes the money may be placed directly into your department sub account. Eric Hamilton, Grant Fiscal Specialist, will work with you and our Fiscal Officer, Rick Hanson, to determine the appropriate method.  Q. How do I charge something to my grant account? A. Most of the internal processing systems (purchasing, hiring, payroll) allow a simple placement of the account number into the document to properly charge the account.  Q. What if I need to buy something I can’t charge to my grant account? A. There are other options depending on the item. Eric Hamilton has a credit card to order online supplies or services, etc. Visit or contact Eric!  Q. How do I hire someone onto my grant project? A. You will work with Eric Hamilton to get that done.  Q. If I have a question, who can I call for help? A. You can call Edith Millikan or Eric Hamilton for help at any time. Please see the Faculty-Staff intranet Research home page for contact information.  Q. Where can I find information about budgeting rates such as indirect cost and fringe benefits? A. For more information, visit the IU Rates (Fringe, Facility and Admin) webpage. http://researchadmin.iu.edu/GrantContract/gc-propprep/gcs_rates.html  [http://researchadmin.iu.edu/GrantContract/gc-propprep/gcs_rates.html](http://researchadmin.iu.edu/GrantContract/gc-propprep/gcs_rates.html)  Q. What is the difference between fringe benefits and indirect costs (ICR’s)? A. Fringe benefits are all benefits earned along with salary, such as medical insurance and retirement. They are real costs covered by the School and your department. They don’t show up in your paycheck stub; only the medical insurance and retirement contribution you make appear there. The fringe benefits rates change every July. The ORA website has a link to current fringe rates. Indirect cost rates (aka Facilities & Administration/F&A) are amounts that are written into a grant to recover overhead costs, such as central administration, School administration, utilities, building maintenance, and a host of other expenses.  Q. Do I have to pay for an RA’s tuition and insurance? A. Whether you pay these things is up to you, and potentially the student. You will need to work with your department to determine who is responsible for paying these for a student with an academic appointment.  Q. Are there certain things I can’t charge to my grant? A. Background checks for hiring can never be charged to a grant account. In general, any supplies or services that were not budgeted cannot be paid for by a grant.  Q. If I’m going to travel, who sets that up and how? A. Eric Hamilton can work with you to get you set up in the Travel system, and you will work together to make the needed arrangements.  Q. What happens if I don’t spend all my grant money? A. This depends on both whether it is internally or externally funded, and what the original agreement with the funding agency states. Generally, any unspent funds are returned to the agency (external) or institution/center (internal) that supplied them.  Q. If someone already works for IUPUI, can they work for me too? If so, what are the restrictions? A. This will vary depending on the situation. Please see Eric Hamilton to discuss your specific situation to determine the best and most efficient way to get someone hired.  Q. How can I find out what grants are out there for me to apply to? A. Please visit the Faculty-Staff Intranet Research/Research Development page for links to internal and external funding opportunities.  Q. Where is my ICR money? A. ICR’s are distributed biannually depending on expenditures in either the first or second half of the year. They are distributed in mid to late August for January 1 – June 30, and sometime in mid- February for July 1 – December 31.  Q. When is summer salary paid? A. Summer salary is generally paid over 3-4 months in the summer. It is possible in May or August to earn academic year pay as well as summer salary.  Q. What happens to equipment/computer programs I purchased for a grant, once that grant is over? A. This depends on the kind of equipment, but generally it becomes property of IUPUI.  Q. How do I get IRB approval? A. The IRB process is now entirely electronic. For further information, please see the IU Human Subjects and Institutional Review Boards webpage at http://researchcompliance.iu.edu/hso/index.html. Both Edith and Eric can help you with this if needed.  Q. At what point in the process with the SLA Research Support staff get involved? A. The SLA Research Support team members are here to help you with any and every phase of the research project. We are willing to sit down in the beginning to help lay out some ideas so that you can better plan your proposal, as will work closely every step of the way to ensure a smooth project. "

The “liberal” in “liberal arts” doesn’t refer to politics or ideology. It comes from the Latin word liber , which means “free” or “unrestricted.” The Latin phrase liberales artes refers to training of the mind that’s appropriate for a free person.  What you learn in liberal arts teaches you to think freely and helps you become the person you want to be.   #### At least 80% of employers say these skills are very important—and you’ll develop them here   ##### Oral communication   ##### Written communication   ##### Critical/analytical thinking   ##### Working effectively with others in teams   ##### Ethical judgment and decision making   ##### Applying knowledge/skills to the real world  Source: Hart Research Associates for the Association of American Colleges and Universities  [Association of American Colleges and Universities](https://www.aacu.org/)   ### Timeless skills that cross over to any career  Our programs teach you specific knowledge and skills in your area of interest, but they also help you develop abilities you can use in any career.  You’ll use your liberal arts expertise in your first job. Your last job. And every job in between. (And if you’re like most of today’s college grads, you’ll have lots of jobs in between.) That makes a liberal arts education very practical—and it makes you very valuable.   #### More liberal arts skills that will help you innovate and lead   ##### Problem solving   ##### Global awareness   ##### Interpersonal skills   ##### Understanding other cultures   ##### Seeing different viewpoints   ##### Researching and interpreting information   ### Liberal arts complements any field of study  Scientists and engineers need to communicate complex ideas. Businesspeople need to understand international markets. Public officials need to translate research into policy.  Liberal arts grads have become hot commodities in Silicon Valley—because technical abilities only go so far, and the best products and services are infused with an understanding of people, culture, and the world.  It’s in Apple’s DNA that technology alone is not enough—that it’s technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields us the result that makes our heart sing.   ### Become a better person  Studying liberal arts teaches you a lot about yourself. You’ll discover what you value. What inspires you. You’ll cultivate a sense of curiosity that will fuel a lifetime of explorations. You’ll have all the tools to become the best person you can be.   ### Make a difference  Your liberal arts education will empower you to do good in the world. By learning to understand other cultures, to view issues and ideas from many perspectives, and to work with people from different places and backgrounds, you’ll become a more informed citizen who can help people and generate change.   ### More evidence in favor of a liberal arts education  91% of employers value job candidates’ ability to communicate, think critically, and solve problems more than their major (Hart Research Associates)  92% of our 2016 graduates reported positive career outcomes (IUPUI First Destination Survey)  55% of professional leaders in 30 countries hold a social sciences or humanities degree (British Council)  4 job changes in your first 10 years after college is common (LinkedIn)   ### Put liberal arts to work for you  [Plan a visit](https://liberalarts.iupui.edu/admissions/visit.html)  [Learn how to apply](https://liberalarts.iupui.edu/admissions/apply/index.html) "

The program enabled him to earn a second degree in German—which came in handy when he interned at Bosch Engineering Group in Germany.  During his software engineering internship, he got experience with vehicle calibrations and the code and logic functions involved in operating vehicles. Now he’s a thermal and fluid science engineer at Cummins, where he performs engine emissions testing and analyzes the results. And he’s still using his liberal arts training, which has helped him communicate with German colleagues.   ### 100+ options for what to study "

Created in 2016, the award recognizes a member of the IUPUI faculty, staff or administration who goes above and beyond to ensure that students with disabilities enjoy all possible benefits of campus life.  This year’s award went to Ronald Sandwina, senior lecturer in the department of communication studies and director of the IUPUI general studies program. Both roles fall within the IU School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI.  Sandwina was honored for helping Adaptive Educational Services (AES) students achieve their academic goals. As a mentor, Sandwina has offered encouragement and guidance. He’s credited with helping many AES students persist through college and graduate.  “Professor Sandwina’s efforts are an example to us all,” said Thomas J. Davis, dean of the School for Liberal Arts at IUPUI. “We appreciate the energy and dedication he brings to helping all IUPUI students succeed and feel welcomed on campus.”  The award was presented at the annual IUPUI Diversity Reception on Wed., Sept. 20, at Sahm’s Atrium in One America Square. Sandwina’s name will be added to the Advocates for Equity in Accessibility Awards wall plaque in Taylor Hall. The plaque is located near the bust of Joseph Taylor, IUPUI’s first dean of Liberal Arts, who was the father of a special needs child and strong supporter of IUPUI’s Adaptive Educational Services and its students.

    "body": "  # $1.2 M Lilly Endowment grant to fund research about how parents in the Episcopal Diocese of Indianapolis share their faith and values with their children  Thursday, August 24, 2023  The IU School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI is proud to announce that a new $1.2 million grant from Lilly Endowment Inc. to Indiana University Foundation will fund research about the hopes, challenges, and experiences of parents in the Episcopal Diocese of Indianapolis in passing on their religious faith to their children.  Lilly Endowment is supporting the research through its Christian Parenting and Caregiving Initiative. The aim of the national initiative is to help parents and caregivers share their faith and values with their children.  The project is a collaboration between researchers at the Center for the Study of Religion and American Culture at IUPUI and the Episcopal Diocese of Indianapolis , which includes 47 congregations in central and southern Indiana.  [Center for the Study of Religion and American Culture at IUPUI](https://raac.iupui.edu/)  [Episcopal Diocese of Indianapolis](https://indydio.org/)  Dr. Brian Steensland , sociology professor in the IU School of Liberal Arts and the project’s lead investigator, will assemble a research team that will interview parents in the diocese about the experience of raising children within their faith tradition. Topics will include parents’ aspirations, challenges, and needs.  [Dr. Brian Steensland](https://liberalarts.iupui.edu/departments/sociology/directory/brian-steensland/)  “National studies show that parents play the primary role in their children’s spiritual development,” notes Steensland. “But often, parents feel poorly equipped to share their faith and help their children grow spiritually. Many parents and congregational leaders see spiritual formation as something that happens for the most part inside churches and within other formal religious settings. With this project we want to learn how parents can grow in their confidence to share faith with their children. We also want to learn how congregations can encourage parents and equip them to be successful in sharing their faith both in their family’s daily activities and through church programs.”  Based on findings from the research phase of the project, the diocese will develop resources, host speakers, and organize events for parents. “One way that the present is different from the past, even a generation ago,” continues Steensland, “is that today parents raise their children in increasingly pluralistic and diverse religious and cultural contexts. There are many religious and worldview options, and an increasing number of individuals are choosing not to commit to any of them. Better equipping parents to navigate their role in shaping their children’s faith commitments in these dynamic social and cultural contexts is one of the goals of the project.”  Heather Kenison, Diocesan Youth Minister for the Episcopal Diocese of Indianapolis, is thrilled to partner with this project. “Parents have traditionally relied on youth group as the place that their teenagers learn about faith,” Kenison shares. “Churches have an average of 40 hours with teenagers each year, but parents have 3,000 hours of potential influence. Perhaps the holiest thing our diocese can do for youth ministry is give parents the tools to have faith conversations at home.”  Indiana University is one of 77 organizations that are receiving grants through this competitive round of the Christian Parenting initiative. Reflecting the diversity of Christianity in the United States, the projects being funded represent mainline Protestant, evangelical, Catholic, Orthodox Christian and Pentecostal faith communities. Many of the projects are rooted in Black church, Hispanic and Asian Christian traditions.  “We’ve heard from many parents who are seeking to nurture the spiritual lives of their children, especially in their daily activities, and looking to churches and other faith-based organizations for support,” said Christopher L. Coble, Lilly Endowment’s vice president for religion. “The thoughtful and creative organizations that received grants in this initiative are embracing the important role that families have in shaping the religious development of children and are working collaboratively with others to launch programs to assist parents and caregivers with this task.”  Lilly Endowment launched the Christian Parenting and Caregiving Initiative in 2022 because of its interest in supporting efforts to help individuals and families from diverse Christian communities live out their faith fully and well passing on a vibrant faith to a new generation.  About Lilly Endowment Inc.  Lilly Endowment Inc. is a private foundation created in 1937 by J.K. Lilly Sr. and his sons Eli and J.K. Jr. through gifts of stock in their pharmaceutical business, Eli Lilly and Company. While those gifts remain the financial bedrock of the Endowment, it is a separate entity from the company, with a distinct governing board, staff and location. In keeping with the founders’ wishes, the Endowment supports the causes of community development, education and religion and maintains a special commitment to its hometown, Indianapolis, and home state, Indiana. A principal aim of the Endowment’s religion grantmaking is to deepen and enrich the lives of Christians in the United States, primarily by seeking out and supporting efforts that enhance the vitality of congregations and strengthen the pastoral and lay leadership of Christian communities. The Endowment also seeks to improve public understanding of diverse religious traditions by supporting fair and accurate portrayals of the role religion plays in the United States and across the globe.

    "body": "  # IUPUI Freedom School readies for summer session  Tuesday, April 25, 2023  For six weeks this summer, interns from IUPUI will serve as instructors and organizers to host a Freedom School, a free literacy-based summer program to immerse children in the enjoyment of reading and learning, in/for the Indianapolis community. This high-energy, interactive academic and mentoring program is designed to nurture the development of positive Black and Brown identities in students while enhancing children’s reading skills and strengthening their academic performance.  The IUPUI Freedom School and will serve 50 Indianapolis-area students and is sponsored by the Center for Africana Studies and Culture in the IU School of Liberal Arts and the IU School of Education as part of a national initiative developed by the Children’s Defense Fund (CDF)  “We are excited to expand our reach into the community again this year, it will be IUPUI’s fifth and we are very proud of the achievement,” said Dr. Les Etienne , founding director of the IU School of Liberal Arts Center for Africana Studies and Culture and director of the Africana Studies Program. “We are also proud that IUPUI students, serving as interns who will lead the structured reading program aimed at empowering literacy in our community.”  [Dr. Les Etienne](https://liberalarts.iupui.edu/programs/africana-studies/directory/leslie-kenneth-etienne/)    For graduate student and IUPUI Freedom School Site Coordinator Khrisma McMurray, there is nothing more gratifying than seeing the look on a child’s face when they read a book. McMurray is pursuing a master’s in Library and Information Science and has been working with the IUPUI Freedom Schools since 2018, when she was just an 18 year-old freshman.  “I participate in Freedom Schools because I am passionate about battling illiteracy in marginalized communities. I believe one of the leading causes of Black and Brown scholars having low literacy rates and not finding enjoyment in reading stems from the lack of books they receive that mirror their skin color and experiences,” said McMurray.  McMurray will be working alongside project director Montayha Adams, who is a double IUPUI graduate in education (M.S.) and Africana Studies (B.A.), and six “Servant Leader Interns” (SLIs). The Service Leader Interns guide the scholars through the reading curriculum and STEM- or art-related activities, as well as discussion and education about social justice issues.  “My favorite part of a Freedom School day is that the young scholars take home a book to build their at-home library at the end of the week,” McMurray said. “To put it plainly, a typical day for a scholar is educational, energizing, and empowering.”   ### Educational, energizing, and empowering  Each day the scholars begin by gathering for “Harambee,” Kiswahili for “let’s pull together” — an opening forum featuring motivational songs, inspirational cheers, and chants. Harambee combines community, music, mindfulness, and spelling to energize and prepare scholars for the day ahead.  Scholars then move into a classroom setting for their Integrated Reading Curriculum (IRC). The SLIs guide them with a focus on social advocacy, self-esteem, and dreams. Afternoons consist of various activities designed around the unique interests and skills of the SLIs. These are rare opportunities for hands-on experiences ranging from art to STEM to social action to nutrition — very different from their academic activities during the regular school year.  “One thing that I hope scholars take away from their time in Freedom Schools is the knowledge that they can make a difference and be all they aspire to become,” beamed McMurray.  Etienne adds, “the most rewarding feeling is knowing that after attending IUPUI Freedom School, students return to school in the fall with a new excitement about reading, a more positive self-esteem, and newfound skills for daily positive social interaction in their everyday living and learning.”   ### Be a Servant Leader  SLIs teach the Freedom School’s Integrated Reading Curriculum, highlighting multicultural stories that hit on one of our six weekly themes: Making a Difference in My Self, Family, Community, Country, World, and With Hope, Education & Action.  “For IUPUI students who are going to be working in public service or as educators, teaching in the Freedom School offers a first-hand opportunity to experience what it is like to do anti-racist, social justice, and critical pedagogical work with the scholars,” says Etienne.  If you are an IUPUI student and would like to become involved with the IUPUI Freedom School or serve as a Servant Leader Intern next year (2024), please contact Dr. Etienne .  The IUPUI Freedom School is made possible through funding from a $200,000 Indianapolis African American Quality of Life Initiative grant award from the National Urban League .

    "body": "  # Improv(ing) science communication at IUPUI  By: Krista Hoffmann-Longtin, PhD  Saturday, October 28, 2017  Communication seems like second nature for some scientists. Experts like Bill Nye, Neil Degrasse Tyson, and Carl Sagan regularly appear on television and have active Twitter feeds, designed to make science accessible to the average citizen.  However, for most scientists and physicians, communication is not a part of their training - until now, that is. Communication faculty like me are working with researchers in the IUPUI School of Science and IU School of Medicine to communicate more effectively with the lay public. Since early 2015, nearly 100 faculty, residents, and Ph.D. students have participated in our workshops and programs designed to build relationships and empathize with the audience, regardless of their area of expertise.  [IUPUI School of Science](http://science.iupui.edu/)  [IU School of Medicine](http://medicine.iu.edu/)  This unique intervention, called \"applied improvisation,\" uses the techniques of improvisational theater to solve problems in other contexts. In the case of science communication, simply delivering a speech with more flair or better slides will not improve the communication gap with the public. Scientific experts need the ability to \"position take\" with their audiences. They need the skills of empathetic imagination, an ability to think like their audience, and responsiveness to an audience's needs and interests.  Our goal is not to make our participants funny. Rather, our workshops help scientists connect to their audience through building relationships and understanding. This training is offered through IU's affiliation with the Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science at Stonybrook University in New York. The three workshop series includes: \"Improv for Scientists,\" \"Distilling Your Message,\" and \"Media Training.\" Each workshop uses a series of games and activities to teach participants how to listen closely, use storytelling and metaphor to increase understanding, and speak in accessible language. The workshop facilitators are trained in scientific writing, public speaking, and theater.  [Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science](http://www.centerforcommunicatingscience.org/)  Rather than scripting presentations word-for-word, we teach our participants to be responsive and work together with their audience to build shared understanding. Reframing communication as a collaborative process helps scientists address the curse of knowledge, by which experts easily forget the time when they were novices in their field. Instead, communication theory and applied improvisation emphasize communication partnerships that equalize the power differentials between expert and public.  The response to the workshops and programs have been overwhelmingly positive. Our participants have gone on to be interviewed on WFYI and participate in the national three-minute thesis competition. In addition to the three workshop series, we have two exciting projects in the works. First, we are creating a graduate minor in communicating science, funded by the IUPUI Center for Teaching and Learning. We are also using these techniques to train pediatric residents to communicate more effectively with their patients and their families. Participants in both of these programs will have an opportunity to test out their new skills with community science events and local school groups. "

    "body": "  # Three liberal arts alumni recognized at the IUPUI Alumni Leaders Dinner  Tuesday, September 26, 2023  The IU School of Liberal Arts annual alumni awards were presented on campus last week during the 2023 IUPUI Alumni Leaders Dinner. Tory Schendel-Vyvoda, David Girton, and Etta Ward have distinguished themselves professionally and have exhibited exceptional service to the School, IUPUI, IU, and our local community. The Indiana University Alumni Association (IUAA) shared appreciation for the alumni and volunteer leaders for their gifts of time, talent, and treasure to the IUPUI campus and its alumni programs.   ### Career Achievement Award  Given for outstanding accomplishments in their professions and in service to the school, IUPUI, and the Indianapolis community, Tory Schendel-Vyvoda , was honored with the IU School of Liberal Arts Career Achievement Award.  Tory has built an impressive career as a cultural heritage professional who has distinguished herself as a curator, author, and lecturer. Tory completed her BA with distinction in German and an Individualized Major that combined Art History and Museum Studies, while minoring in Classical Studies and Global & International Studies in 2014. She went on and received her M.A. in Museum Studies from John Hopkins University and is currently pursuing her Ph.D. at the Institute of Doctoral Studies in Visual Art. Tory Schendel-Vyvoda currently serves as the curator for the Evansville African American Museum where she has amplified the voices of the local Black community be reevaluating how the museum plans and executes exhibitions, working with descendant community to rebuild local Black pride, and she has cultivated a donor base to fund the mission of the museum.  Prior to the Evansville African American Museum, Tory had a four-year appointment as the Virginia G. Schroeder Curator of Art at the Evansville Museum of Arts, History, & Science where she created an international internship program, conducted original research, and facilitated the creation of the institution’s policies and procedures for the care of the museum’s collection based on best practices and accepted professional standards.  Last year, Tory realized a long-term dream of hers to teach at Harlaxton College in Grantham, England as an appointed visiting faculty member where she taught art history and museum studies, as well as assisted with the Harlaxton Field School, which was created in April 2022 and had its first archeological excavation on the grounds of its overseas study abroad center, which is housed in an exquisite, 19th-century Victorian manor located in the countryside of Lincolnshire, England near the town of Grantham.  Tory is also an adjunct instructor in health equity for the University of Evansville and is also an Art Collection Research at the University of Southern Indiana in Evansville, where she researches and documents the John M. Lawrence Medieval Manuscript Collection and the Michael and Patricia Aakuhs Cultural Heritage Collection. Tory was featured in two PBS documentaries for her research on Evansville’s Black History and is Smithsonian certified for completing the National Museum of African American History and Culture’s Ethical Interpretation Workshop.  In addition to her research as a curator, Tory has independently published seven peer-reviewed articles on topics of community curation, photogrammetry, and art history. Her research has been presented nationally and internationally. This past summer, Tory studied in the United Kingdom through the Open Palace Programme Fellowship in Cultural Heritage to further her research endeavors.   ### Distinguished Alumni Award  The Distinguished Alumni Award is the School of Liberal Arts’ highest honor. Etta Ward is recognized this year as an alumnus who has displayed an enduring excellence in her field while continuing extraordinary service to Indiana University and IUPUI.  Etta has a remarkable skill set and a caring nature that nurtures the people she interacts with and encourages them to become the best person they can be. Etta was instrumental in rebuilding a strong and thriving Liberal Arts alumni board that has built a core relationship between the board and the school. For most of you that know Etta from her work on campus, you know that Etta has built an impressive body of work around effective mentorship – especially for underrepresented and minoritized populations. She promotes competency-based and culturally aware mentoring strategies that bolster inclusive mentoring cultures and views all of this work as her professional calling. She values opportunities to pay it forward by sharing her insights and passion with diverse audiences from all career stages, disciplines, and professions. She has developed a series of programs that help foster welcoming and inclusive environments. Etta serves as a DEI strategist and an expert in mentorship. She embodies hard work, perseverance, and excellence.  Etta received her Associate of Arts in Arts and Humanities in 1992, her Bachelor of Arts in English in 1995, and her Master of Arts in Philanthropic Studies in 20008.  The IU School of Liberal Arts honors and recognizes Etta Ward with the Liberal Arts Distinguished Alumni Award because of Etta’s lifelong dedication to service, her commitment, loyalty, and passion for the IU School of Liberal Arts in Indianapolis and IU’s alumni community.  When her term as board president ended, Etta was elected to the IU Alumni Association Executive Council, where she plays a pivotal role in diversity, equity, and inclusion and strategic approach to alumni engagement.   ### Alumni Leadership Award  The IU School of Liberal Arts gave a special Alumni Leadership Award this year to honor and recognize David Girton for his generosity of his time, talent, and treasure to the community, exampled by the creation of The Indiana Project, a program that prepares minority students in colleges and universities across Indiana for employment opportunities in the financial and securities industry.  David received his B.A. in Economics in 2007 from the IU School of Liberal Arts. David possesses over 30 years of experience in the financial services industry, where he specializes in retail brokerage, municipal finance, and institutional trading. Throughout his career, David has diversified his skillsets and actively co-managed several municipal transactions including water, sewer, educational facilities, airports, and stadiums. In 2010, David founded the Liger Financial & Trustee Education conference that brings together trustees, plan sponsors, and money managers from all over the United States to share knowledge, network, and collaborate with one another.  David has served on several corporate and civic boards. He currently serves on the Washington Alliance Capital Board of Directors and the Indiana Public Retirement System (INPRS) Review Committee. David previously served two consecutive terms on the Indianapolis Public School Board. David generously gives of his time, talent, and treasure to the community. He has a charismatic appeal, authenticity, and a drive to serve others.  David has been a well spring source of inspiration and invaluable business guidance to many in his industry. David astutely combines perseverance with resilience with his authentic drive to serve others. Those attributes combined with his passion to leave a powerful legacy are the ingredients and recipe that has powered the launch and rapid success of The Indiana Project. Through vast amount of grit, patience, and ingenuity, David marshalled the resources necessary to create The Indiana Project, which is a program that prepares minority students in many of the colleges and universities across Indiana for the vast economic opportunities in the securities industry. Through David’s tenacity and vision, countless numbers of Indiana youth will have the opportunity to forge a path in the investment management industry and impact the world of finance, as David continues to do. Through The Indiana Project, minority students are exposed to various roles and careers in securities and gain the skills and competencies necessary to be competitive in the financial industry. There’s no cost for the students or the colleges and universities that participate in The Indiana Project. The inaugural class will begin in November 2023 with 25 students. There were 20 IUPUI students who participated in The Indiana Project in February. David loves to share his knowledge of the industry to help others get involved and have the knowledge and skills to be successful. David wants to increase the number of minorities that are successful in the financial industry and created The Indiana Project to help realize his vision. His vision has become a reality and has gotten bigger than he could have imagined.  Tory Schendel-Vyvoda, Etta Ward, and David Girton are all shining examples of the power of a liberal arts education. The IU School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI, the IU Alumni Association, and the entire IUPUI community congratulates them on their achievements and commitments to making the world a better place to live, work, and be in.

    "body": "  # IUPUI religious studies professor named editor of Journal of the American Academy of Religion  Thursday, August 17, 2017  INDIANAPOLIS -- Andrea Jain , an associate professor of religious studies in the Indiana University School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI, has been appointed editor of the prestigious Journal of the American Academy of Religion.  [Andrea Jain](https://liberalarts.iupui.edu/about/directory/jain-andrea-r.html)  With around 9,000 members, the American Academy of Religion is the largest organization of religious studies scholars in the world, and its quarterly journal is the most prestigious in the field.  Jain is a leading scholar of South Asian religions and yoga studies. Her 2014 book, \"Selling Yoga: From Counterculture to Pop Culture,\" was published by Oxford University Press and is a top seller in the field of comparative religions. She has co-chaired the Yoga in Theory and Practice unit of the American Academy of Religion, and her work is featured regularly in newspapers, magazines and the scholarly blog Religion Dispatches.  \"Since arriving at IUPUI, professor Jain has exemplified the religious studies department's commitments to research excellence and public engagement,\" said David Craig, chair of the IUPUI religious studies department. \"She is an ideal choice to lead the Journal of the American Academy of Religion in new scholarly directions and to ensure its broader public relevance for understanding the importance of diverse religions to social, political and economic events and the lives of individuals and communities around the globe.\"  Jain joined the faculty in the School of Liberal Arts in 2010 after receiving her Ph.D. from Rice University. Her areas of interest include contemporary spirituality and the history of modern yoga; the yoga industry's relationship to capitalism and consumer culture; the intersections of gender, sexuality and yoga; religion and politics in contemporary society; and methods and theories in the study of religion.  \"I am honored to serve as editor of such an important journal and look forward to helping share the work of colleagues around the world while fostering important conversations,\" Jain said. \"I am also grateful to work with so many talented scholars at IUPUI, all of whom have made our department a valuable asset to the campus and to the field of religious studies.\"  The IUPUI religious studies department will serve as the journal's editorial office, which is also noteworthy for IUPUI, the School of Liberal Arts and the department.  The Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research at IUPUI has allowed release time for Jain's work as editor, while the Office of the Vice President for Research at Indiana University is contributing funding for two IU Bloomington graduate students to serve as editorial assistants.  \"These collaborative investments are foundational to the first-rate humanities scholarship recognized by professor Jain's selection as editor of the Journal of the American Academy of Religion,\" said Thomas J. Davis, dean of the School of Liberal Arts. \"The journal will continue to be a key publication in religious studies, and we're delighted that IUPUI will have such a significant role.\"  A celebration of Jain's appointment, in conjunction with Indiana Humanities, will take place from 4 to 5 p.m. Oct. 10 in Room 409 of the IUPUI Campus Center. IUPUI Executive Vice Chancellor and Chief Academic Officer Kathy Johnson will speak along with Davis, while Jain will speak about her vision for the journal and for humanities research at IUPUI. "

    "body": "  # The Invisible Art of Literary Editing  Sarah Layden (IUPUI) and Bryan Furuness (Butler University)  April, 2023  Sarah Layden   ### Current Situation  Editing is the invisible art. When it’s done well, the reader doesn’t notice the editor’s work, though you can bet the reader will notice a lack of editing. Good editors work behind the scenes, putting writers and their words at center stage. Great editors deliberately avoid the spotlight. But all this invisibility makes editing a hard craft to learn. How can you figure out what you can’t see? That was a driving question in considering the best ways to teach Literary Editing and Publishing to undergraduate students. At IUPUI, students in the course serve as apprentices to work on the campus literary magazine, genesis. At Butler University, a similar course trains the staff of the literary magazine Manuscripts.  No one textbook satisfied the many topics we wanted to cover in a given semester, and we found there was a lack of transparency surrounding the ways that editors work. We wanted to create more visibility and equity for apprentice editors learning the craft. That is the aim of the book The Invisible Art of Literary Editing: to pull back the curtain on the editing process, to make the invisible visible, and to demystify the editing process.   ### Humanitarian Impact  In the years of developing this textbook, we beta-tested the material in our own classes and revised based on changing practices and technologies in the field, as well as student feedback. We also shared the book as a PDF with other college instructors in exchange for feedback on its utility in their classes. This helped us further shape and revise the material, which includes useful case studies that show marked-up manuscripts in various stages of the publication process.   ### Results / Data   ### Featured Media  [How Do You Know When to Stop Revising?](https://www.pw.org/content/how_do_you_know_when_to_stop_revising)  [Revising with Lenses,](https://brevitymag.com/craft-essays/revising-with-lenses/)   ### Publications  The Invisible Art of Literary Editing , February 2023  [The Invisible Art of Literary Editing](https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/invisible-art-of-literary-editing-9781350296503/#:~:text=Description,transform%20a%20piece%20of%20writing)   ### Research Team   #### Project Leads  Sarah Layden , Assistant Professor of English  [Sarah Layden](https://liberalarts.iupui.edu/programs/writing-program/directory/sarah-layden/)     #### Collaborators  Bryan Furuness, Writer-in-Residence, Butler University "

    "body": "  ## SLA Third Year Review Procedures  All non-tenured, tenure-track faculty members in SLA (with the exceptions noted below) are required to undergo a school-level review in their third year. The term \"third year\" normally refers to the faculty member's third year of employment. However, people who enter with one year of credit toward tenure are in their \"third year\" in their second year of employment, and people who enter with two years of credit toward tenure are in their \"third year\" in their first year of employment. Those who enter either with tenure or with more than two years of credit toward tenure are exempt from the third year review.  Procedures:  In the spring of each year (usually in early March), the notice of reappointment for non-tenured faculty is due in the Dean's Office. On that due date chairs will also submit, separately from the reappointment materials, the following items to the Dean*:  Four copies and the original will be submitted to the Dean. (A copy should be given to the candidate as well.) The original will remain with the Dean; the four copies will be passed on (by the Dean's Office) to the SLA Promotion & Tenure Committee.  The P&T Committee will provide an assessment of progress toward tenure and promotion, taking into account the candidate's intended area of excellence or the candidate's intention to come up on the balanced case. It will not provide a tenure decision, a pre-tenure decision, or anything of that kind. If the committee detects any problems its assessment should aim at helping the candidate and the candidate's department in their efforts to rectify the problems.  The assessment from the P&T Committee will be addressed to the candidate. The P&T committee will send it to the candidate and send a copy of it to the Dean and to the candidate's chair.  The assessment is to be finished and in the hands of the candidate, the candidate's chair, and the Dean no later than two weeks before the due date of the Faculty Review Checklist. (That checklist is usually due in the Dean's Office at the end of April.) That way, any candidate who wants to react to the assessment will have time to do so before the term ends and the P&T Committee dissolves.  Any response from the candidate should go to the candidate's chair or to the Dean, not directly to the P&T Committee. If necessary the Dean, though not the candidate or the candidate's chair, will consult with the P&T Committee about the candidate's response.  6 November 2000  * The third year review is separate from any other review of the candidate, including the reappointment review. It's due on the same date as that review, but it's not part of that review. This does not mean that the key documents in the third year review, e.g., the primary committee's statement, cannot be substantially the same in content as the corresponding documents in the reappointment review. It's just that the two reviews are separate. One of them, the third year review, ends up in the hands of the P&T committee; the other does not. So it's best to submit the documents for the two reviews in two separate packets. "

    "body": "  ## Liberal Arts Perspectives on Storytelling - Pathway Minor  The Storytelling Pathway Minor in Liberal Arts is a 15-credit program provides students experience in understanding storytelling from a variety of viewpoints, including your own; you will use the concepts and practices of storytelling as a way to understand culture and society, as well as the differing modes of sharing stories in and across different cultures. The ways that stories are made, told, shaped, and produced will factor into your learning experience.  As part of a well-rounded university education, the Liberal Arts play a vital role in students’ lives. Liberal Arts courses allow you to contextualize your experiences and how you fit in the world around you, and to empathize with the experiences of others, understanding those experiences as just as vital and necessary as your own.  Storytelling is the chief means of conveying what it means to be a human being in the world.   ### Prerequisites and Required Courses   #### Required courses (with minimum grades required)  With a minimum grade of C, students will complete 15 credit hours of approved Pathway Minors courses, including:   #### Elective courses for the minor (with minimum grades required)  With a minimum grade of C, students will also complete elective courses including 9 additional credit hours of approved courses from the Introductory Thematic Concentration, Intermediate Thematic Concentration and Advanced Engaged Learning Experience categories.  To ensure a robust interdisciplinary experience, students should not take more than two courses from any one department/program as part of the 15-credit pathway minor.   ### Approved Courses   #### Introductory Thematic Concentration (3 credits)   #### Intermediate Thematic Concentration (3 credits)   #### Advanced Engaged Learning Experience (3 credits)   #### Other Requirements and Options:  [Pathway Minor module](https://iu.instructure.com/enroll/YRXPJN)   ### Additional Information  Students may petition to have any 300-/400-level Liberal Arts elective with a RISE designation and storytelling focus count toward their engaged experience. For example, a student may complete an internship, individual research project, service learning project, or study abroad with a storytelling focus.  Students may petition, either before or after taking a course, to count a course toward the minor. Students will petition the Director of the Liberal Arts Pathways Minors Program. Examples of fitting courses outside of Liberal Arts include: HER-D 304 Drawing/Illustration – Narrative Imagery; HER-H 222 History of American Comics and Graphic Fiction; NEWM-N 202 Digital Storytelling  To learn more details, go to Liberal Arts Perspectives on Storytelling Pathway Minor in the IUPUI Campus Bulletin.

Usage will be context-dependent (e.g., for clarity, brevity, SEO). The information presented here is intended as a quick reference and may not be all-inclusive for every situation.  For additional information, please visit University Communications and Marketing’s Name Use Guide for IU Indianapolis . Please also note, UCM may update these guidelines at any time during the transition to IU Indianapolis from IUPUI.

Depending on the context “Indiana University” may be spelled out or abbreviated as “IU” on first reference. It is abbreviated for brevity’s sake herein.  A special note about using “IUI” with the department/program name:   ## Centers and Institutes  The relationship between centers and institutes and where they are housed should be established on first reference. Depending on the context or medium, “Indiana University” may be spelled out or abbreviated as “IU” on first reference. It is abbreviated for brevity’s sake herein. If managed, administered, or governed by IU Indianapolis (i.e., those that formerly started with “IUPUI” in their name): “IU Indianapolis XYZ Institute”  If managed, administered, or governed by the IU School of Liberal Arts: “XYZ Center at IU School of Liberal Arts in Indianapolis”  Examples: Center for Africana Studies and Culture at the IU School of Liberal Arts in Indianapolis, Center for Religion & American Culture at the IU School of Liberal Arts in Indianapolis, Institute for American Thought at the IU School of Liberal Arts in Indianapolis   ## Degrees  Students who attended classes on the IUPUI campus were considered Indiana University or Purdue University students. Their degrees were conferred by either IU or Purdue, depending on the degree. Degrees were never conferred by IUPUI. All degrees from the IU School of Liberal Arts are granted by Indiana University.  What is most recognizable to people outside the IU system is that the degree is granted by Indiana University, so most graduates will want to prioritize sharing that information. Where it makes sense in text or conversation to note a degree was earned on the Indianapolis campus, then, by all means, graduates may include it.  Here is an example of how a degree would appear on a resume:  Here are examples of how you might refer to your degree in running text:  My undergraduate degree is from Indiana University. I earned a Bachelor of Arts in English.  My graduate degree is from Indiana University. I earned Master of Arts in Public Relations. I attended classes on the Indianapolis campus.  I graduated from Indiana University in Indianapolis with a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy.  Looking for additional brand guidelines or marketing assets?

    "body": "  # School of Liberal Arts honors two of its finest  Saturday, May 16, 2020  As part of this year’s commencement in May, the IU School of Liberal Arts has awarded the 2020 Faculty Medal of Academic Distinction to two of its finest students, Kamna Gupta and Ahmed Abbas.  The Faculty Medal of Academic Distinction is an award given to students who demonstrate multi-disciplinary approaches to their studies while actively participating in extracurricular and community activities. It is the highest honor that the School of Liberal Arts can bestow on a graduating student.  Kamna Gupta, an IUPUI honor’s college student, earned a degree in Medical Humanities and Health Sciences with a minor in Religious Studies. Throughout her IUPUI journey, Kamna held campus-wide leadership roles, serving as the 2019 Associate Executive Director of External Affairs, Regatta Steering Committee, and as Executive Director for the TEDxIUPUI Planning Committee. Kamna was a Bepko scholar and named as a “Top 10 Outstanding IUPUI Student” in 2019.  Emily Beckman, Director and Associate Professor, Medical Humanities and Health Sciences program, said of Ms. Gupta, “[Kamna is] an energetic young woman and a rigorous scholar who has represented the School of Liberal Arts and IUPUI with great integrity and enthusiasm.”  In the summer of 2018, Kamna traveled abroad to the Samoan Islands and devised her own independent research project to observe the practice of local herbal medicine. She chronicled her trip in a paper titled, Herbal Medicine and Western Medical Systems in Samoa , which went on to win the prestigious William H. Schneider Essay Contest in January of 2019. When asked what her future holds, Kamna said “I will be attending Indiana University School of Medicine and hope to eventually provide medical care and support to historically under-served communities”.  Ahmed Abbas earned a double major in Religious Studies and International and Global Studies with minors in Arabic & Islamic Studies and Political Science. He was a recipient of the IUPUI Masarachia Scholarship, and in 2019, the Department of Religious Studies granted Ahmed the Tony Sherrill Up-and-Coming Student Award for bringing his excellent academic work to bear on his engagements with Indianapolis communities.  Professor and Chair, Religious Studies, David Craig said of Abbas, “In the classroom, he draws on ideas, thinkers and examples encountered across his different courses. He also builds on other students' insights and elicits sharing by fellow students who do not have his public confidence.”  Ahmed’s ability to forge intellectual connections carried beyond the class and into the community as he served with the IUPUI Social Justice Education program from 2017 until 2019. He co-led the “Shop Talk” program, which cultivated intimate conversations on a vast array of social topics in order to strengthen student thought on campus. In addition, Ahmed co-led the “SpeakOUT” program, providing a space for students to artistically express their experiences with diversity and inclusion, as well as their social justice commitments.  While Mr. Abbas and Ms. Gupta pursued different academic paths, their respective instructors made very similar observations. Both students possessed an earnest curiosity and a desire to elevate their own scholarship which came through in their academic work. Both Ahmed and Kamna tirelessly pursued engagements with their campus, community, and the world at large.  These students and this award mean a great deal for the IU School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI. Their ability to make connections and bridge academic pursuits with community engagements serve as an exemplary model for students and faculty in the liberal arts.  The School of Liberal Arts is very proud of Kamna Gupta and Ahmed Abbas and congratulates them both on winning the Faculty Medal of Academic Distinction. The future is bright for both of these young scholars, and the School of Liberal Arts is excited to see where their journeys will lead them. They serve as wonderful examples of the power and breadth of a modern liberal arts education. "

    "body": "  ## Major Performance Review and Reappointment of Professors of Practice  I. Description of Responsibilities  Professors of Practice are appointees who have achieved distinction in their fields of practice. They bring unique practical experiences and talents that will benefit students and strengthen the reputation of the School. The main responsibility of Professors of Practice is teaching, although they may be assigned research, creative and service responsibilities associated with their contributions to student development and placement. See IU Policy ACA-19: Regulation of Professor of Practice Appointments .  [IU Policy ACA-19: Regulation of Professor of Practice Appointments](https://policies.iu.edu/policies/aca-19-regulation-professors-practice-appointments/index.html)  II. Major Performance Review and Reappointment  Professors of Practice are initially appointed for three years. Assuming a successful substantive mid-term departmental review in the third year, their contracts are then renewed annually through their seventh year in rank at IU. A major performance review will take place before the end of the seven-year probationary period, and if performance is judged excellent, appointees shall be given long-term renewable contracts of either three year or five-year terms.  Professors of Practice should be reviewed within the scope of their appointment letter.  Criteria for Major Performance Review and Reappointment  1. Teaching  All Professors of Practice seeking reappointment based on a major performance review are evaluated on teaching.  Excellence in teaching may include– but is not limited to –the following:  2. Service  All Professors of Practice are expected to make service contributions, although the extent and nature of these contributions may vary based on initial expectations set forward in each contract of employment.  Satisfactory service contributions may include— but are not limited to —the following:  3. Creative practice and management activity  Professors of Practice may be expected to continue their work as creative artists and practitioners in their chosen fields of practice or to contribute to the management of industry processes. The extent and nature of these contributions will vary based on initial expectations set forward in each contract of employment.  Creative and professional activities and management contributions may include – but are not limited to – the following:  III. Timing  No later than the sixth year as a Professor of Practice, a faculty member will undergo a major performance review in order to receive a long-term contract. Shortened probationary periods may be the result of demonstrated teaching excellence that predates appointment in the School or an exceptional record of teaching, service or creative accomplishments in the School.  Evaluation of a candidate for a long-term Professor of Practice position within the School results in an up or out decision: Faculty either receive a longer-term contract, or they will not be permitted to teach full-time in the School beyond the term of their contract.  Reappointment decisions are made at least one full year in advance (i.e., the decision to renew a contract for a Professor Practice’s fourth year is made during the Professor of Practice’s second year of work). Professor of Practice therefore are guaranteed a full year of employment following a negative performance evaluation (i.e., faculty have voted against reappointment).  The following structure and activities are designed to support a newly hired Professor of Practice:  1. First year  2. Second year  3. Third year  4. Fourth and fifth years  5. Sixth year  Approved by School of Liberal Arts Faculty Assembly on September 15, 2017 "

    "body": "  ## SLA Annual Review Guidelines  IUPUI, including the School of Liberal Arts, has a mandated annual review policy for all faculty (IUPUI Faculty Guide). It is the responsibility of SLA Department Chairs and all SLA faculty (including chairs and faculty in school administrative appointments) to complete the FACULTY ANNUAL REVIEW FORM by the deadline  established each year by the Office of the Dean.  The annual review of SLA faculty members serves multiple purposes, as designated by IU, IUPUI, and School policies and guidelines. These purposes include: • Provide input on progress in the areas of teaching, research (as appropriate) and service, including calling attention to weaknesses as well as strengths in a manner that provides all faculty their rights and privileges (IUPUI Faculty Guide); • Determination of levels of merit pay (IU-policy, School Faculty Work Document); • Review and reappointment of non-tenured faculty, including: lecturers, clinical faculty, academic specialists, research associates (IU-policy, IUPUI Faculty Guide); • Review of tenure-track faculty to evaluate progress toward P&T as well as reappointment (IUPUI P&T Guidelines, IUPUI Faculty Guide); • Recommendations (for tenure-line faculty) of course release for research (School Faculty Work Document); • Recommendation of course release for PhD program support (School Faculty Work Document); • Identification and approval of goals and areas of professional development (School Faculty Annual Review Guidelines, School Enhancement Review Guidelines); • Evaluation of and/or recommendation for redistribution of academic effort (School Faculty Work Document); • Determination of overall satisfactory performance (School Faculty Bylaws, IUPUI Faculty Guide, School Enhancement Review Guidelines).  There are several parts to the annual review, including: • The FACULTY ANNUAL REPORT (submitted online via Digital Measures); • The CHECKLIST, which assures all steps have been completed, as appropriate; • The ANNUAL SUMMARY REVIEW FORM; • The CHAIR’S COMMENTS on the faculty member’s performance; • The FACULTY MEMBER’S PROJECTED ACTIVITIES for the next calendar year (to be attached); • Departmental evaluations of the faculty member (e.g., a review by a department’s primary or annual review committee), when they are done (to be attached). • Indication of whether probationary faculty members are being recommended for reappointment or not. (Note: recommendations for non-reappointment require a review by a committee of at least three members of appropriate rank.)  The annual review of each faculty member is to be conducted in a timely fashion in accord with departmental bylaws/guidelines and following the schedule established annually by the Dean. At a minimum, the annual review will be based primarily but not exclusively on the faculty member’s ANNUAL REPORT for the calendar year immediately preceding. Additional information for an annual review may be supplied by faculty or requested by a chair, appropriate persons in a department, or the Dean. Although the FACULTY ANNUAL REPORT covers the previous calendar year, the annual review may reflect current spring semester activities and note activity in prior years that is relevant to current review.  Tenure-line faculty, by definition, have research expectations as part of their appointment. As indicated in the School Faculty Work Document, “faculty are expected to engage in research/creative activity that leads to publication or some other substantive peer- or otherwise appropriately reviewed product/activity/grant within a meaningful period of time.” In order to receive a course release each year, tenure-line faculty must show they have an active scholarly agenda (as described in the Faculty Work Document). Because active scholars do not necessarily have peer-reviewed products every year, chairs are expected to evaluate scholarly activity over the past few years when making their recommendation for a course release for research/creative activity.  The chair’s brief written assessment should be based on the substance of the FACULTY ANNUAL REPORT and any additional information, as noted above. Written assessments by chairs or other parties must be provided to faculty prior to being forwarded with this form to the Dean (as noted above).  Departments are strongly encouraged to include a peer-review component to the annual review process.  ANNUAL SUMMARY REVIEW FORM The Annual Review Form summarizes the evaluation of the teaching, research (or other creative work), and service of faculty members according to the guidelines below. This form must be completed for every faculty member, including for the chair by a departmentally approved review committee. It should be completed by either the chair (or some other appropriately designated body within the faculty member’s department) and the faculty member, and signed by both. In the event of joint appointments, an ANNUAL REVIEW FORM should be completed following the terms outlined in the Memorandum of Understanding that outlines the terms of the joint appointment.  Each faculty member’s work for the preceding year in each of the areas of research, teaching, and service should be reviewed on the following scale using criteria approved by the department: 3 = Significantly exceeds department expectations 2 = Exceeds department expectations 1 = Meets department expectations 0 = Does not meet department expectations  As noted in the School Faculty Work Document (p. 2), the standard distribution of academic effort for tenure-line faculty is forty percent (40%) research, forty percent (40%) teaching, and twenty percent (20%) service. This distribution may have some variability depending on the focus of scholarship (research, teaching, and/or service) and disciplinary expectations, or as a result of administrative or other appointments. The standard distribution of academic effort for lecturer-line faculty is eighty percent (80%) teaching and twenty percent (20%) service. The distribution of academic effort for faculty in other appointments (e.g., clinical, research specialists) is dependent on the specific appointment and is determined at the time of (re)appointment.  Each department is expected to have clearly articulated criteria for evaluating faculty work as meeting, exceeding, or significantly exceeding department expectations in each of the three areas of teaching, research, and service that are in keeping with the expectations given in the School Faculty Work Document. Using the standard distribution of academic effort for tenure-line faculty as an example, a faculty member who exceeds departmental criteria in teaching (2), significantly exceeds departmental criteria in research (3), and meets departmental criteria in service (1) would receive a Total Evaluation Score of 2.2 [= (2 x 0.4 = 0.8) + (3 x 0.4 = 1.2) + (1 x 0.2 = 0.2)].  EVALUATION OF OVERALL SATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE In exceptional circumstances a faculty member might be found unsatisfactory in one of the three areas of teaching, research, and service, and yet be found satisfactory overall. In such cases, the department chair should justify these findings in her/his comments and refer to department and/or School policies as appropriate.  Unsatisfactory Performance Faculty performance should only be evaluated as overall “unsatisfactory” when there is a clear and documented record of an inability or unwillingness to perform fundamental duties and/or by an absence of intellectual growth and productivity. Determination of overall  unsatisfactory performance should involve consideration of faculty activity in all the areas expected for their appointments; however, in the absence of mitigating circumstances, performance that does not meet expectations in one or more areas of work (teaching, research or service) typically indicates overall unsatisfactory performance.  Where the performance of a tenured faculty member in a given area is in danger of falling below the level of acceptability, the department should take early action to rectify the problem whenever possible. In some instances, the faculty member's responsibilities may be adjusted to take account of the situation, as long as adjustments are in keeping with the expectations outlined in the School Faculty Work Document and approved by the Dean. In all cases, the resources of the University for improving the performance of the individual should be made fully available to that faculty member.  As stated in the IUPUI Faculty/Librarian Review and Enhancement Policy, the School Bylaws, and the School Enhancement Review Guidelines, faculty who receive overall evaluations of “unsatisfactory” in two successive years are to be reviewed by the elected School Enhancement Review Committee.  School Expectations for Overall Satisfactory Performance The Faculty Work Document, approved by the School Faculty Assembly, defines school expectations for performance in each area of faculty work:  Teaching Expectations (pp. 4) “For all faculty members, teaching assignments must balance the school’s need for undergraduate and graduate teaching, and give preference to coverage of courses required for majors as well as courses that meet campus general education core and school competency requirements. At times during a faculty member’s career, these needs may require adjustments in the combination of courses he or she teaches (e.g., with respect to topic, level, frequency of particular offerings, etc.)….  Chairs and directors, in consultation with the Associate Dean for Academic Programs and subject to the approval of the Dean, have the responsibility for creating course schedules, based on curricular requirements and student needs, as well as the authority to assign faculty to teach them, including when (terms, days, times) as well as mode (face-to-face, online, etc.). …  All faculty with teaching assignments are expected to: hold regular office hours (in person or virtually, as appropriate); respond in a timely manner to students; keep current in their fields and with teaching pedagogy; develop syllabi and course requirements that meet department, school, and campus requirements; assess student learning/performance, provide students with regular feedback on their learning/performance, and submit grades and other assessments by posted due dates; and administer and reflect on student course evaluations. When teaching is part of the faculty assignment, effectiveness is an essential criterion for evaluation and advancement. Faculty must demonstrate command of their subject matter, continuous growth in the subject field, and an ability to create and maintain instructional environments to promote student learning. …  All faculty, regardless of appointment or rank, are required to administer student evaluations in every section of every class that is part of their teaching load in every term, including summer sessions.”  Research Expectations (tenure-line faculty) (pp. 7-8) “By definition, tenure-line faculty members have a responsibility, regardless of rank, to pursue and maintain active research and/or creative activity agendas that (a) lead to the regular dissemination of peerreviewed publications/products/activities/exhibits in venues (including print, digital, or visual) appropriate for their research/creative activity, and (b) over time lead to or maintain national and/or international recognition of their scholarship. …  It is neither practicable nor appropriate to impose a strict formula to apply these criteria in judging individual faculty research for purposes of a course release. However, examples of scholarly activity that may warrant a course release might include several journal articles and/or book chapters within the previous five years, a refereed book within the previous five to seven years, or the equivalent level of appropriately reviewed products/activity – including public and applied – disseminated in outlets of appropriate quality.”  Service Expectations (tenure-line faculty) (p. 9) “There are no full-time faculty appointments in the School of Liberal Arts that are exempt from service responsibilities. All full-time faculty have basic service obligations to their departments/programs, the school, and the campus. …  At the department/program level, all faculty are expected to attend regularly and participate in department/program meetings, serve on primary and annual review committees as assigned, and contribute to and provide leadership for other committees (e.g., graduate admissions, curriculum, awards) as appropriate. At the school/campus level, all faculty are expected to attend regularly the Faculty Assembly, serve regularly on committees (if and as appropriate for their rank/appointment), periodically hold leadership roles (e.g., chair) on school and/or campus committees, and attend at least one school/campus-level event each year: Commencement, the Celebration of Scholarship, the Graduating Student Reception, the Chancellor’s Honors Convocation and/or the Taylor Symposium. Chairs should encourage and take note of service performed and functions attended.”    Approved by SLA Faculty Assembly September 15, 2017. "

If the paper is disseminated, acknowledgement of the award is expected.  Criteria:  Papers for this competition should be a minimum of 2,500 words and a maximum of 6,000 words in length. The methodology and content of the submission can reflect those of any discipline. The two key criteria are that the paper addresses the topic of Peace & Global Justice and that it be of a quality that is suitable for submission for review for publication. However, a successful submission cannot yet be published or accepted for publication.  Eligibility:  The award is primarily intended for full-time faculty members of the IU School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI. Students and part-time faculty in the School or an IUPUI faculty member outside of the School may compete for this award if endorsed by a letter of support from a full-time faculty member from the IU School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI. A previous awardee is not eligible to apply again for three years.  Application:  Submit electronically a paper meeting the criteria described above to Thom Upton , by noon of Tuesday, March 19, 2024 .

    "body": "  # Welcoming Raymond Haberski as Associate Dean for Academic Programs  Tuesday, February 08, 2022  The School of Liberal Arts is pleased to highlight Raymond Haberski, Professor of History and Director of American Studies, who recently accepted the Associate Dean for Academic Programs position.  The School of Liberal Arts is ready to reestablish the value of liberal arts education with a fresh direction. Dean Tamela Eitle writes, “The Dean’s office is enthusiastic about the addition of Dr. Ray Haberski to our leadership team. His creativity in the design and implementation of the Ph.D. program in American Studies is the kind of innovative thinking that will help our office collaborate with faculty to think beyond the usual in the School of Liberal Arts.” This transition of leadership coincides with a quick-changing collegiate landscape, perhaps marking the beginning of a new phase for the school.  Responsible for course planning and assessment within the School of Liberal Arts, the Associate Dean works with all programs and departments to “defend the role of Liberal Arts on the campus and in the community.” When asked about his vision for the role, Dr. Haberski honors the examples of his predecessors. He says, “I follow other associate deans of academic programs, who were excellent at these jobs, so my hope is to find new ways to help my colleagues build better, plan more effectively, and showcase the great work they do to the campus and university administrators.”  Dr. Haberski indicates that the school is focusing on growing areas, like Law in Liberal Arts, Medical Humanities, and Medical Sociology. He also plans to build upon the school’s larger departments, including Communication Studies, English, and Economics. “The school simply has a great deal to offer,” he declares.  Dr. Haberski is also the director for the Institute for American Thought (IAT). He plans to step away from this role as he assumes his new position but will remain the director of the American Studies Program, the doctoral program in particular. His work with IAT has “direct relevance to” his hopes for the dean’s office. The faculty talent and the connections that the school has throughout Indianapolis communities are things he believes will benefit students. As a historian, he tends look beyond one event or one person. “Ultimately, people make history,” he says, “we as a group have the ability to shape how we work together as an intellectual force for change for our students and our city.”  When it comes to speaking directly to students Dr. Haberski’s door is open. Eager to help learners develop their own degree path, he encourages anyone and everyone to share their dreams for the future. It might be all too simple these days to get stuck in preset plans and go for obvious options. Haberski says, “I know that it is easy [for students] to Google career paths and course plans but chatting with me about their hopes at IUPUI goes beyond what a search engine can return. I want to be a resource that brings students to our faculty in new and productive ways.” He continues, “Think creatively. Do not settle for a packaged plan of study—be willing to put disciplines and fields together and use as much of the university as you can.” "

    "body": "  ## Sabbatical-like Leave for Senior Lecturers in the IU School of Liberal Arts  All Senior Lecturers are eligible for a sabbatical-like leave after seven years of full-time service in the IU School of Liberal Arts (service as Lecturer counts; six [6] years after completing a sabbatical-like leave senior lecturers are eligible to apply again). In order to assure that programmatic needs are met during the sabbatical-like leave, Senior Lecturers need to work closely with their respective chairs or program directors when applying for a sabbatical-like leave. The Senior Lecturer needs to be supported by the chair or program director for any type of sabbatical-like leave application.  The schedule and school policies and procedures for sabbatical-like leave applications are essentially the same as those for sabbatical leave applications of tenured faculty, except that there is no option for a year­long sabbatical-like leave at half-salary.  Eligible Senior Lecturers on ten-month appointments have the option of being released from any teaching and service responsibilities in either fall or spring semester, always with the proviso that all sabbatical leaves need to be arranged well in advance with the chair or program director, so that the needs of the department can be taken into consideration. All leaves must also have the consent of the dean, but they do not need campus review.  In some cases eligible senior lecturers may opt for teaching twelve (12) credit hours over the course of the academic year, an option for a reduced teaching load that releases the faculty member from service responsibilities for one of the two semesters in the academic year. In effect, all sabbatical-like leaves are for one semester, even in those cases where the teaching load release is distributed over the academic year. Eligible Senior Lecturers need to submit a detailed project proposal to the departmental chair and the Dean’s office of the School of Liberal Arts that is modeled after project proposals required for sabbatical leave applications by tenured faculty (See IUPUI Faculty Handbook, p. 84). Proposals may include (e.g):  Upon completion of the sabbatical-like the Senior Lecturer will submit a written report (modeled on the reports about sabbatical leaves) and will commit to a presentation about the project to colleagues, alumni, students, and staff of the school.  Following the guidelines for sabbatical leaves in the Faculty Handbook, Senior Lecturers pledge to return to their academic duties for at least one academic year immediately following the leave. Should that not occur, they shall reimburse Indiana University for any salary, retirement contributions, and insurance premiums paid during the sabbatical-like leave.  According to the Faculty Handbook regarding sabbatical leaves, “Faculty members enrolled in a managed care health care plan who plan to be out of the Indianapolis area during their sabbatical leave may want to consider enrolling in a PPO Healthcare Plan (Preferred Provider Organization, Administered by Anthem) during the leave period. For managed care plans, coverage outside the service area is limited to emergency care while on sabbatical leave.” "

Emeritus Professor, Media Arts and Science   ### Contact  smannhei@iupui.edu IT 500  [IT 500](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=535+W.+Michigan+St.+Indianapolis+IN+46202-3103)   ### Education   ### Biography  Steve Mannheimer began teaching at the Herron School of Art at IUPUI in 1976. In 1982, while maintaining his teaching duties, he began an 18-year stint as the visual arts writer for The Indianapolis Star. In 1985, and later from 1992-2000, he served as president of the Mid-America College Art Association. He also has been involved in the civic promotion of art, having directed several large-scale public art projects in Indianapolis, including the memorial to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Sen. Robert Kennedy in the city’s King Memorial Park.  [King Memorial Park.](http://kennedykingindy.org/the-park/)  In the summer of 2000, he took a two-year leave of absence from IUPUI to become a full-time employee of Thomson Multimedia, Inc. Within Thomson’s New Media Services division, Mannheimer was part of a multi-disciplinary team developing new media business concepts, strategies and technologies. His team worked in collaboration with other Thomson divisions and other research facilities around the world. Mannheimer’s work at Thomson led to a U.S. patent for an acoustic interface (a system for using non-speech sound cues to navigate large databases), as well as more than 20 patent disclosures filed either individually or as part of the team.  After returning to IUPUI in 2002, Mannheimer joined the Media Arts and Science program in the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering. Since then, his research has focused on improving access to information for the blind and visually impaired. This work has been supported by grants from the Nina Mason Pulliam Charitable Trust, the National Science Foundation, Google Research Awards, the IU President’s International Research Awards and other charitable institutions.  He has presented his research at national and international conferences, including CSUN (California State University – Northridge) Assistive Technology Conference, and the 2018 world conference on Movement and Cognition at Harvard Medical School.   ### Research Interests   ### Related News "

[Dr. Tamela Eitle](https://liberalarts.iupui.edu/departments/staff/directory/tami-eitle/)  [Women’s History Month Recognition Award](https://ofw.iupui.edu/Awards/Womens-History-Month-Awards/)    Liberal Arts economics student Rashi Dhenia , who is double majoring in Computer Engineering in the Purdue School of Engineering and Technology and Quantitative Economics in the IU School of Liberal Arts, was also recognized in the undergraduate student category.  For more than 20 years, these awards have been presented to recognize and celebrate students, faculty, and staff who have demonstrated significant leadership, achievement, advocacy, or service at the campus, community, national, and/or international level in support of gender equity, women’s empowerment, women’s history, or cultures of inclusion.  Dr. Eitle said, “It's humbling to be acknowledged among this year’s honorees as well as to join the long list of other women from the IU School of Liberal Arts that have received this award over the years.”  “I have particularly appreciated Dr. Eitle’s commitment to equity, inclusion, and social justice,” said Kathy E. Johnson, executive vice chancellor for Academic Affairs at IUPUI, who nominated Dr. Eitle for this award. “She is a fierce advocate for individuals from historical marginalized backgrounds, and this thread extends from her scholarly research through her leadership activities. She is deeply committed to advancing women in leadership roles and serves as an active and caring mentor for many women on campus.”  “Dean Eitle has made gender equity within the leadership of the School of Liberal Arts a priority, and she has generated substantial progress toward that goal,” said John F. DiTusa, dean of the Purdue School of Science at IUPUI, who also nominated Dean Eitle. “This has included retaining women faculty that have received offers of employment from other universities as well as hiring women into department chair positions and into staff leadership roles. This work has cultivated a culture of inclusivity within the school and supported the advancement of an inclusive climate more widely at IUPUI.”  Lori Handy, Ph.D., assistant dean for finance and administration for the IU School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI and another of Dean Eitle’s nominators, added, “Since joining IUPUI in early 2021, Dean Eitle has continually advocated for transparency, communication, and collaboration. She is focused on making positive changes even when it might be difficult, and her leadership has had an impact on me and the School.”  In total, five students, seven faculty, and four staff from across IUPUI were selected for recognition this year. The awards were formally presented during a recognition reception held on Wednesday, March 29, 2023, in the Campus Center.

    "body": "  # 25 international educators arrive on campus to study Service-Learning techniques for teaching the English language  Friday, March 03, 2023  The IU School of Liberal Arts International Center for Intercultural Communication (ICIC) is proud to welcome 25 English as foreign language teachers and administrators from 24 different countries to IUPUI for a two-week exchange program beginning March 3 to learn the potential of service-learning for promoting both strong 21st century skills (critical thinking, collaboration, communication, creativity), global awareness, and digital literacy, along with increasing English language skills. The exchange program is sponsored by the United States Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs Office of English Language Programs through the English Access Microscholarship Program. The program is administered by FHI 360 and hosted by IUPUI.  [International Center for Intercultural Communication (ICIC)](https://liberalarts.iupui.edu/centers/icic/)  Faculty from across the IUPUI campus, including the IU School of Liberal Arts, Program for Intensive English, Office of International Affairs, IU School of Education, and the Institute for Engaged Learning are collaborating to teach service-learning academic workshops as part of the “ Using Service-Learning to Teach 21st Century Skills to English Language Learners ” program.  They will share knowledge and practical suggestions, while encouraging discussions for participants to reflect on how service-learning can be used in their settings with their students. Participants will see how service-learning can not only promote language skills and 21st CS, but how when students work collaboratively with their community and with global partners, via technology, it can go further to address world needs, such as UN Sustainable Development Goals .  [UN Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/)  “The UN Sustainable Development Goals provide us with an extraordinary framework for understanding that we need to work across boundaries to ensure a more sustainable world for future generations”, said Hilary Kahn, Associate Vice Chancellor for International Affairs, IUPUI and Associate Vice President for International Affairs, Indiana University. “They also draw our attention, and this is especially important for educators, to the importance of navigating local and global contexts in the development of globally responsible citizens.”  Participants will also visit area schools and non-profit organizations that use service-learning approaches to education and will meet students – both K-12 and higher ed – who are growing their skill sets and language competencies, as well as serving their communities, through service-learning. Visits to cultural sites important to Indiana history and culture – the Soldier and Sailors Monument, the World War II Memorial, City Market, and the Indiana Statehouse are also on the agenda.  “It is an honor for ICIC to be chosen by FHI 360 and the Department of State to host this community-engagement / service-learning exchange for our international visitors,” said Ulla Connor, Founding Director, ICIC and Chancellor’s Professor of English. “Throughout our center’s 20+ years of research and teaching of intercultural communication, we have joined with the university to expand our vision from serving primarily local language and cultural needs to those found in wider global contexts.” "
